Methods and Results: Suspensions of vaccinia poxvirus and endospores of Bacillus subtilis were used at defined concentrations as a model for poxviruses and spores of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), both of which are pathogens that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. Negative staining electron microscopy was performed directly or after sedimentation of these suspensions on to the sample supports using airfuge ultracentrifugation. For both virus and spores, the detection limit using direct adsorption of a 10\u2010\u03BCl sample volume onto the sample support was 10(6) particles per ml. Using airfuge ultracentrifugation with a sample volume of 80 \u03BCl, the detection limit could be reduced to 10(5) particles per ml for spores and to 5 \u00D7 10(4) particles per ml for poxviruses. The influence on particle detection of incubation time, washing and adsorption procedures was investigated. Conclusions: The reproducibility and sensitivity of the method were acceptable, particularly considering the small sample volume and low particle number applied onto the sample support. Significance and Impact of the Study: Diagnostic negative staining electron microscopy is used for the diagnosis of pathogens in emergency situations because it allows a rapid examination of all particulate matter down to the nanometre scale.

The respiratory effects of prolonged respirator use on pregnant women are unclear although there has been no definite evidence of harm from past use. METHODS: We conducted a two-phase controlled clinical study on healthy pregnant women between 27 to 32 weeks gestation. In phase I, energy expenditure corresponding to the workload of routine nursing tasks was determined. In phase II, pulmonary function of 20 subjects was measured whilst at rest and exercising to the predetermined workload while breathing ambient air first, then breathing through N95-mask materials. RESULTS: Exercising at 3 MET while breathing through N95-mask materials reduced mean tidal volume (TV) by 23.0 % (95 % CI \u221233.5 % to \u221210.5 %, p \u003C 0.001) and lowered minute ventilation (VE) by 25.8 % (95 % CI \u221234.2 % to \u221215.8 %, p \u003C 0.001), with no significant change in breathing frequency compared to breathing ambient air. Volumes of oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and carbon dioxide expired (VCO(2)) were also significantly reduced; VO(2) by 13.8 % (95 % CI \u221224.2 % to \u22123 %, p = 0.013) and VCO(2) by 17.7 %, (95 % CI \u221228.1 % to \u22128.6 %, p = 0.001). Although no changes in the inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were demonstrated, breathing through N95-mask materials during low intensity work (3 MET) reduced expired oxygen concentration by 3.2 % (95 % CI: \u22124.1 % to \u22122.2 %, p \u003C 0.001), and increased expired carbon dioxide by 8.9 % (95 % CI: 6.9 % to 13.1 %; p \u003C0.001) suggesting an increase in metabolism. There were however no changes in the maternal and fetal heart rates, finger-tip capillary lactate levels and oxygen saturation and rating of perceived exertion at the work intensity investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Breathing through N95 mask materials have been shown to impede gaseous exchange and impose an additional workload on the metabolic system of pregnant healthcare workers, and this needs to be taken into consideration in guidelines for respirator use. The benefits of using N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against potential respiratory consequences associated with extended N95 respirator usage.

In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during infection and the underlying mechanisms. We found that CCoV-II triggers apoptosis in A-72 cells by activating initiator (caspase-8 and -9) and executioner (caspase-3 and -6) caspases. The proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) confirmed the activation of executioner caspases. Furthermore, CCoV-II infection resulted in truncated bid (tbid) translocation from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial fraction, the cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and alterations in the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of bcl-2 family. Our data indicated that, in this experimental model, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are involved.

Changes in gene expression in the hepatopancreas following infection with TSV and Yellow Head Virus (YHV) were assessed using a cDNA microarray containing 2469 putative unigenes. The null hypothesis tested was that significant differences between the transcriptomic responses to viral infection of resistant and sensitive strains would not be detected. This hypothesis was broadly rejected, with the most surprising observation being that the baseline (control, unchallenged) sensitive and resistant strains expressed distinguishable transcriptomic signatures. The resistant line was pre-disposed to lower expression of genes encoding viral (and host) proteins. Many of the genes differentiating resistant and sensitive lines are involved in protein metabolism, cellular trafficking, immune defense and stress response, although it was not possible to clearly identify candidate genes responsible for TSV resistance.

It is the most common lower respiratory tract condition and most common reason for admission to hospital in infants. Many respiratory viruses have been associated with acute viral bronchiolitis although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains the most frequently identified virus. Most infants have a mild self limiting illness while others have more severe illness and require hospital admission and some will need ventilatory support. Differences in innate immune function in response to the respiratory viral insult as well as differences in the geometry of the airways may explain some of the variability in clinical pattern. Young age and history of prematurity remain the most important risk factors although male gender, indigenous status, exposure to tobacco smoke, poor socioeconomic factors and associated co-morbidities such as chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease increase the risks of more severe illness. Supportive therapy remains the major treatment option as no specific treatments to date have been shown to provide clinically important benefits except for inhaled hypertonic saline. Prophylaxis of high risk infants with palivizumab should be considered although the cost effectiveness is still unclear. Many questions remain regarding optimal management approaches for infants requiring hospitalisation with bronchiolitis including use of nasogastric feeding, the optimal role of supplemental oxygen, optimal use of hypertonic saline and the role of combinations of therapies, the use of heliox or modern physiotherapy approaches.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wainwright, Claire","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65a3cea47a77c89b9c55abacd9a3a20b134354dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106315.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054209000694; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054209000694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20113991/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2009.10.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["young infants","respiratory viral insult","optimal use of hypertonic saline","respiratory viruses","severe illness","respiratory syncytial virus","Summary Acute viral bronchiolitis","Prophylaxis of high risk infants","use of heliox","optimal management approaches","important risk factors","Differences","hospital admission","common lower respiratory tract condition","optimal role of supplemental oxygen","use of nasogastric feeding","inhaled hypertonic saline","common reason","role of combinations","important benefits","Young age","identified virus","chronic lung disease","poor socioeconomic factors","congenital heart disease","modern physiotherapy approaches","exposure","indigenous status","cause of substantial morbidity","tobacco smoke","co-morbidities","male gender","response","hospitalisation","health care costs","major treatment option","specific treatments","innate immune function","history of prematurity","palivizumab","risks","RSV","Supportive therapy","therapies","variability","date","airways","questions","mild self","cost effectiveness","ventilatory support","clinical pattern"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to microglia, oligodendroglia are resistant to CD8 T cell perforin\u2010mediated viral control in the absence of IFN\u03B3. Kinetic induction of MHC Class I expression by microglia and oligodendroglia in vivo was thus analyzed to assess responses to distinct inflammatory signals. Flow cytometry demonstrated delayed Class I surface expression by oligodendroglia compared with microglia. Distinct kinetics of Class I protein upregulation correlated with cell type specific transcription patterns of genes encoding Class I heavy chains and antigen processing components. Microglia isolated from na\u00EFve mice expressed high levels of these mRNAs, whereas they were near detection limits in oligodendroglia; nevertheless, Class I protein was undetectable on both cell types. Infection induced modest mRNA increases in microglia, but dramatic transcriptional upregulation in oligodendroglia coincident with IFN\u03B1 or IFN\u03B3 mRNA increases in infected tissue. Ultimately mRNAs reached similar levels in both cell types at their respective time points of maximal Class I expression. Expression of Class I on microglia, but not oligodendroglia, in infected IFN\u03B3 deficient mice supported distinct IFN requirements for Class I presentation. These data suggest an innate immune preparedness of microglia to present antigen and engage CD8 T cells early following infection. The delayed, yet robust, IFN\u03B3 dependent capacity of oligodendroglia to express Class I suggests strict control of immune interactions to avoid CD8 T cell recognition and potential presentation of autoantigen to preserve myelin maintenance. \u00A9 2008 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2008-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malone, Karen E.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Ramakrishna, Chandran; Macklin, Wendy; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Glia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb6bc03f06dead8e79159e79f46ae11cfe218aff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18205173/; https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.20625","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Expression of Class","delayed Class","express Class","Distinct kinetics of Class","cell types","oligodendroglia coincident","CD8 T cell recognition","CD8 T cell perforin","IFN\u03B3 dependent capacity of oligodendroglia","CD8 T cells","CD8 T cell mediated effector mechanisms","IFN\u03B3 mRNA","Kinetic induction of MHC Class","innate immune preparedness of microglia","respective time points of maximal Class","absence of IFN\u03B3","infected IFN\u03B3 deficient mice","protein upregulation","mRNAs","following infection","cell type specific transcription patterns of genes","distinct IFN requirements","neurotropic coronavirus infection","distinct inflammatory signals","present antigen","strict control of immune interactions","viral control","na\u00EFve mice","high levels","infected tissue","modest mRNA","similar levels","dramatic transcriptional upregulation","potential presentation of autoantigen","antigen processing components","IFN\u03B1","heavy chains","Glia exhibit differential susceptibility","near detection limits","myelin maintenance","Flow cytometry","data","responses","contrast","Wiley","Liss"],"language":"en"},

A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities, limiting population\u0027s mobility and prohibiting almost all avoidable activities. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM10, NO2 and SO2) in Sal\u00E9 city (North-Western Morocco) during the lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM10, SO2 and NO2 was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the lockdown period were respectively 75%, 49% and 96% for PM10, SO2 and NO2. PM10 levels were much less reduced than NO2. The three-dimensional air mass backward trajectories, using the HYSPLIT model, demonstrated the benefits of PM10 local emission reductions related to the lockdown were overwhelmed by the contribution of long-range transported aerosols outside areas. In addition, noteworthy differences in the air mass back trajectories and the meteorology between these two periods were evidenced.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otmani, Anas; Benchrif, Abdelfettah; Tahri, Mounia; Bounakhla, Moussa; Chakir, El Mahjoub; El Bouch, Mohammed; Krombi, M\u0027hamed","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9d8c02f4bb776f80bf68840caff6916854fa8db.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139541; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720330588; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720330588?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NO2","PM10 levels","SO2","lockdown measures","lockdown period","air pollutants","continuous measurement of PM10","concentrations","three-dimensional air mass backward trajectories","benefits of PM10 local emission reductions","security measures","North-Western Morocco","studied pollutants","Abstract Covid","emissions","locking","control actions","HYSPLIT model","Sal\u00E9 city","Moroccan government","population\u0027s mobility","vehicle exhaust","noteworthy differences","contribution of long-range transported aerosols","strict countermeasures","areas","industrial production","meteorology","state of health emergency","set of rapid","cities","consequence","addition","context","changes","avoidable activities","obtained results","propagation","decrease","present study","periods"],"language":"en"},

Clinical providers and pharmacists are reporting the immunizations given to their patients to public health registries in 49 states and all territories, creating consolidated immunization event patient records. Most of these immunization events are reported through the provider\u2019s Electronic Health Record system (EHR), Pharmacy Management System (PMS), online, or through data uploads. Meaningful Use and health data standards (HL7) became the drivers that accelerated reporting to immunization registries and significantly improved the quantity and quality of the data. The infrastructure supporting the Immunization Ecosystem (IE) has enabled real-time compliance reporting and, more importantly, real-time patient queries. The provider community now has online access to a patient\u2019s immunization history in over three quarters of the states, and growing. This access includes a forecast of the patient\u2019s immunization gaps provided by public health decision support tools based upon the most recent ACIP recommendations. This is creating an opportunity for the provider and the patient to work together to reduce their risk of suffering a vaccine-preventable disease. This IE and the data in an Immunization Information System (IIS) are especially useful as pharmacies expand their immunization practices and create opportunities to reduce the adolescent and adult immunization gaps. In a few states, this provider-public health ecosystem has begun to extend to individuals by allowing them to access the IIS online through the use of MyIR. MyIR provides them with the electronic version of their immunization \u0022yellow cards,\u0022 recommendations for immunizations due, and the ability to print official certificates. This emerging consumer engagement creates opportunities to empower individuals to be more proactive in their family\u2019s health care. This paper builds upon early experiments to empower individuals in this ecosystem by leveraging the value of these public health data assets and trusted communications, illustrating the possibilities for engaging consumers to support reducing the impact of emerging diseases, outbreaks and the next pandemic. This paper will suggest the value of the IE and the role individuals can play within their own social networks to advance public health efforts to manage disease events. In turn, this social mission would encourage consumers to be more proactive in managing their own healthcare.","publish_time":"2018-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popovich, Michael L.; Watkins, Todd; Kudia, Ousswa","journal":"Online J Public Health Inform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad512ced9c178a408dba4c56b96034fc7e894678.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6194094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30349621/; https://doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v10i2.9147","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Public Health","Electronic Health Record","Pharmacy Management System","ACIP","Immunization Information System","IIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunization ecosystem","Public Health immunization registries","immunization events","immunization practices","public health registries","public health data assets","provider-public health ecosystem","public health efforts","health data standards","patient\u2019s immunization gaps","Immunization Information System","patient\u2019s immunization history","adult immunization gaps","public health decision support tools","significant population health data assets","family\u2019s health care","consolidated immunization event patient records","data uploads","provider\u2019s Electronic Health Record system","states","online access","role individuals","immunizations","opportunities","IIS","value","disease events","provider community","real-time patient queries","use of MyIR","real-time compliance reporting","paper","Pharmacy Management System","electronic version","social networks","social mission","Meaningful Use","engaging consumers","impact of emerging diseases","emerging consumer engagement","recent ACIP recommendations","vaccine-preventable disease","EHR","trusted communications","territories","yellow cards","decades","drivers","HL7","outbreaks","possibilities","pharmacies","adolescent","quarters","forecast","quantity","patients","early experiments","ability","pharmacists","PMS","Clinical providers","official certificates","risk","pandemic","turn","quality","opportunity","infrastructure","healthcare"],"language":"en"},

Using a Lysozyme-M-cre (LysMcre) expression system, we show that deletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes Fip200, beclin 1, Atg14, Atg16L1, Atg7, Atg3, and Atg5, in the myeloid compartment, inhibited MHV68 reactivation in macrophages. Atg5-deficiency did not alter reactivation from B cells, and effects on reactivation from macrophages were not explained by alterations in productive viral replication or the establishment of latency. Rather, chronic MHV68 infection triggered increased systemic inflammation, increased T cell production of IFN-\u03B3 and an IFN-\u03B3-induced transcriptional signature in macrophages from Atg gene-deficient mice. The Atg5-related reactivation defect was partially reversed by neutralization of IFN-\u03B3.

Gene mutations that disturb this turnover process may cause skin diseases. Human GASDERMIN A (GSDMA) is frequently silenced in gastric cancer cell lines and its overexpression has been reported to induce apoptosis. GSDMA has also been linked with airway hyperresponsiveness in genetic association studies. The function of GSDMA in the skin was deduced by dominant mutations in mouse gasdermin A3 (Gsdma3), which caused skin inflammation and hair loss. However, the mechanism for the autosomal dominance of Gsdma3 mutations and the mode of Gsdma3\u2019s action remain unanswered. RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel function of Gsdma3 in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress. We showed that Gsdma3 is regulated by intramolecular fold-back inhibition, which is disrupted by dominant mutations in the C-terminal domain. The unmasked N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 associates with Hsp90 and is delivered to mitochondrial via mitochondrial importer receptor Tom70, where it interacts with the mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 and causes increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 as well as pharmacological interventions of mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and MPT pore opening alleviate the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genetic mutations in the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 are gain-of-function mutations which unmask the N-terminal functional domain of Gsdma3. Gsdma3 regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress through mitochondrial targeting. Since mitochondrial ROS has been shown to promote epidermal differentiation, we hypothesize that Gsdma3 regulates context-dependent response of keratinocytes to differentiation and cell death signals by impinging on mitochondria.

Planning effective public health control measures for such a case will be highly dependent on sound theory-based research on how people perceive the risks involved in such an event. PURPOSE: The present article aims to review theoretical models and concepts underlying current empirical research on pandemic influenza risk perception. METHOD: A review was conducted based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007. RESULTS: Concepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory-based and were highly heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components. Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based. CONCLUSIONS: The current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights. Unlike the reviewed studies, which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations, future research will have to invest more strongly into theoretical work to provide sounder evidence.","publish_time":"2009-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leppin, Anja; Aro, Arja R.","journal":"Int J Behav Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19214752/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-008-9002-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Concepts of risk perception","pandemic influenza risk perception","risk perceptions","empirical studies","sound theory-based research","current empirical research","terms of conceptualizing risk perception","future research","global pandemic influenza outbreak","outbreak situations","expectancy","majority of studies","reviewed studies","theoretical models","theoretical work","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","current body of knowledge","threat","case","protective behaviors","effective public health control measures","subsequent emergence","rapid response","H5N1 virus","present article","instance","people","emotional phenomenon","sounder evidence","CONCLUSIONS","risks","BACKGROUND","value components","RESULTS","preliminary insights","PURPOSE","articles","event","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to investigate the effects and mode-of-action of 6-TG on rotavirus replication. Human intestinal Caco2 cell line, 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids, laboratory rotavirus strain (SA11) and patient-derived rotavirus isolates were used. We have demonstrated that 6-TG significantly inhibits rotavirus replication in these intestinal epithelium models. Importantly, gene knockdown or knockout of Rac1, the cellular target of 6-TG, significantly inhibited rotavirus replication, indicating the supportive role of Rac1 for rotavirus infection. We have further demonstrated that 6-TG can effectively inhibit the active form of Rac1 (GTP-Rac1), which essentially mediates the anti-rotavirus effect of 6-TG. Consistently, ectopic over-expression of GTP-Rac1 facilitates but an inactive Rac1 (N17) or a specific Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) inhibits rotavirus replication. In conclusion, we have identified 6-TG as an effective inhibitor of rotavirus replication via the inhibition of Rac1 activation. Thus, for transplantation patients or IBD patients infected with rotavirus or at risk of rotavirus infection, the choice of 6-TG as a treatment appears rational.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Yuebang; Chen, Sunrui; Hakim, Mohamad S.; Wang, Wenshi; Xu, Lei; Dang, Wen; Qu, Changbo; Verhaar, Auke P.; Su, Junhong; Fuhler, Gwenny M.; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P.; Pan, Qiuwei","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9afe908babd48784b72535b7d9b3d964d1cc6b14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113846.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.06.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217308446; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217308446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TG","inhibited rotavirus replication","risk of rotavirus infection","Abstract Rotavirus infection","effective inhibitor of rotavirus replication","GTP-Rac1","laboratory rotavirus strain","anti-rotavirus effect","knockout of Rac1","inactive Rac1","patient-derived rotavirus isolates","supportive role of Rac1","specific Rac1 inhibitor","active form of Rac1","inhibition of Rac1 activation","IBD patients","treatment of IBD","organ recipients","organ transplantation recipients","transplantation patients","intestinal epithelium models","Human intestinal Caco2 cell line","D model of human primary intestinal organoids","ectopic over-expression of GTP","SA11","important cause of complications","N17","pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease","NSC23766","immunosuppressive drug","cellular target","action","choice","effects","gene knockdown","clinic","study","Thioguanine","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Most patients presenting to British ambulance services are discharged at scene. Ambulance records are therefore an ideal data source for syndromic early event detection systems to monitor infectious disease in the prehospital population. It has been previously found that tympanic temperature records can be used to detect influenza outbreaks in emergency departments. This study investigated whether routine tympanic temperature readings collected by ambulance crews can be used to detect seasonal influenza. Here we show that these temperature readings do allow the detection of seasonal influenza before methods applied to conventional data sources. The counts of pyretic patients were used to calculate a sliding case ratio (CR) as a measurement to detect seasonal influenza outbreaks. This method does not rely on conventional thresholds and can be adapted to the data. The data collected correlated with seasonal influenza. The 2016/17 outbreak was detected with high specificity and sensitivity, up to 9 weeks before other surveillance programs. An unanticipated outbreak of E. coli was detected in the same dataset. Our results show that ambulance records can be a useful data source for biosurveillance systems. Two outbreaks caused by different infectious agents have been successfully detected. The routine ambulance records allowed to use tympanic temperature readings that can be used as surveillance tool for febrile diseases. Therefore, this method is a valuable addition to the current surveillance tools.","publish_time":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reich, Thilo; Budka, Marcin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a434b56631a29f3fc656c28a90bf1c5a3214a7b7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/94df380f8a3bab7e30d39cc9d7e95d1f302f5f9f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/462341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["routine ambulance records","tympanic temperature records","seasonal influenza outbreaks","detection of seasonal influenza","ambulance crews","routine tympanic temperature readings","ideal data source","useful data source","British ambulance services","conventional data sources","introduction of electronic patient records","surveillance programs","current surveillance tools","infectious disease","biosurveillance systems","conventional thresholds","prehospital population","unanticipated outbreak of","syndromic early event detection systems","different infectious agents","counts of pyretic patients","methods","valuable addition","measurement","new opportunities","study","sliding case ratio","sensitivity","coli","high specificity","weeks","febrile diseases","scene","emergency departments","results","dataset"],"language":"en"},

The endogenous ER-retained immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, protein disulfide isomerase, and a peptide containing the KDEL amino acid sequence appeared in the soma and dendrites up to their first branching, but not in axons. However, two other endogenous ER-associated proteins, calreticulin and calnexin, occurred in axons as well as in the somatodendritic domains. The ER-associated rotavirus proteins, VP7 and NSP4, were widely distributed in cell bodies and dendrites. The former appeared also in axons and its localization partially overlapped with that of calreticulin and calnexin. One intermediate compartment protein, ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment-protein-53 (ERGIC-53), extended beyond the first division of the dendrites and did not, as the small guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein rab2, appear in axons. The location of rab2 to small vesicles was distinct from that of rotavirus VP7. Cis /medial Golgi cistern proteins were restricted to the cell bodies and proximal dendrites. This study emphasizes the marked heterogeneity in the targeting to axons and dendrites of proteins associated with ER and intermediate compartments. Therefore, the composition of axonal ER-retained molecules differs from that in the soma and this variation may reflect differences in functions between the ER compartments. Viral proteins are useful reporters for such heterogeneities and rotavirus VP7 may be a tool to reveal sorting signals for targeting of vesicular proteins to axons via a nonclassical Golgi-independent mechanism. Such signals may also determine viral targeting to different regions of the brain.","publish_time":"1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weclewicz, Katarzyna; Svensson, Lennart; Kristensson, Krister","journal":"Brain Research Bulletin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75f4a5dd419292368c22ea83133201ab5b4551ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126376.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0361923098000136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923098000136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KDEL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER-Golgi","dendrites of proteins","endogenous ER-associated proteins","axons","ER compartments","synthesized ER-associated rotavirus proteins","Viral proteins","vesicular proteins","intermediate compartment protein","intermediate compartment-protein","distribution of endogenous proteins","composition of axonal ER","medial Golgi cistern proteins","rotavirus VP7","binding protein rab2","intermediate compartments","proximal dendrites","Golgi apparatus","viral targeting","protein disulfide isomerase","immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein","calreticulin","sorting signals","cell bodies","calnexin","nonclassical Golgi-independent mechanism","compartmentalization of molecules","small vesicles","location of rab2","small guanosine","peptide","cultures of dorsal root ganglion","DRG","neuronal endomembranes","useful reporters","endoplasmic reticulum","KDEL amino acid sequence","triphosphate","GTP","differences","heterogeneities","NSP4","different regions","functions","marked heterogeneity","tool","variation","brain","hippocampal neurons","study","localization","ERGIC","branching","somatodendritic domains","division"],"language":"en"},

However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10% mortality and evidence of systemic spread(2). Recently, another coronavirus (human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection(3,4). Viral genome analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats(5). Here we identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding S1 domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells. Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may facilitate the development of intervention strategies.

In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hern\u00E1ndez, A.; Papadakos, P.

For example, bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be seen in patients with allergic rhinitis. This could represent coexistent but unrecognized asthma, but also suggests that IgE-dependent inflammation may occur in the lower airway that can increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness without at the same time precipitating obvious obstruction. Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A second example of the interaction of upper airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are reports that viral upper respiratory tract infections may cause otherwise healthy persons to respond abnormally to inhaled histamine or irritants for several months after the infections. These same viruses usually precipitate attacks in patients with asthma, who already have hyperresponsive airways. Both of these examples suggest that inflammatory processes occurring totally or primarily in the upper airway may participate in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract hyperresponsiveness and asthma.","publish_time":"1988-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eggleston, Peyton A.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20448440752dbeed0d351c55597598066f13a576.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091674988901765; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0091674988901765","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower airway","bronchial hyperresponsiveness","interaction of upper airway inflammation","unrecognized asthma","viral upper respiratory tract infections","pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract hyperresponsiveness","bronchial hyperreactivity","patients","allergic rhinitis","Abstract Inflammatory processes","IgE-dependent inflammation","healthy persons","precipitate attacks","risk factor","time precipitating obvious obstruction","histamine","irritants","months","viruses","hyperresponsive airways","examples"],"language":"en"},

The TAM receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl and MerTK) mediates the non-inflammatory removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes through the bridging phosphatidylserine-binding molecules Gas6 or Protein S. We show that one such TAM receptor (Axl) is exclusively expressed on mouse airway macrophages, but not interstitial macrophages and other lung leukocytes, under homeostatic conditions and is constitutively ligated to Gas6. Axl expression is potently induced by GM-CSF expressed in the healthy and inflamed airway, and by type I interferon or TLR3 stimulation on human and mouse macrophages, indicating potential involvement of Axl in apoptotic cell removal under inflammatory conditions. Indeed, an absence of Axl does not cause sterile inflammation in health, but leads to exaggerated lung inflammatory disease upon influenza infection. These data imply that Axl allows specific identification of airway macrophages, and that its expression is critical for macrophage functional compartmentalisation in the airspaces or lung interstitium. We propose that this may be a critical feature to prevent excessive inflammation due to secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells that have not been cleared by efferocytosis.","publish_time":"2015-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujimori, Toshifumi; Grabiec, Aleksander M; Kaur, Manminder; Bell, Thomas J; Fujino, Naoya; Cook, Peter C; Svedberg, Freya R; MacDonald, Andrew S; Maciewicz, Rose A; Singh, Dave; Hussell, Tracy","journal":"Mucosal Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9c05a5c33ef91bbf61d086c882b60a5e6510b21.json; document_parses/pdf_json/abce345b56e4e322a5e0bae794966544c0494d9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4430298.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/mi.2014.129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25603826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Protein S."],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Axl expression","absence of Axl","mouse macrophages","mouse airway macrophages","potential involvement of Axl","interstitial macrophages","specific identification of airway macrophages","inflammatory conditions","non-inflammatory removal of apoptotic cells","apoptotic cell removal","macrophage functional compartmentalisation","exaggerated lung inflammatory disease","examining inflammation","lung leukocytes","macrophage functional specificity","macrophage phenotype","excessive inflammation","lung interstitium","sterile inflammation","inflamed airway","TAM receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases","secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells","homeostatic conditions","critical feature","tissue-specific environmental triggers","bridging phosphatidylserine-binding molecules Gas6","phagocytes","Tyro3","MerTK","TLR3 stimulation","influenza infection","airspaces","Protein","interferon","health","GM-CSF","homeostasis","polarising signals","biology","data","efferocytosis"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The basic characteristics, time and area distributions, clinical manifestations, epidemiological history and transmission mode of the COVID-19 cases associated with the department store exposure were analyzed. Results: A total of 40 COVID-19 cases were associated with the department store exposure, accounting for 75.47% of the total confirmed cases (53 cases) reported in Baodi district. The cases were mainly at the age of 60 years or older (35.00%) and farmers (40.00%). The main clinical manifestations included fever (95.00%), cough (35.00%), and diarrhea (15.00%). The proportion of confirmed severe cases was 32.50%. The incidence curve showed that the incidence peak occurred on 31 January, 2020. Among the 40 cases, 6(15.00%) were department store employees, 19(47.50%) were customers and 15(37.50%) were close contacts (secondary cases). The first case occurred on 21 January, 2020, this case was a department store employee who had a purchasing history at whole sale markets in other provinces and cities before the onset, and 3 employees were still on duty after symptom onsets. The median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days. Conclusion: This was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19, which might be associated with the exposure in the department store.

TLR are a family of type 1 transmembrane proteins, responsible for recognizing molecular patterns associated with pathogens (PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns), and expressed by a broad spectrum of infectious agents. This recognition leads to quick production of cytokines and chemokines which provides a long-lasting adaptive response to the pathogen. Currently, it is considered that the administration of drugs which modulate the activity of these receptors upwards or downwards may represent major therapeutic progress for handling these diseases. The aim of this review is to describe the different TLS, define their possible role in the pathogenesis of the main respiratory diseases and finally, speculate over the therapeutic possibilities which their modulation, agonist or antagonist, offers as possible therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2009-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crespo-Lessmann, Astrid; Ju\u00E1rez-Rubio, C\u00E1ndido; Plaza-Moral, Vicente","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115790.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2009.07.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19765883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["possible role","possible therapeutic targets","molecular patterns","pathogenesis","therapeutic possibilities","receptors","TLR","major therapeutic progress","main respiratory diseases","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","chemokines","example","asthma","PAMP","transmembrane proteins","antagonist","family of type","quick production of cytokines","study of innate immunity","long-lasting adaptive response","infections","modulation","different TLS","pathogens","broad spectrum of infectious agents","review","recognition","years","activity","administration of drugs","aim"],"language":"en"},

Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic. The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale (VELTAS) was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies. Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: 1) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), 2) Chronic Venous Disease (CVD), 3) Vascular anomalies, 4) Venous trauma 5) Venous compression and 6) Lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage. These included 1) Medical Emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; 2) Urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis ; 3) Semi-urgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic CVD, and 4) Discretionary/Non-urgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema. VELTAS aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency. The scale may be used during pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis but may also be used as a general framework to classify urgency of the listed conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parsi, Kurosh; van Rij, Andre M.; Meissner, Mark H.; Davies, Alun H.; De Maeseneer, Marianne; Gloviczki, Peter; Benson, Stephen; Bottini, Oscar; Canata, Victor Manuel; Dinnen, Paul; Gasparis, Antonios; Gianesini, Sergio; Huber, David; Jenkins, David; Lal, Brajesh K.; Kabnick, Lowell; Lim, Adrian; Marston, William; Granados, Alberto Martinez; Morrison, Nick; Nicolaides, Andrew; Paraskevas, Peter; Patel, Malay; Roberts, Stefania; Rogan, Christopher; Schul, Marlin W.; Komlos, Pedro; Stirling, Andrew; Thibault, Simon; Varghese, Roy; Welch, Harold J.; Wittens, Cees H.A.","journal":"J.

The Decision provides a context for the present study, which aims to identify good practices and lessons learned in preparedness and response to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (in UK, Greece, and Spain) and poliomyelitis (in Poland and Cyprus). METHODS: Based on a documentary review, followed by five week-long country visits involving a total of 61 interviews and group discussions with experts from both the health and non-health sectors, this qualitative case study has investigated six issues related to preparedness and response to MERS and poliomyelitis: national plans and overall preparedness capacity; training and exercises; risk communication; linking policy and implementation; interoperability between the health and non-health sectors; and cross-border collaboration. RESULTS: Preparedness and response plans for MERS and poliomyelitis were in place in the participating countries, with a high level of technical expertise available to implement them. Nevertheless, formal evaluation of the responses to previous public health emergencies have sometimes been limited, so lessons learned may not be reflected in updated plans, thereby risking mistakes being repeated in future. The nature and extent of inter-sectoral collaboration varied according to the sectors involved, with those sectors that have traditionally had good collaboration (e.g. animal health and food safety), as well as those that have a financial incentive for controlling infectious diseases (e.g. agriculture, tourism, and air travel) seen as most likely to have integrated public health preparedness and response plans. Although the formal protocols for inter-sectoral collaboration were not always up to date, good personal relations were reported within the relevant professional networks, which could be brought into play in the event of a public health emergency. Cross-border collaboration was greatly facilitated if the neighbouring country was a fellow EU Member State. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious disease outbreaks remain as an ongoing threat. Efforts are required to ensure that core public health capacities for the full range of preparedness and response activities are sustained.

These cleavage products are believed to play essential roles in replication of the giant RNA genome of \u223C30 kb and transcription of a nested set of 5 to 9 subgenomic RNA species by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism. In this report, one of these replicase proteins, nsp9 of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is systematically studied using both biochemical and reverse genetic approaches. The results showed that substitution mutation of a conserved Gly (G98) residue in the C-terminal \u03B1-helix domain with an Asp greatly destabilized the IBV nsp9 homodimer and abolished its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the same mutation into an infectious IBV clone system showed that the mutation totally abolishes the transcription of subgenomic RNA and no infectious virus could be recovered. Mutation of a semi-conserved Ile (I95) residue in the same region showed moderately destabilizing effect on the IBV nsp9 homodimer but minimal effect on its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the mutation into the IBV infectious clone system showed recovery of a mutant virus with severe growth defects, supporting that dimerization is critical for the function of this replicase protein. Meanwhile, mutations of some positively charged residues in the \u03B2-barrel regions of the IBV nsp9 protein significantly reduced its RNA-binding activity, but with no obvious effect on dimerization of the protein. Introduction of these mutations into the viral genome showed only mild to moderate effects on the growth and infectivity of the rescued mutant viruses.","publish_time":"2009-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Bo; Fang, Shouguo; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cd6a85ee99d001010ff12d5ca023b02708b68bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103386.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208007071; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.10.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022466/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208007071","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV nsp9 protein","IBV nsp9 homodimer","RNA-binding activity","transcription of subgenomic RNA","infectious IBV clone system","IBV infectious clone system","infectious virus","subgenomic RNA species","giant RNA genome","substitution mutation","Introduction","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","minimal effect","destabilizing effect","obvious effect","dimerization","nonstructural replicase proteins","mutations","conserved Gly","viral genome","unique discontinuous transcription mechanism","large polyproteins","ab polyproteins","severe growth defects","semi-conserved Ile","rescued mutant viruses","recovery","infectivity","Asp","moderate effects","C-terminal \u03B1-helix domain","\u03B2-barrel regions","essential roles","I95","replication","G98","quarters","coding capacity","residues","nsp1","function","nested set","reverse genetic approaches","cleavage products","Abstract Coronaviruses","results","report"],"language":"en"},

A case of severe tracheobronchitis in a laryngectomee is presented that illustrates the risks and difficulties encountered in managing this infection in a neck breather. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old Caucasian man, a laryngectomee, presented with bacterial tracheobronchitis and conjunctivitis due to beta-lactamase-producing nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. He was febrile (38.9 \u00B0C; 102.0 F), and had repeated episodes of hypertension. He was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg/day, ciprofloxacin eye drops, acetaminophen, and guaifenesin. Humidification of his trachea and the airway was sustained by insertions of saline into the stoma as well as breathing humidified air. The main challenge was to maintain the patency of his airway as the mucus was very dry and viscous and tended to stick to the walls of his trachea and the stoma. His condition improved within 7 days and he had a complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining the patency of the airway in laryngectomees who suffer from lower respiratory tract infection is of utmost importance as the mucus can be very dry and viscous and can stick to the walls of the trachea and the stoma.","publish_time":"2018-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brook, Itzhak","journal":"J Med Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36c123eb9cf765e87991924a21da9bdf32e7dc85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6100715.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30124173/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-018-1764-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway","trachea","stoma cover","Laryngectomees","mucus","patency","case of severe tracheobronchitis","walls","lower respiratory tract infection","severe respiratory tract infections","bacterial tracheobronchitis","CASE PRESENTATION","beta-lactamase","utmost importance","ciprofloxacin eye drops","acetaminophen","conjunctivitis","year-old Caucasian man","nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae","days","guaifenesin","winter","insertions of saline","repeated episodes of hypertension","complete recovery","levofloxacin","neck breather","difficulties","main challenge","risks","BACKGROUND","humidified air","Humidification","condition","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Trophoblasts produce numerous immunomodulators that play a role in placental development and pregnancy maintenance. We hypothesized that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression, and aberrant expression of these molecules may potentiate inflammation and compromise pregnancy. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the expression of representative pro-(TNF-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3, IL-1\u03B2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, and GM-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10); CD134, a secondary co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells (FIV primary receptor); the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (FIV co-receptor); SDF-1\u03B1, the chemokine ligand to CXCR4; and FIV gag in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. METHODS: We used an anti-cytokeratin antibody in immunohistochemistry to identify trophoblasts selectively, collected these cells using laser capture microdissection, and extracted total RNA from the captured cell populations. Real time, reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantify gene expression. RESULTS: We detected IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1\u03B2, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and CXCR4 in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. Expression of cytokines increased from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. A clear, pro-inflammatory microenvironment was not evident in trophoblasts from FIV-infected queens at either stage of pregnancy. Reproductive failure was accompanied by down-regulation of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. CD134 was not detected in trophoblasts, and FIV gag was detected in only one of ten trophoblast specimens collected from FIV-infected queens. CONCLUSION: Feline trophoblasts express an array of pro-and anti-inflammatory immunomodulators whose expression increases from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. Non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species. The detection of FIV RNA in trophoblasts was rare, suggesting that the high rate of reproductive failure in FIV-infected queens was not a direct result of viral replication in trophoblasts. The influence of placental immune cells on trophoblast function and pregnancy maintenance in the FIV-infected cat requires additional study.","publish_time":"2011-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scott, Veronica L; Shack, Leslie A; Eells, Jeffrey B; Ryan, Peter L; Donaldson, Janet R; Coats, Karen S","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ec08de8b92b3b6c9be98dcd92db0ddf3efdad44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3152912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21729293/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","FIV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IL-12p35","IL-12p40","FIV infection","FIV gag","late pregnancy","FIV-infected queens","Expression of cytokines","pregnancy maintenance","FIV co-receptor","FIV-infected cat","FIV primary receptor","aberrant expression","stage of pregnancy","Feline trophoblasts","compromise pregnancy","late-term pregnancy","detection of FIV RNA","expression increases","gene expression","expression of representative pro-","decreased expression of immunomodulators","dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression","placental cytokines","anti-inflammatory cytokines","anti-inflammatory immunomodulators","chemokine receptor CXCR4","trophoblast function","trophoblast invasion","trophoblast specimens","array of pro-","influence of placental immune cells","pro-inflammatory microenvironment","placental development","numerous immunomodulators","CD134","normal tissues","activated T cells","chemokine ligand","total RNA","TNF-\u03B1","high rate of reproductive failure","secondary co-stimulatory molecule","role","direct result of viral replication","IFN-\u03B3","molecules","experimental conditions","SDF","reverse transcription-PCR","laser capture microdissection","anti-cytokeratin antibody","Real time","captured cell populations","immunohistochemistry","additional study","inflammation","GM-CSF","Non-viable pregnancies","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","METHODS","species","project","purpose","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia model was used to evaluate antipyretic activity in Wistar rats. The anti-inflammatory and antipyretic mechanisms were evaluated by detecting prostaglandins E(2), nitric oxide, interleukin-1\u03B2 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 levels using appropriate reagents and ELISA kits.

We developed a data-driven method, EpiGro, which can be applied to cumulative case reports to estimate the order of magnitude of the duration, peak and ultimate size of an ongoing outbreak. It is based on a surprisingly simple mathematical property of many epidemiological data sets, does not require knowledge or estimation of disease transmission parameters, is robust to noise and to small data sets, and runs quickly due to its mathematical simplicity. Using data from historic and ongoing epidemics, we present the model. We also provide modeling considerations that justify this approach and discuss its limitations. In the absence of other information or in conjunction with other models, EpiGro may be useful to public health responders.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lega, Joceline; Brown, Heidi E.","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80b3189ee52e8f3ef0889095e4cf5cc2277563d8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c5ff0e8849181e53f6cd7b5479c3fa62487f578f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5159251.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2016.10.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770752/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436516300329","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemiological data sets","small data sets","EpiGro","ongoing outbreak","data-driven method","infectious disease outbreak response","ongoing epidemics","mathematical simplicity","simple mathematical property","estimation of disease transmission parameters","spotlight","noise","knowledge","duration","ultimate size","order of magnitude","conjunction","models","public health responders","cumulative case reports","approach","information","Recent events","modeling considerations","absence","limitations"],"language":"en"},

The relatively small, 123 amino acid, N protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, presents an ideal model system for investigating the properties and mechanism of N protein nucleolar localization. The PRRSV N protein is found in both cytoplasmic and nucleolar compartments during infection and after transfection of gene constructs that express N-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins. Experiments using oligopeptides, truncated polypeptides and amino acid-substituted proteins have identified several domains within PRRSV N protein that participate in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, including a cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS) called NLS-1, a functional NLS (NLS-2), a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS), as well as a possible nuclear export signal (NES).

Study design After retrieving 163,433 news records mentioning the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 pandemics, a maximum entropy model for inductive machine learning was used to identify relationships among 500 randomly sampled news records that correlated with systematic human assessments of their scientific quality and sensationalism. These relationships were then computationally applied to automatically classify 10,000 additional randomly sampled news records. The model was validated by randomly sampling 200 records and comparing human assessments of them to the computer assessments. Results The computer model correctly assessed the relevance of 86% of news records, the quality of 65% of records, and the sensationalism of 73% of records, as compared to human assessments. Overall, the scientific quality of SARS and H1N1 news media coverage had potentially important shortcomings, but coverage was not too sensationalizing. Coverage slightly improved between the two pandemics. Conclusion Automated methods can evaluate news records faster, cheaper, and possibly better than humans. The specific procedure implemented in this study can at the very least identify subsets of news records that are far more likely to have particular scientific and discursive qualities.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffman, Steven J.; Justicz, Victoria","journal":"Journal of Clinical Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ca1a1c3ca665b86971a5d9d9da6fec6f71edaf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26854419/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2015.12.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435616000913; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435616000913","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sampled news records","subsets of news records","sensationalism of individual news records","H1N1 news media coverage","scientific quality of SARS","computer assessments","systematic human assessments","computer model","H1N1 pandemics","relationships","maximum entropy model","Study design","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","inductive machine learning","important shortcomings","Conclusion Automated methods","relevance","discursive qualities","specific procedure","Abstract Objective","humans"],"language":"en"},

Background Mixed bacterial infection is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality during influenza pandemics. We evaluated procalcitonin (PCT) and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) in differentiating pneumonia caused by mixed bacterial and 2009 H1N1 influenza infection from 2009 H1N1 influenza infection alone. Methods Data were collected retrospectively over a 7\u2010month period during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Patients visiting emergency department and diagnosed as community\u2010acquired pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 infection were included (n = 60). Results Mixed bacterial and viral infection pneumonia (n = 16) had significantly higher PCT and CRP levels than pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 influenza alone (n = 44, P = 0\u00B7019, 0\u00B7022 respectively). The sensitivity and specificity for detection of mixed bacterial infection pneumonia was 56% and 84% for PCT \u003E 1\u00B75 ng/ml, and 69% and 63% for CRP \u003E 10 mg/dl. Using PCT and CRP in combination, the sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion Procalcitonin and CRP alone and their combination had a moderate ability to detect pneumonia of mixed bacterial infection during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Considering high specificity, combination of low CRP and PCT result may suggest that pneumonia is unlikely to be caused by mixed bacterial infection.","publish_time":"2011-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahn, Shin; Kim, Won Young; Kim, Sung\u2010Han; Hong, SangBum; Lim, Chae\u2010Man; Koh, YounSuck; Lim, Kyung Soo; Kim, Won","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9741eab85f5510655de379d9e3c11f5bf0d2d560.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780656.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668682/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00244.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 infection","pneumonia of mixed bacterial infection","H1N1 influenza infection","detection of mixed bacterial infection pneumonia","viral infection pneumonia","differentiation of mixed bacterial infection","H1N1 viral pneumonia","H1N1 influenza pandemic","differentiating pneumonia","H1N1 pandemic","influenza pandemics","CRP levels","combination of low CRP","PCT result","higher PCT","reactive protein","high specificity","Role of procalcitonin","sensitivity","Conclusion Procalcitonin","morbidity","important contributor","mortality","moderate ability","Results","month period","emergency department","community","Background","Ahn","Patients","Respiratory Viruses","Methods Data","paper"],"language":"en"},

One example includes adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), that are extensively detected in several animals, especially primates. To understand AAVs distribution and genetic diversity in the coastal areas of Southeast China, a total of 415 intestine samples were mostly collected from two provinces of southeast China, i.e., Zhejiang and Fujian province. Intestine samples from five bat species were collected for AAVs detection. The average prevalence rate for AAV detection among these samples was 18.6% (77 positives out of 415 samples) and ranged from 11.8 to 28.9% between the five bat species. This suggests that AAVs are widely distributed in diverse bat populations in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the genome sequence of bat adeno-associated virus-CXC1(BtAAV-CXC1) from one AAV-positive sample, the genetic diversity of the detected AAVs were assessed and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BtAAV-CXC1 was comparatively distant to other major AAVs from mammals and non-mammals, with only a 52.9~64.7% nucleotide identity. However, they were phylogenetically closer to Rhinolophus sinicus bat adeno-associated virus (Rs-BtAAV1), with a 74.5% nt similarity. Partial analysis of the rep and cap overlapping open reading frame (ORF) sequences from bat AAV samples revealed 48 partial rep sequences and 23 partial cap sequences from positive samples shared 86.9 to 100% and 72.3 to 98.8% nucleotide identities among themselves, respectively. This suggests that the detected AAVs had a distinctly high genetic diversity. These findings led us to conclude that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations from the southeast regions of China.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Changqiang; Wang, Chunhui; Wu, Jiahong; Ye, Fuqiang; Lv, Ruichen; Hu, Dan; Ai, Lele; Yang, Lu; Wu, Ting; Li, Bo; Ding, Chenxi; Zhang, Bin; Lv, Heng; Wang, Changjun; Tan, Weilong","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e4de1d7982eb2ce67d340a63175adfdab398686.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7048818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32111911/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60721-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AAV"],"locations":["Southeast China","Zhejiang","China"],"keyphrases":["detected AAVs","bat AAV samples","AAVs detection","diverse AAVs","bat species","major AAVs","AAVs distribution","positive samples","intestine samples","diverse bat populations","Rhinolophus sinicus bat adeno-associated virus","genome sequence of bat adeno-associated virus-CXC1","coastal areas of Southeast China","southeast coastal areas of China","adeno-associated viruses","southeast regions of China","provinces of southeast China","partial cap sequences","partial rep sequences","BtAAV-CXC1","AAV detection","Partial analysis","high genetic diversity","AAV-positive sample","non-mammals","Phylogenetic analysis","nucleotide identity","nucleotide identities","important zoonotic viruses","ORF","open reading frame","total","average prevalence rate","different families","Zhejiang","Rs-BtAAV1","example","Fujian province","Bats","positives","animals","primates","nt similarity","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, classical PEDV vaccine strains only provide limited protection against emerging strains. In this study, we successfully isolated and attenuated the PEDV epidemic strain Zhejiang08, which was characterized by good cell adaptation and high-titer production 48 h post infection in Vero E6 cells. The attenuated virus induced a high level of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies until 120 days after immunization in piglets and provided complete protection when challenged with an emerging virus strain on day 14 post immunization. Moreover, the capability to activate dendritic cells (DCs) of this isolate was identified. Higher expression levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03B3 were recorded in DCs after treatment with Zhejiang08 for 24 h. Furthermore, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed high homology between the main antigen epitopes of Zhejiang08 and PEDV pandemic isolates following 2011. Combining the glycosylation site prediction results and their distribution within the spatial structure of the S protein, led to the conclusion that the observed more effective host immune response of Zhejiang08 compared to CV777 was possibly associated with a lack of the potential glycosylation site in the 296 amino acids of the S protein. In summary, we illustrated that the attenuated virus represents a promising vaccine candidate.","publish_time":"2017-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yuchen; Wang, Guihua; Wang, Jialu; Man, Kun; Yang, Qian","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99da3adecbf75588f2b231f28a660d32a8ed5829.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115645.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100707/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.052; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17314603; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17314603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated virus","PEDV epidemic strain Zhejiang08","high level of virus","emerging virus strain","classical PEDV vaccine strains","high homology","post immunization","PEDV pandemic isolates","emerging strains","DCs","S protein","main antigen epitopes of Zhejiang08","high-titer production","potential glycosylation site","effective host immune response of Zhejiang08","limited protection","complete protection","glycosylation site prediction results","dendritic cells","h post infection","Vero E6 cells","promising vaccine candidate","porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus","specific neutralizing antibodies","distribution","phylogenetic analysis","significant damage","amino acids","days","good cell adaptation","genome sequencing","spatial structure","global pork industry","IFN-\u03B3","CV777","lack","conclusion","piglets","Higher expression levels of IL","capability","treatment","Abstract","study","summary"],"language":"en"},

While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Zhiqiang; Monteil, Vanessa M.; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Yew, Chow Wenn; Leong, Carol; Mohd-Ismail, Nur Khairiah; Arularasu, Suganya Cheyyatraivendran; Chow, Vincent Tak Kwong; Pin, Raymond Lin Tzer; Mirazimi, Ali; Hong, Wanjin; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a33f451d8e2caff57c1133f14198454a64993c47.json; document_parses/pdf_json/94d9fcb3a8d1b9710a953ff7305d85d1cb04bcd4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.980037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerged SARS-CoV","CoV S","glycoprotein of SARS","immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment","S2 domain of SARS","S2 subunit of SARS","S protein of SARS","multiple strains of SARS","immunogenic domain","cross-reactive mAbs","research","host cell receptor","coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain","novel coronavirus","cross-reactivity","high sequence conservation","mammalian cell line","murine monoclonal antibodies","associated coronavirus disease COVID","RBD","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","development of diagnostic assays","angiotensin","tools useful","etiological agent","ACE2","enzyme","observation","order","surface spike","widespread human infections","globe","study","emergence","infected cells","virus entry","end","mAb 1A9","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

I wish to emphasize and thank the Guest Editors of this special issue, Yvan Saeys and Greg Finak, for their outstanding success and hard work to assemble excellent manuscripts for this issue. I am referring to their guest editorial giving you more details on aims and scopes and elaborating on specific articles. I started drafting this editorial while attending the annual Photonics West conference in San Francisco, presumably the largest showcase on photonics technologies and instrumentation. Scientifically, the sub\u2010conference BIOS demonstrated the broadness and vividness of photonics technologies in life sciences and particularly in single cell analysis. When searching for relevant literature for this editorial, I was also tracking the actual global developments. This brought me to change my focus and comment on some issues that are relevant to our field and somewhat related to that of the special issue. First of all, Nature Methods announced their Method of the Year 2019 1. It is: \u201CSingle\u2010cell multimodal omics\u201D and acknowledges (among others) the important contribution of highly multiplexed flow cytometry and cell sorting to the increased understanding of single cell biology and cell systems. This is motivating and confirms that cytometry is receiving the focus of attention. Concurrently, in the last weeks the relevance of the recent COVID\u201019 (2019\u2010nCoV) outbreak and its effects started to become evident as everybody was monitoring the number of cases registered globally 2. As conference chairs, we were facing the fact that many of our speakers and colleagues became unavailable. Not only that, but the eeriness of the infection (it is transmissible already during its asymptomatic latency period of up to two weeks, recent results indicate even longer) gave many attendees an uneasy feeling. This brings me to two points worth discussing. (a) Are large scale conferences with global attendance still state of the art or should they be rethought; and (b) to what extent can cytometry support global efforts in various fields of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases? In the past one to two decades the world faced several outbreaks of different viral infections that were luckily not as disastrous as initially anticipated but still claimed victims. These were coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) in 2002/2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) with occasional outbreaks since 2012 or influenza viruses like the H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010. It is only a matter of time until other pandemics follow. Global travel for work and leisure supports viral spread and can transport the infection to nearly all places of the globe within days. Global conferences contribute to such a rapid spread and one should reconsider this model of scientific exchange from time to time and scrutinize potential alternatives. Models for sustainable international conferences are under testing and combine venues in close proximity to institutions with a substantial expertise on the focus area of the conference with virtual participation and contribution by internet for participants on more distant places. Although personal meetings are essential for optimal information exchange, a reduction in travel would not only reduce the risk of dissemination of disease but, as a side effect, could result in budgetary savings, reduce travel\u2010related emissions (in the wake of Greta), and eliminate jetlag. Now, what can Cytometry do for help in pandemics? Cytometry has already supported several achievements as a quick and non\u2010representative literature search shows. Image cytometry methods 3 and bead\u2010based flow cytometry methods 4 are at hand to enable for screening and detecting antibody virus interactions and detect viral antigens. Airway memory T\u2010cells and viral E protein mutations have been identified in CoV infections a potential targets for vaccine strategies 5, 6. Immune responses seem to be indicative of disease severity 6, 7 but more studies are needed to have a practical assay for decision making at hand. In fact, easy to use and rapid assays derived from Cytomics or multi\u2010OMICS approaches are needed to rapidly distinguish severe from mild cases and identify future critically ill individuals before symptom onset. Such a test would clearly take the pressure off of the clinicians because only those with high probability to becoming critically ill would receive intensive care early. Hopefully we will see more related studies in this journal in the near future.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"T\u00E1rnok, Attila","journal":"Cytometry A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecdcb7097da27b47f0d7b034c573de255bb0b466.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162219.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.23990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Yvan Saeys","Greg Finak"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Global conferences","Global travel","Single Cell Data","single cell analysis","cell sorting","cell systems","special issue","cytometry support global efforts","global attendance","guest editorial","cell multimodal omics","increased understanding of single cell biology","conference chairs","multiplexed flow cytometry","actual global developments","annual Photonics West conference","occasional outbreaks","vividness of photonics technologies","viral spread","month","focus area","matter of time","sub\u2010conference BIOS","weeks","relevant literature","comment","focus of attention","pandemics","outbreaks of different viral infections","sustainable international conferences","large scale conferences","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","hard work","related emissions","important contribution","rapid spread","distant places","recent COVID","Guest Editors","recent results","various fields of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases","optimal information exchange","model of scientific exchange","non\u2010representative literature search shows","MERS","San Francisco","Greg Finak","life sciences","testing","internet","largest showcase","virtual participation","SARS","broadness","close proximity","outstanding success","substantial expertise","Yvan Saeys","Machine Learning","institutions","influenza viruses","venues","participants","world","extent","leisure","personal meetings","budgetary savings","excellent manuscripts","achievements","instrumentation","reduction","issues","asymptomatic latency period","speakers","effects","scopes","nCoV","H1N1 pandemic","wake of Greta","coronaviruses","decades","Models","relevance","details","potential alternatives","Nature Methods","risk of dissemination","primary plan","attendees","uneasy feeling","colleagues","specific articles","fact","Year","globe","days","help","number of cases","jetlag","eeriness","points","victims","hand","Image cytometry methods","based flow cytometry methods","viral antigens","ill individuals","near future","related studies","viral E protein mutations","cells","bead","CoV infections","rapid assays","Cytomics","potential targets","antibody virus interactions","Airway memory T","vaccine strategies","mild cases","multi\u2010OMICS approaches","screening","journal","symptom onset","indicative of disease severity","practical assay","clinicians","high probability","decision","Immune responses","pressure","intensive care"],"language":"en"},

We convened a multidisciplinary SARS task force, and five team members were given responsibility for writing the plan. During that time, we learned that respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette guidelines were being developed by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC). There was also a threat of a heavy early flu season, and we needed to provide easy access to hygiene supplies in all hospital and clinic waiting areas and lobbies. PROJECT: The SARS planning group came up with an idea for a \u201Csneeze station\u201D since our policy required that facial tissues, hand sanitizers, waste receptacles, masks, and instructional signage be readily available in all hospital and clinic lobbies and waiting rooms. We took our idea to the director of plant operations and the sneeze station concept was approved. A carpenter was assigned to develop a prototype, and after a few minor revisions by the SARS task force the sneeze station was born. Wall-mounted and rolling floor models were designed to accommodate the various space needs in our facility. It was decided that masks would not be placed on the sneeze stations, but would be available at all reception desks due to concerns of inappropriate use. Our faculty and staff were educated on the respiratory hygiene policy and sneeze stations during the February 2004 mandatory safety fair. RESULTS: As of January 2005, we have placed 180 sneeze stations in our hospitals and clinics as well as in other institutions. When new areas open, one of the first concerns is to make sure they get their sneeze stations. The sneeze stations are continuously being used based on audits of supply usage and through monitoring by the environment of care (EOC) tours. LESSONS LEARNED: The sneeze stations are accepted in the medical center as a valuable part of infection control. There are times when supply cannot keep up with demand because we only have one carpenter assigned to manufacture the sneeze stations. Another lesson learned is that placing the station in a cafeteria may result in it being used as a food disposal instead of for its intended purpose. Overall, the sneeze station has met with great success, and this proves that creative ideas can bring about change.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffner, P.; Wilkerson, K.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655305003135; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655305003135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sneeze stations","sneeze station concept","respiratory hygiene policy","multidisciplinary SARS task force","hygiene supplies","SARS planning group","clinic lobbies","masks","facility","carpenter","response plan","possible re-emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee","concerns of inappropriate use","audits of supply usage","new areas open","waste receptacles","hand sanitizers","facial tissues","director of plant operations","monitoring","HICPAC","instructional signage","environment of care","reception desks","team members","cough etiquette guidelines","threat","heavy early flu season","minor revisions","medical center","clinics","easy access","various space needs","great success","EOC","tours","prototype","responsibility","PROJECT","mandatory safety fair","rooms","staff","hospitals","state health department","food disposal","intended purpose","floor models","Wall","demand","LESSONS","creative ideas","faculty","institutions","times","cafeteria","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Currently no potent and selective CBS inhibitors are available. Using a composite collection of 8871 clinically used drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds (including the LOPAC library, the FDA Approved Drug Library, the NIH Clinical Collection, the New Prestwick Chemical Library, the US Drug Collection, the International Drug Collection, the \u0060Killer Plates\u0027 collection and a small custom collection of PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitors), we conducted an in vitro screen in order to identify inhibitors for CBS using a primary 7-azido-4-methylcoumarin (AzMc) screen to detect CBS-derived hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) production. Initial hits were subjected to counterscreens using the methylene blue assay (a secondary assay to measure H(2)S production) and were assessed for their ability to quench the H(2)S signal produced by the H(2)S donor compound GYY4137. Four compounds, hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid and benserazide showed concentration-dependent CBS inhibitory actions without scavenging H(2)S released from GYY4137, identifying them as direct CBS inhibitors. Hexachlorophene (IC(50): ~60 \u03BCM), tannic acid (IC(50): ~40 \u03BCM) and benserazide (IC(50): ~30 \u03BCM) were less potent CBS inhibitors than the two reference compounds AOAA (IC(50): ~3 \u03BCM) and NSC67078 (IC(50): ~1 \u03BCM), while aurintricarboxylic acid (IC(50): ~3 \u03BCM) was equipotent with AOAA. The second reference compound NSC67078 not only inhibited the CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence signal (IC(50): ~1 \u03BCM), but also inhibited with the GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence signal with (IC(50) of ~6 \u03BCM) indicative of scavenging/non-specific effects. Hexachlorophene (IC(50): ~6 \u03BCM), tannic acid (IC(50): ~20 \u03BCM), benserazide (IC(50): ~20 \u03BCM), and NSC67078 (IC(50): ~0.3 \u03BCM) inhibited HCT116 colon cancer cells proliferation with greater potency than AOAA (IC(50): ~300 \u03BCM). In contrast, although a CBS inhibitor in the cell-free assay, aurintricarboxylic acid failed to inhibit HCT116 proliferation at lower concentrations, and stimulated cell proliferation at 300 \u03BCM. Copper-containing compounds present in the libraries, were also found to be potent inhibitors of recombinant CBS; however this activity was due to the CBS inhibitory effect of copper ions themselves. However, copper ions, up to 300 \u03BCM, did not inhibit HCT116 cell proliferation. Benserazide was only a weak inhibitor of the activity of the other H(2)S-generating enzymes CSE and 3-MST activity (16% and 35% inhibition at 100 \u03BCM, respectively) in vitro. Benserazide suppressed HCT116 mitochondrial function and inhibited proliferation of the high CBS-expressing colon cancer cell line HT29, but not the low CBS-expressing line, LoVo. The major benserazide metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine also inhibited CBS activity and suppressed HCT116 cell proliferation in vitro. In an in vivo study of nude mice bearing human colon cancer cell xenografts, benserazide (50 mg/kg/day s.q.) prevented tumor growth. In silico docking simulations showed that benserazide binds in the active site of the enzyme and reacts with the PLP cofactor by forming reversible but kinetically stable Schiff base-like adducts with the formyl moiety of pyridoxal. We conclude that benserazide inhibits CBS activity and suppresses colon cancer cell proliferation and bioenergetics in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Further pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and preclinical animal studies are necessary to evaluate the potential of repurposing benserazide for the treatment of colorectal cancers.","publish_time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Druzhyna, Nadiya; Szczesny, Bartosz; Olah, Gabor; M\u00F3dis, Katalin; Asimakopoulou, Antonia; Pavlidou, Athanasia; Szoleczky, Petra; Ger\u00F6, Domokos; Yanagi, Kazunori; T\u00F6r\u00F6, Gabor; L\u00F3pez-Garc\u00EDa, Isabel; Myrianthopoulos, Vassilios; Mikros, Emmanuel; Zatarain, John R.; Chao, Celia; Papapetropoulos, Andreas; Hellmich, Mark R.; Szabo, Csaba","journal":"Pharmacological Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/908f7e4b137cd4ee1a460fa1de97d47c3d1b6eea.json; document_parses/pdf_json/84e44effbdcb3af03c815957ba63ea357327eeb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5107130.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5107130?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27521834/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661816305151; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661816305151; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2016.08.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Benserazide"],"organizations":["FDA Approved Drug Library","NIH Clinical Collection","US Drug Collection","International Drug Collection","CBS","AOAA","CSE","PLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCM","CBS activity","high CBS","low CBS","potent CBS inhibitors","selective CBS inhibitors","direct CBS inhibitors","potent inhibitors of recombinant CBS","HCT116 proliferation","inhibited proliferation","colon cancer cell proliferation","suppressed HCT116 cell proliferation","stimulated cell proliferation","CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence signal","CBS inhibitory effect of copper ions","CBS-derived hydrogen sulfide","aurintricarboxylic acid","tannic acid","S signal","HCT116 colon cancer cells proliferation","concentration-dependent CBS inhibitory actions","potential of repurposing benserazide","major benserazide metabolite","S production","colon cancer cell line HT29","US Drug Collection","International Drug Collection","cell-free assay","human colon cancer cell xenografts","composite collection","dependent enzyme inhibitors","forms of cancer","MST activity","reference compounds AOAA","S donor compound GYY4137","hexachlorophene","NIH Clinical Collection","Killer Plates\u0027 collection","GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence signal","small custom collection of PLP","drug target","HCT116 mitochondrial function","reference compound NSC67078","FDA Approved Drug Library","LOPAC library","secondary assay","tumor growth","well-annotated pharmacological compounds","methylene blue assay","New Prestwick Chemical Library","PLP cofactor","weak inhibitor","indicative of scavenging","greater potency","drugs","trihydroxybenzylhydrazine","lower concentrations","bioenergetics","study of nude mice","preclinical animal studies","pharmacodynamic","counterscreens","treatment of colorectal cancers","enzymes CSE","azido","stable Schiff base","non-specific effects","methylcoumarin","silico docking simulations","Cystathionine-\u03B2","synthase","active site","LoVo","order","formyl moiety of pyridoxal","Initial hits","day","contrast","libraries","ability","inhibition"],"language":"en"},

Remarkably, a lower than expected similarity is found between the complete genomes and more in particular between the spike genes of the BE03 and BE04 strains. This finding suggests the existence of two genetically distinct HCoV-OC43 strains, circulating in Belgium in 2003 and 2004. Spike gene sequencing of three additional 2003 and two additional 2004 HCoV-OC43 strains, and subsequent phylogenetic analysis confirm this assumption. Compared to the ATCC prototype HCoV-OC43 strain, an important amino acid substitution is present in the potential cleavage site sequence of the spike protein of all contemporary strains, restoring the N-RRXRR-C motif, associated with increased spike protein cleavability in bovine coronaviruses.

Illegal products of animal origin may contain hazardous infectious agents that can compromise animal and public health. The aim of this study was to identify associations between possession of illegal animal products in baggage and demographic characteristics of the passengers, as well as characteristics of their travel plans in the two main Brazilian international airports. A total of 457 passengers were divided into two groups: passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products and control. Passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products not stated on the accompanied baggage declaration completed a questionnaire, to aid in profiling. Nationality, origin, age and residency of passengers were analyzed using chi square, logistic regression and odds ratios. Passengers from Eastern Europe were the most likely to enter with animal products as were those aged between 35 and 55 years.

The HTLV-1 structural genes are responsible for the synthesis of proteins involved in the entry, assembly and release of particles during viral infection. To examine the possibility of silencing HTLV-1 genes gag and env by RNA interference technology, these genes were cloned into reporter plasmids.

We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yun; Guo, Yao; Pan, Yihang; Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe","journal":"Biochem Biophys Res Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe69099d9491aa640dd66e8d606651c262755361.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092824.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20303399; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20303399; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32081428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV RBD","interaction of ACE2","flexible loop","molecular simulation","SARS-CoV","Molecular modeling","structural analysis","flexible glycyl residues","small molecular inhibitors","distinct loop","stronger interaction","rigid prolyl residues","conserved primary structures","similar ternary structures","possible natural hosts","animal kingdom","spike glycoprotein responsible","entry of coronaviruses","fish","receptor binding domain","amino acid sequences","reptiles","penetration","amphibians","high similarity","identified coronavirus","angiotensin","major role","deep hydrophobic pocket","kidney","fecal-oral","birds","identity","unique phenylalanine F486","enzyme","host cells","routes of transmission","testis","antibodies","intestines","animals","mammals","respiratory droplets","RBDs"],"language":"en"},

Prevention of viral propagation is of primordial importance in shelters and catteries, where cats from different backgrounds have narrow contacts. Oligonucleotides (ODN) containing cytosine-phosphate-guanosine motifs of class A (CpG-A) are highly potent synthetic inducers of innate antiviral mechanisms. The aim of this study was to test their ability to modulate innate immune responses and prevent viral replication as stand-alone agents in the domestic cat. CpG-A stimulation of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) enhanced their proliferation, increased the presence of co-stimulatory molecules on their surface and influenced their gene expression profiles in an antiviral orientation. Incubation of the supernatants of CpG-A stimulated PBMCs with feline cell lines of epithelial and fibroblastic origin induced expression of the antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene in these target cells, which also showed enhanced resistance to feline viruses from five distinct families, namely Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and Retroviridae. Most importantly, subcutaneous administration of CpG-A in domestic cats systemically increased the expression of Mx, reaching maximal levels within 24 h. Plasma from treated cats could furthermore inhibit viral replication in vitro. Altogether, our data highlight the promising potential of CpG-A to induce a preventive antiviral state in the cat and to protect feline populations against a broad range of virus infections.","publish_time":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robert-Tissot, C\u00E9line; R\u00FCegger, Vera L; Cattori, Valentino; Meli, Marina L; Riond, Barbara; Moore, Peter F; Engels, Monika; Franchini, Marco; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc5761e9d769b9fb1e723e1932ee3c5d4e21bd0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3537549.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22906110/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-43-60","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Domestic cats","viral replication","supernatants of CpG","feline populations","feline viruses","expression of Mx","antiviral orientation","viral pathogens","treated cats","antiviral myxovirus resistance","promising potential of CpG","subcutaneous administration of CpG","gene expression profiles","Prevention of viral propagation","preventive antiviral state","enhanced resistance","feline cell lines of epithelial","stimulation of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells","potent synthetic inducers of innate antiviral mechanisms","stimulated PBMCs","target cells","lengthy infections","innate immune responses","broad range of virus infections","fibroblastic origin","catteries","surface","primordial importance","distinct families","stand-alone agents","cytosine-phosphate","Coronaviridae","Herpesviridae","different backgrounds","shelters","guanosine motifs of class","maximal levels","presence of co-stimulatory molecules","Caliciviridae","Parvoviridae","ability","narrow contacts","Plasma","proliferation","fatal outcomes","ODN","data","study","Oligonucleotides","Retroviridae","Incubation","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the physical and functional relationships between these proteins and the translation machinery. We describe a previously unknown type of diauxic shift-dependent modulation of the intracellular locations of Dhh1 and Pat1. Like the formation of P bodies, this phenomenon changes the spatial relationship between components involved in translation and mRNA degradation. We report significant spatial separation of Dhh1 and Pat1 from ribosomes in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, biochemical analyses reveal that these proteins are excluded from polysomal complexes in exponentially growing cells, indicating that they may not be associated with active states of the translation machinery. In contrast, under diauxic growth shift conditions, Dhh1 and Pat1 are found to co-localize with polysomal complexes. This work suggests that Dhh1 and Pat1 functions are modulated by a re-localization mechanism that involves eIF4A. Pull-down experiments reveal that the intracellular binding partners of Dhh1 and Pat1 change as cells undergo the diauxic growth shift. This reveals a new dimension to the relationship between translation activity and interactions between mRNA, the translation machinery and decapping activator proteins.","publish_time":"2011-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drummond, Sheona P.; Hildyard, John; Firczuk, Helena; Reamtong, Onrapak; Li, Ning; Kannambath, Shichina; Claydon, Amy J.; Beynon, Robert J.; Eyers, Claire E.; McCarthy, John E.

HP is a wide and complex domain: systems in this domain are large (in terms of size and scope) integrated (each subsystem cannot be considered as an isolated system) and different in purpose. Such systems require a multidisciplinary approach for their design and analysis and they are necessarily required to provide data and information fusion in the most general sense. The first data fusion algorithms employed in real systems in the radar field go back to the early seventies; now a days new concepts have been developed and spread to be applied to very complex systems with the aim to achieve the highest level of intelligence as possible and hopefully to support decision. Data fusion is aimed to enhance situation awareness and decision making through the combination of information/data obtained by networks of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous sensors. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the several approaches that can be followed to design and analyze systems for homeland protection. Different fusion architectures can be drawn on the basis of the employed algorithms: they are analyzed under several aspects in this chapter. Real study cases applied to real world problems of homeland protection are provided in the chapter.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farina, Alfonso; Ortenzi, Luciana; Ristic, Branko; Skvortsov, Alex","journal":"Academic Press Library in Signal Processing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79218b7084ef4c8e3fb854a04a61a35a5efaf6c2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123965004000223; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123965004000223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real systems","information fusion","complex systems","data fusion algorithms","chapter","design of integrated systems","application of data","Different fusion architectures","complex domain","real world problems of homeland protection","combination of information","HP","decision","aim","employed algorithms","Real study cases","early seventies","radar field","networks of homogeneous","multidisciplinary approach","situation awareness","days new concepts","highest level of intelligence","terms of size","isolated system","scope","purpose","analysis","basis","general sense","heterogeneous sensors","subsystem","overview","approaches","aspects"],"language":"en"},

The lack of a defined classification system for medicinal cordyceps fungi is a source of confusion in the industry and the public, and even among pharmaceutical scientists. This review summarizes the cordyceps fungi currently used in the industry in China with a special reference to clarify Chinese cordyceps and associated fungi.

P. hepiali is a cordyceps fungus based on current phylogenetic analysis of Hypocreales, while M. hepiali is a fungus in the Zygomycetes and should only be treated as associated fungus of Chinese cordyceps. C. sinensis and C. rosea belong to the Hypocreales and their relationship to cordyceps fungi should be further studied.

The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of a potent topical steroid, fluticasone propionate, on patients with early signs and symptoms of the common cold. To characterize the mucosal inflammatory response, salivary defense factors and flow rate in these patients were analyzed. Study Design. Forty patients with symptoms of the common cold were randomized into 2 groups to receive either high-dose fluticasone propionate (100 \u03BCg per nostril) or placebo 4 times daily for 6 days. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva was collected on day 1 (before the onset of medication), day 7 (posttreatment), and day 21 (follow-up). Results. Salivary flow rate, innate host defense factors, and total protein content were not affected by the common cold. IgA increased between day 7 and day 21 (P \u2264 .01; Student 2-tailed t test), and the relative proportions of salivary peroxidase and IgA increased on day 7 (P = .01) and day 21 (P = .05). In patients receiving fluticasone, saliva flow rate was lower on day 21 (P \u2264 .05) than on days 1 and 7. The innate salivary defense factors were not affected, but IgA increased both on day 7 (P \u2264 .001) and on day 21 (P \u2264 .001) in comparison with day 1. Conclusions. Of the oral mucosal defense factors, only IgA is activated during the common cold. Intranasally administrated fluticasone propionate does not have a suppressive effect on salivary antimicrobial capacity.

A striking finding was that IFN-\u03B1 SC could be detected in the fetal liver as early as at 26 days of gestation, i.e., during the first quarter of gestation, a period at which T-cell markers could not be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, IFN-\u03B1 SC could be detected in the cord blood, the spleen and the bone marrow of fetuses at later stages of gestation. These data indicate that IFN-\u03B1 SC appear very early during the ontogeny of the immune system, long before the development of the specific immune system, and may therefore represent an early antiviral defence mechanism.

Rural patients presented for clinical care at older ages and had less annual visits to clinic. Persons travelled relatively long distances to seek SCD care and those travelling longer had less health maintenance visits. Urban patients had a higher prevalence of significant pain crises (69.4% vs. 55.8%, p value\u003C0.001) and respiratory events (21.2% vs. 14%, p value\u003C0.001). Prevalence of leg ulcers did not vary between rural and urban patients but was higher in males than in females. Females also had lower odds of having respiratory events but there was no sex difference in history of painful crises. Persons with more severe genotypes lived in higher poverty and travelled longer for healthcare services. Persons in areas with higher annual rainfall, higher mean temperatures and living farther from factories had less painful crises and respiratory events.

All rights reserved Abstract: A simple clinical screening (CS) tool for respiratory virus (RV) infection was introduced and evaluated in a single hematology ward, as part of a strategy to reduce nosocomial RV infection. Up to 6 clinical symptoms or signs were scored and a predefined threshold score of \u22652 prompted paired nose/throat swab (NTS) collection for RV testing. The criterion standard for RV infection was positive immunofluorescence (IF) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 7 and 15 viruses, respectively. The tool was shown to be most beneficial at excluding infection at a threshold score of 1 (negative predictive value [NPV] 89%, [95% confidence interval 78\u201396%], sensitivity 85% [70\u201394%], specificity 35% [27\u201343%]), compared with a score of 2 (NPV 85% [76\u201391%], sensitivity 63% [46\u201377%], specificity 57% [48\u201365%]) at a prevalence of 22%. The tool\u0027s ability to diagnose infection was limited (positive predictive value 27% and 29% at thresholds 1 and 2). The sensitivity of IF compared with PCR was 45% for the 7 viruses common to both, and 23% for the extended virus panel detected by PCR. An algorithm incorporating CS, paired NTS collection at a threshold of 1 symptom or sign, and sensitive testing including PCR can guide infection control measures in hospitalized hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.","publish_time":"2011-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferguson, P.E.; Gilroy, N.M.; Sloots, T.P.; Nissen, M.D.; Dwyer, D.E.; Sorrell, T.C.","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bd5743e3df7c86642112d8bd971c6711888c767.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169734.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3062.2011.00631.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21501357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P.E.

It has been reported that a water extract of H. cordata exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), although the mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Previous studies have demonstrated absolute requirement of NF-\u03BAB activation for efficient replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation has been shown to suppress HSV infection. Here we show that a hot water extract of H. cordata (HCWE) inhibits HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation. The IC50 was estimated at 50\u03BCg/ml of lyophilized HCWE powder. At 150 and 450\u03BCg/ml, HCWE blocked infectious HSV-2 production by more than 3 and 4 logs, respectively. The inhibitory activity was concomitant with an inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation by HSV-2 infection. Although activation of NF-\u03BAB and Erk MAPK has been implicated for HSV replication and growth, HCWE showed no effect on HSV-2-induced Erk activation. Furthermore, we show that treatment with quercetin, quercitrin or isoquercitrin, major water extractable flavonoids from H. cordata, significantly blocked HSV-2 infection. These results together demonstrated that H. cordata blocks HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaoqing; Wang, Zhongxia; Yang, Ziying; Wang, Jingjing; Xu, Yunxia; Tan, Ren-xiang; Li, Erguang","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eec2605140f0856096789a10421729e4ba9d4e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114259.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211004438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21951655/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.09.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211004438","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","HCWE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV infection","HSV replication","activation of NF","\u03BAB activation","blocked HSV","infectious HSV","cordata blocks HSV","inhibition of NF","efficient replication of HSV","induced Erk activation","cordata exhibits activity","absolute requirement of NF","Abstract Houttuynia cordata Thunb","hot water extract of","lyophilized HCWE powder","\u03BCg","major water extractable flavonoids","inhibitory activity","Erk MAPK","herpes simplex virus","virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome","isoquercitrin","folk medicine","SARS","quercetin","effect","concomitant","growth","Previous studies","medicinal plant","Asian countries","treatment","production","results","mechanisms","IC50","logs"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to compare with a monocentric study the impact of late viral and bacterial respiratory infections on the graft function. METHODS: Patients, who survived 6 months or more following lung transplantation that took place between 2009 and 2014, were classified into three groups: a viral infection group (VIG) (without any respiratory bacteria), a bacterial infection group (BIG) (with or without any respiratory viruses), and a control group (CG) (no documented infection). Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and acute rejection were analysed 6 months after the inclusion in the study. RESULTS: Among 99 included lung recipients, 57 (58%) had at least one positive virological respiratory sample during the study period. Patients were classified as follows: 38 in the VIG, 25 in the BIG (among which 19 co-infections with a virus) and 36 in the CG. The BIG presented a higher initial deterioration in lung function (p = 0.05) than the VIG. But 6 months after the infection, only the VIG presented a median decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 s; \u2212 35 mL (IQR; \u2212 340; \u002B 80) in the VIG, \u002B 140 mL (\u002B 60;\u002B 330) in the BIG and \u002B 10 (\u2212 84;\u002B 160) in the CG, p \u003C 0.01. Acute rejection was more frequent in the VIG (n = 12 (32%)), than the BIG (n = 6 (24%)) and CG (n = 3 (8%)), p \u003C 0.05, despite presenting no more CLAD (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a less severe initial presentation, single viral respiratory infections seem to lead to a greater deterioration in lung function, and to more acute rejection, than bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dubert, Marie; Visseaux, Benoit; Birgy, Andr\u00E9; Mordant, Pierre; Metivier, Anne-C\u00E9cile; Dauriat, Gaelle; Fidouh, Nadhira; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Grall, Nathalie; Castier, Yves; Mal, Herv\u00E9; Thabut, Gabriel; Lescure, Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e0851ed44e0459ff83448af23b81560a41ede72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7041086.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-4877-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32093612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VIG","bacterial respiratory infections","lung function","bacterial infections","CG","single viral respiratory infections","respiratory bacteria","respiratory viruses","viral infection group","bacterial infection group","co-infections","included lung recipients","acute rejection","months","following lung transplantation","documented infection","positive virological respiratory sample","Chronic lung allograft dysfunction","graft function","control group","monocentric study","study period","Patients","impact of late viral","higher initial deterioration","greater deterioration","severe initial presentation","major threat","expiratory volume","median decrease","place","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","groups","CONCLUSIONS","inclusion","IQR","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This was the second novel swine enteric coronavirus detected in the US since May 2013. In this study, we conducted retrospective testing of samples submitted to three veterinary diagnostic laboratories where qualifying biological samples were derived from previously submitted diagnostic case submissions from US commercial swine farms with a clinical history of enteric disease or from cases that had been previously tested for transmissible gastroenteritis virus, PEDV, or rotavirus. Overall, 2286 banked samples were tested from 27 States. Samples were collected in 3 separate years and in 17 different months. Test results revealed 4 positive samples, 3 collected in August 2013 and 1 collected in October 2013. In addition, a case series including 42 operations in 10 States was conducted through administration of a survey. Survey data collected included information on characteristics of swine operations that had experienced PDCoV clinical signs. Special emphasis was placed on obtaining descriptive estimates of biosecurity practices and disease status over time of each operation. Clinical signs of PDCoV were reported to be similar to those of PEDV. The average number of animals on each operation exhibiting clinical signs (morbidity) and the average number of case fatalities was greatest for suckling and weaned pigs. Average operation-level weaned pig morbidity was greatest in the first week of the outbreak while average operation-level suckling pig case fatality was greatest in the second week of the outbreak. The survey included questions regarding biosecurity practices for visitors and operation employees; trucks, equipment and drivers; and feed sources. These questions attempted to identify a likely pathway of introduction of PDCoV onto the operations surveyed.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCluskey, Brian J.; Haley, Charles; Rovira, Albert; Main, Rodger; Zhang, Yan; Barder, Sunny","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7aa75d21b52039ec085cdf2dbaaab5095c9f1924.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114078.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715300398; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715300398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603048/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.10.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Clinical signs of PDCoV","operation employees","experienced PDCoV clinical signs","positive samples","banked samples","average operation-level suckling pig case fatality","Average operation-level weaned pig morbidity","average number of case fatalities","case series","characteristics of swine operations","diagnostic case submissions","average number of animals","qualifying biological samples","retrospective testing of samples","clinical history of enteric disease","US commercial swine farms","operations surveyed","week","Survey data","questions","outbreak","PEDV","United States","novel swine enteric coronavirus","descriptive estimates of biosecurity practices","disease status","weaned pigs","included information","veterinary diagnostic laboratories","equipment","visitors","drivers","trucks","time","likely pathway of introduction","separate years","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","different months","feed sources","rotavirus","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","cases","Test results","Special emphasis","study","addition","administration"],"language":"en"},

Many lncRNAs can be related to immunity and the host response to viral infection, but their specific functions remain largely elusive. The vast majority of lncRNAs are annotated with extremely limited knowledge and tend to be expressed at low levels, making ad hoc experimentation difficult. Changes to lncRNA expression during infection can be systematically profiled using deep sequencing; however, this often produces an intractable number of candidate lncRNAs, leaving no clear path forward. For these reasons, it is especially important to prioritize lncRNAs into high-confidence \u201Chits\u201D by utilizing multiple methodologies. Large scale perturbation studies may be used to screen lncRNAs involved in phenotypes of interest, such as resistance to viral infection. Single cell transcriptome sequencing quantifies cell-type specific lncRNAs that are less abundant in a mixture. When coupled with iterative experimental validations, new computational strategies for efficiently integrating orthogonal high-throughput data will likely be the driver for elucidating the functional role of lncRNAs during viral infection. This review highlights new high-throughput technologies and discusses the potential for integrative computational analysis to streamline the identification of infection-related lncRNAs and unveil novel targets for antiviral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2017-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemler, David J.; Brochu, Hayden N.; Yang, Fang; Harrell, Erin A.; Peng, Xinxia","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27ee6e389b8f87a3545232db8b8fe385f73e5003.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5748604.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines5040037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related lncRNAs","functional role of lncRNAs","viral infection","vast majority of lncRNAs","cell-type specific lncRNAs","identification of infection","intractable number of candidate lncRNAs","high-confidence","orthogonal high-throughput data","new computational strategies","review highlights new high-throughput technologies","Single cell transcriptome sequencing","specific functions","deep sequencing","integrative computational analysis","novel targets","long non-coding RNAs","potential","iterative experimental validations","hits","driver","host response","immunity","past decade","antiviral therapeutics","Large scale perturbation studies","low levels","experimentation difficult","Changes","lncRNA expression","clear path","resistance","multiple methodologies","Research","limited knowledge","phenotypes","reasons","mixture"],"language":"en"},

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) holds promise as a broad-spectrum, therapeutic target because of the conserved nature of the nucleotide-substrate-binding and catalytic sites. Conventional, quantitative, kinetic analysis of antiviral ribonucleotides monitors one or a few incorporation events. Here, we use a high-throughput magnetic tweezers platform to monitor the elongation dynamics of a prototypical RdRp over thousands of nucleotide-addition cycles in the absence and presence of a suite of nucleotide analog inhibitors. We observe multiple RdRp-RNA elongation complexes; only a subset of which are competent for analog utilization. Incorporation of a pyrazine-carboxamide nucleotide analog, T-1106, leads to RdRp backtracking.

There are six known species of HCoV: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV and SARS-HCoV. Although studies have shown evidence of global distribution of HCoVs, there is limited information on their presence and distribution in Kenya. METHODS: HCoV strains that circulated in Kenya were retrospectively diagnosed and molecularly characterized. A total of 417 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained between January 2009 and December 2012 from around Kenya were analyzed by a real time RT-PCR using HCoV-specific primers. HCoV-positive specimens were subsequently inoculated onto monolayers of LL-CMK2 cells. The isolated viruses were characterized by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the partial polymerase (pol) gene. RESULTS: The prevalence of HCoV infection was as follows: out of the 417 specimens, 35 (8.4 %) were positive for HCoV, comprising 10 (2.4 %) HCoV-NL63, 12 (2.9 %) HCoV-OC43, 9 (2.1 %) HCoV-HKU1, and 4 (1 %) HCoV-229E. The Kenyan HCoV strains displayed high sequence homology to the prototypes and contemporaneous strains. Evolution analysis showed that the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 isolates were under purifying selection. Phylogenetic evolutionary analyses confirmed the identities of three HCoV-HKU1, five HCoV-NL63, eight HCoV-OC43 and three HCoV-229E. CONCLUSIONS: There were yearly variations in the prevalence and circulation patterns of individual HCoVs in Kenya. This paper reports on the first molecular characterization of human Coronaviruses in Kenya, which play an important role in causing acute respiratory infections among children.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sipulwa, Lenata A.; Ongus, Juliette R.; Coldren, Rodney L.; Bulimo, Wallace D.","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/525c07cc621b7185fb0d224710d883f523d08ba3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4736488.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0474-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26833249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-HKU1","SARS-HCoV","Kenyan HCoV-OC43","Kenyan HCoV strains","HCoV-NL63 isolates","HCoV-positive specimens","prevalence of HCoV infection","HCoV-specific primers","known species of HCoV","contemporaneous strains","nasopharyngeal specimens","RT-PCR amplification","real time RT-PCR","evidence of global distribution of HCoVs","molecular characterization of human Coronaviruses","acute respiratory infections","circulation patterns of individual HCoVs","common cause of respiratory illnesses","high sequence homology","age groups","considerable morbidity","sequencing","partial polymerase","MERS-CoV","hospitalization","prototypes","important role","identities","yearly variations","limited information","individuals","monolayers of LL","presence","compromised immunity","purifying selection","Phylogenetic evolutionary analyses","CMK2 cells","paper reports","studies","children","RESULTS","Evolution analysis","BACKGROUND","isolated viruses","CONCLUSIONS","total","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Participants with community acquired acute respiratory infection underwent nasal lavage for IL-8 and neutrophil testing, in addition to multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses. Information about symptoms was obtained throughout the duration of the illness episode using the well-validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21). Global symptom severity was calculated by the area under the curve (AUC) plotting duration versus WURSS total. Of the specimens tested, 56% were positively identified for one or more of nine different respiratory viruses. During acute respiratory infection illness, both IL-8 and neutrophils positively correlate with AUC (r(s) = 0.082, P = 0.022; r(s) = 0.080, P = 0.030). IL-8 and neutrophils correlate with nasal symptom severity: runny nose (r = 0.13, P = \u003C0.00001; r = 0.18, P = \u003C0.003), plugged nose (r = 0.045, P = 0.003; r = 0.14, P = 0.058), and sneezing (r = \u22120.02, P = \u003C0.0001; r = \u22120.0055, P = 0.31). Neutrophils correlate with some quality of life measures such as sleeping well (r = 0.15, P = 0.026). Thus, the study demonstrates that IL-8 and neutrophils are correlated with severity of nasal symptoms during acute respiratory infection. Further research is necessary to determine if the concentration of these or other biomarkers can predict the overall duration and severity of acute respiratory infection illness.","publish_time":"2014-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henriquez, Kelsey M.; Hayney, Mary S.; Xie, Yaoguo; Zhang, Zhengjun; Barrett, Bruce","journal":"Journal of Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4df4076259406b040d21524c8fc6f29146fdc0a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ce959dfce0605c25ac5acc75537fcdfacb3f9072.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4348013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132248/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4348013?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.24042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WURSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory infection illness severity","severity of acute respiratory infection illness","nasal neutrophils","nasal symptom severity","severity of nasal symptoms","identification of respiratory viruses","different respiratory viruses","Global symptom severity","illness episode","nasal lavage","inflammatory biomarkers","well-validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey","overall duration","AUC","certain symptoms","runny nose","WURSS total","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","methods","addition","PCR","relationship","neutrophil testing","detection","community","area","Participants","large data set","quality of life measures","curve","interleukin","concentration","sneezing","research","Information","study","specimens"],"language":"en"},

For coronaviruses, these organelles take the form of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) interconnected by a convoluted membrane network. We used electron microscopy to identify murine coronaviruses with mutations in nsp3 and nsp14 that replicated normally while producing only half the normal amount of DMVs under low-temperature growth conditions. Viruses with mutations in nsp5 and nsp16 produced small DMVs but also replicated normally. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed that the most strongly affected of these, the nsp3 mutant, produced more viral RNA than wild-type virus. Competitive growth assays were carried out in both continuous and primary cells to better understand the contribution of DMVs to viral fitness. Surprisingly, several viruses that produced fewer or smaller DMVs showed a higher fitness than wild-type virus at the reduced temperature, suggesting that larger and more numerous DMVs do not necessarily confer a competitive advantage in primary or continuous cell culture. For the first time, this directly demonstrates that replication and organelle formation may be, at least in part, studied separately during infection with positive-stranded RNA virus.","publish_time":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Mulla, Hawaa M.

METHODS From January 9, 2020, to February 26, 2020, totally 56 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT. For 40 patients, follow-up CT scans were obtained. The CT images were evaluated for the number, type and distribution of the opacity, and the affected lung lobes. Furthermore, the initial CT scan and the follow-up CT scans were compared. RESULTS Forty patients (83.6%) had two or more opacities in the lung. Eighteen (32.7%) patients had only ground-glass opacities; twenty-nine patients (52.7%) had ground-glass and consolidative opacities; and eight patients (14.5%) had only consolidation. A total of 43 patients (78.2%) showed two or more lobes involved. The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%). Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved. The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with \u0022white lungs.\u0022 The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance. CONCLUSIONS The common CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple lung opacities, multiple types of the opacity (ground-glass, ground-glass and consolidation, and consolidation alone), and multiple lobes especially the lower lobe involved. Follow-up CT could demonstrate the rapid progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (either in aggravation or absorption). KEY POINTS \u2022 The predominant CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation and, with both lungs, multiple lobes and especially the lower lobe affected. \u2022 CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia progression. \u2022 CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia may not be consistent with the clinical symptoms or the initial RT-PCR test results.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Fangfang; Lou, Jianghua; Xi, Deyan; Bai, Yan; Ma, Gongbao; Zhao, Bin; Liu, Dong; Bao, Guofeng; Lei, Zhidan; Wang, Meiyun","journal":"European radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06920-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","follow-up CT scans","CT findings of COVID","CT images","predominant CT features of COVID","common CT features of COVID","pneumonia progression","initial CT scan","multiple ground-glass opacities","multiple lung opacities","multiple lobes","rapid progression of COVID","assessment of COVID","consolidation","consolidative opacities","multiple types","severe progression","aggravated progression","affected lung lobes","lower lobe","mild-moderate progression","opacity","improvement","peripheral distribution","white lungs","initial RT-PCR test results","chest computed tomography","early diagnosis","crucial role","clinical symptoms","coronavirus disease","number","KEY POINTS","CONCLUSIONS","unchanged radiographic appearance","OBJECTIVE","aggravation","absorption","laboratory","total","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In addition, we further identified 152 potential anti-ALV-J chicken type I ISGs. Among these potential anti-ALV-J ISGs, chicken cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (chCH25H) was selected for further antiviral mechanism studies in chicken embryo fibroblast cell lines (DF1). The gene chCH25H is located on chromosome 6 and clustered in a distinct group with mammals CH25H in the phylogenetic tree. The core promoter region of chCH25H was located within \u221275/\u22121 sequence. We found that chCH25H was induced by chicken IFN-\u03B1 and ALV-J in DF1 cells. The overexpression of chCH25H significantly inhibited ALV-J replication in DF1 cells at 48 h post infection (hpi). In addition, ALV-J replication was significantly enhanced in the chCH25H- knockout DF1 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that chCH25H restricted ALV-J infection through the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), rather than type I and II interferon.

CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was recently identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV(4). The engagement of the MERS-CoV spike protein with CD26 mediates viral attachment to host cells and virus\u2013cell fusion, thereby initiating infection. Here we delineate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and its complex with CD26. Furthermore, binding between the RBD and CD26 is measured using real-time surface plasmon resonance with a dissociation constant of 16.7 nM. The viral RBD is composed of a core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique strand-dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes blades IV and V of the CD26 \u03B2-propeller. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal a surprising protein\u2013protein contact mediated mainly by hydrophilic residues. Sequence alignment indicates, among betacoronaviruses, a possible structural conservation for the region homologous to the MERS-CoV RBD core, but a high variation in the external receptor binding motif region for virus-specific pathogenesis such as receptor recognition.

As a key and effective measure, pretravel education should be strengthened for all migrant workers and tourists in China, and border screening, cross-border international cooperation, and early warning should be further improved.","publish_time":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yali; Wang, Xuan; Liu, Xiaobo; Ren, Ruiqi; Zhou, Lei; Li, Chao; Tu, Wenxiao; Ni, Daxin; Li, Qun; Feng, Zijian; Zhang, Yanping","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/584aa286fb6e7f2404ff67c5cfa025b33e110214.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6302593.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2501.180178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Africa","Asia"],"keyphrases":["mainland China","cases of infectious disease","National Information Reporting System of Infectious Diseases","border screening","limited information","cross-border international cooperation","demographic","epidemiologic characteristics","serious public health threat","tourists","temporal","pretravel education","key","effective measure","early warning","migrant workers","number of types","spatial distributions","total","data","Africa","Yunnan Province","Asia","study"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the diseases that affect these animals in the wild or in captivity. Kidney samples from necropsies of 27 Iberian lynxes, wild and captive, were examined by histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IgG, IgM, IgA, laminin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin), electron microscopy (n =8) and immunogold labelling for IgM, IgG and IgA in one case, in order to characterize the glomerulopathy prevalent in this species. Urinalyses from records were available for 9 of the necropsied animals and blood and urine samples from 23 free ranging and captive Iberian lynxes were prospectively obtained in order to evaluate the renal function of the living population. A focal, diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) that progressed with age was diagnosed in all but one of the animals in different stages not associated to concurrently known infectious diseases. Positive immunoexpression of IgM and IgG was observed in the glomerular capillary basement membranes and intramembranous electron-dense deposits, compatible with immune complexes (ICs) were seen with electron microscopy. The immunogold labelling was also positive for IgM and IgG in the electron-dense areas. The serum biochemistry and urinalyses also revealed signs of mild chronic kidney disease in 16 of the 23 animals evaluated. In conclusion, the membranous glomerulopathy affecting the Iberian lynx is a progressive disease of immune origin. We postulate a possible genetic predisposition towards the disease, enhanced by inbreeding and a possible connection to an immune-mediated systemic disease.","publish_time":"2008-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jim\u00E9nez, Ma \u00C1ngeles; S\u00E1nchez, Bel\u00E9n; P\u00E9rez Alenza, Ma Dolores; Garc\u00EDa, Pilar; L\u00F3pez, Jose Vicente; Rodriguez, Alejandro; Mu\u00F1oz, \u00C1lvaro; Mart\u00EDnez, Fernando; Vargas, Astrid; Pe\u00F1a, Laura","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6cc1fb438f7fa13b875829e91269c0dae2b2834.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112601.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242707002681; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242707002681","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["IgG","electron microscopy","captive Iberian lynxes","systemic disease","necropsied animals","electron-dense areas","Positive immunoexpression of IgM","progressive disease of immune origin","intramembranous electron-dense deposits","IgA","immune complexes","Kidney samples","order","membranous glomerulopathy","immunogold labelling","Urinalyses","signs of mild chronic kidney disease","urine samples","glomerulopathy prevalent","possible connection","infectious diseases","diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis","endangered felid species","possible genetic predisposition","free ranging","glomerular capillary basement membranes","MGN","fibronectin","collagen","blood","type","ICs","laminin","necropsies","renal function","world","histopathology","immunohistochemistry","southwest of Spain","isolated metapopulations","living population","serum biochemistry","case","different stages","records","conclusion","captivity","individuals"],"language":"en"},

A policy analysis","doi":"10.1186/1475-9276-11-41","pmcid":"PMC3492195","pubmed_id":"22889402","license":"cc-by","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Preventative strategies that focus on addressing the social determinants of health to improve healthy eating and physical activity have become an important strategy in British Columbia and Ontario for combating chronic diseases. What has not yet been examined is the extent to which healthy living initiatives implemented under these new policy frameworks successfully engage with and change the social determinants of health. METHODS: Initiatives active between January 1, 2006 and September 1, 2011 were found using provincial policy documents, web searches, health organization and government websites, and databases of initiatives that attempted to influence to nutrition and physical activity in order to prevent chronic diseases or improve overall health. Initiatives were reviewed, analyzed and grouped using the descriptive codes: lifestyle-based, environment-based or structure-based. Initiatives were also classified according to the mechanism by which they were administered: as direct programs (e.g. directly delivered), blueprints (or frameworks to tailor developed programs), and building blocks (resources to develop programs). RESULTS: 60 initiatives were identified in Ontario and 61 were identified in British Columbia. In British Columbia, 11.5% of initiatives were structure-based. In Ontario, of 60 provincial initiatives identified, 15% were structure-based. Ontario had a higher proportion of direct interventions than British Columbia for all intervention types. However, in both provinces, as the intervention became more upstream and attempted to target the social determinants of health more directly, the level of direct support for the intervention lessened. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of initiatives in British Columbia and Ontario that address healthy eating and active living through action on the social determinants of health is problematic. In the context of Canada\u0027s increasingly neoliberal political and economic policy, the public health sector may face significant barriers to addressing upstream determinants in a meaningful way. If public health cannot directly affect broader societal conditions, interventions should be focused around advocacy and education about the social determinants of health. It is necessary that health be seen for what it is: a political matter. As such, the health sector needs to take a more political approach in finding solutions for health inequities.","publish_time":"2012-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gore, Dana; Kothari, Anita","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ce3ae4141f74a6ef60175581277687d6c185b4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3492195.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-9276-11-41; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22889402/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ontario"],"keyphrases":["social determinants of health","health organization","health inequities","overall health","Initiatives active","provincial initiatives","public health sector","British Columbia","Ontario","databases of initiatives","paucity of initiatives","healthy living initiatives","upstream determinants","direct programs","structure","healthy eating","economic policy","physical activity","provincial policy documents","active living","new policy frameworks","chronic diseases","political approach","political matter","intervention types","developed programs","higher proportion of direct interventions","level of direct support","web searches","action","government websites","significant barriers","important strategy","order","broader societal conditions","context of Canada\u0027s","blocks","solutions","nutrition","advocacy","education","lifestyle","environment","meaningful way","extent","descriptive codes","Preventative strategies","INTRODUCTION","blueprints","resources","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","provinces","RESULTS","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from \u22121.6 to \u221277.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.","publish_time":"1987-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baric, Ralph S.; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/771006c821f2bad4ea3eb592173208e7fb51834e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682287904144; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287904144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leader RNA","RNA polymerase","RNA intermediates","small RNAs","RNA species","recombinant RNAs","partial RNA products","MHV transcription","high frequency of RNA recombination","MHV infection","detection of leader","presence of multiple small leader","regions of secondary structure","pools of free leader","MHV recombinant viruses","mechanism of synthesis","viral polymerase","identical subsets","template","data","various viral genes","nonprocessive mechanism","synthesis of full-length","process of transcription","free energy ranges","functional transcriptional intermediates","mouse hepatitis virus","subset correlates","cDNA probes specific","crossover sites","reproducible sizes","infected cells","primers","origin","biological significance","mol","addition","nucleotides","kcal","mRNAs","paper"],"language":"en"},

Autophagy-related functions include secretion, trafficking of phagocytosed material, replication and egress of viral particles, and regulation of inflammatory and immune signaling cascades. Here, we define common processes dependent on ATGs, and discuss the challenges in mechanistically separating autophagy from these related pathways. Elucidating the molecular events that distinguish how individual ATGs function promises to improve our understanding of the origin of diseases ranging from autoimmunity to cancer.","publish_time":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cadwell, Ken; Debnath, Jayanta","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7748ce96d52eeafe6b08a42b2f9f1774b373f78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5839790.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237720/; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201706157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Autophagy-related functions","separating autophagy","classic autophagy","related pathways","identification of conserved autophagy-related proteins","individual ATGs function","litany of physiological processes","common processes dependent","trafficking of phagocytosed material","bulk degradation of cytosolic material","replication","secretion","egress of viral particles","regulation of inflammatory","foundation","breakthroughs","disease conditions","understanding","origin of diseases","molecular events","autoimmunity","cascades","challenges","cancer","Recent discoveries"],"language":"en"},

Commercial kits that specifically detect avian influenza A (H7N9) virus RNA are urgently required to prepare for the emergence and potential pandemic of this novel influenza virus. The safety and effectiveness of three commercial molecular diagnostic assays were evaluated using a quality-control panel and clinical specimens collected from over 90 patients with confirmed avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infections. The analytical performance evaluation showed that diverse influenza H7N9 viruses can be detected with high within- and between-lot reproducibility and without cross-reactivity to other influenza viruses (H1N1 pdm09, seasonal H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and influenza B). The detection limit of all the commercial assays was 2.83 Log(10) copies/\u03BCl [0.7 Log(10)TCID(50)/mL of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus strain A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013], which is comparable to the method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, using a WHO-Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) method as a reference for clinical evaluation, positive agreement of more than 98% was determined for all of the commercial kits, while negative agreement of more than 99% was observed. In conclusion, our findings provide comprehensive evidence for the high performance of three commercial diagnostic assays and suggest the application of these assays as rapid and effective diagnostic tools for avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in the routine clinical practice of medical laboratories.","publish_time":"2015-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Dawei; Shen, Shu; Fan, Xingliang; Chen, Suhong; Wang, Dayan; Li, Changgui; Wu, Xing; Li, Lili; Bai, Dongting; Zhang, Chuntao; Wang, Junzhi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e8ec294fcc4507fcc89872f84adcf4633bb10e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4567293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26361351/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137862","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","National Influenza Center"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","novel influenza virus","novel avian influenza","influenza B","confirmed avian influenza","diverse influenza H7N9 viruses","commercial assays","H7N9-subtype virus","commercial diagnostic assays","virus strain","virus RNA","virus infections","Commercial kits","Chinese National Influenza Center","commercial molecular diagnostic assays","clinical evaluation","method","clinical specimens","high performance","Log","effective diagnostic tools","analytical performance evaluation","seasonal H1N1","H1N1 pdm09","positive agreement","negative agreement","routine clinical practice of medical laboratories","global public health","World Health Organization","H3N2","CNIC","reference","cross-reactivity","comprehensive evidence","H5N1","Zhejiang","China","effectiveness","potential pandemic","patients","application","quality-control panel","findings","lot reproducibility","conclusion","emergence","DTID-ZJU01","copies","\u03BCl","safety","detection limit","addition","TCID"],"language":"en"},

Thus, due to its rapid action, passive immunisation is often used to treat disease caused by infection and/or toxin exposure. However immunoglobulins may also be administered prior to exposure to infection and/or toxin, although they will not provide long-lasting protection as is seen with active immunisation (vaccination) in which an immunological memory is established by controlled exposure of the host to the pathogen in question. With multi-factorial infectious diseases in production animals, especially those that have proven hard to control by vaccination, the potential of passive immunisation remains big. This review highlights a number of examples on the use of passive immunisation for the control of infectious disease in the modern production of a range of animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, goat, poultry and fish. Special emphasis is given on the enablement of passive immunisation strategies in these production systems through low cost and ease of use as well as on the sources, composition and purity of immunoglobulin preparations used and their benefits as compared to current measures, including vaccination (also comprising maternal vaccination), antibiotics and feed additives such as spray-dried plasma. It is concluded that provided highly efficient, relatively low-price immunoglobulin products are available, passive immunisation has a clear role in the modern animal production sector as a means of controlling infectious diseases, importantly with a very low risk of causing development of bacterial resistance, thus constituting a real and widely applicable alternative to antibiotics.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedegaard, Chris J.; Heegaard, Peter M.H.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6175da18ca315727b067a3f1fb28da6601ff5295.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127230.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242716300642; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242716300642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185263/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.04.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of passive immunisation","potential of passive immunisation","active immunisation","Abstract Immunisation","enablement of passive immunisation strategies","modern production","production animals","infection","production systems","maternal vaccination","toxin exposure","control of infectious disease","modern animal production sector","efficient means","antibiotics","controlled exposure","sources","immunoglobulins","multi-factorial infectious diseases","low cost","low risk","range of animals","ease of use","short-lived protection","long-lasting protection","low-price immunoglobulin products","purity of immunoglobulin preparations","clear role","feed additives","sheep","goat","microbial pathogens","cattle","pigs","disease-causing effects of toxins","development of bacterial resistance","poultry","spray-dried plasma","benefits","host","composition","number of examples","administration of antibodies","immunological memory","fish","applicable alternative","current measures","rapid action","question","Special emphasis","review","years"],"language":"en"},

The disease was first described by Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 from Japan. KD has now been reported from more than 60 countries and is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed countries. Japan reports the highest incidence of KD at 265/100,000 children below 5 years, followed by Korea and Taiwan. In North America and Europe, the incidence of KD is much lower (9\u201325/100,000 children below 5) and appears to have plateaued down over the last few decades. The reasons for these differences in epidemiology are not clearly understood. KD has been increasingly reported from India over the last 20 years. At Chandigarh, an incidence of 4.54/100,000 children below 15 years was reported in 2011. However, this was likely to be an underestimate. The etiology of KD remains unknown. Although a genetic basis of KD seems plausible, an intercurrent infectious process seems to act as a trigger for the inflammatory cascade. Like many other vasculitides, the diagnosis of KD is essentially clinical and is based on a set of criteria first elaborated by Dr. Kawasaki himself. However, several children (especially infants) with KD can have incomplete and atypical presentations. This can result in diagnostic and therapeutic delays. Approximately 15\u201325% children with KD can develop coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) if left untreated. Two dimensional echocardiography remains the gold standard in detecting CAAs in patients with KD. Dual source CT coronary angiography is a recent advance in accurate detection of CAAs with minimal radiation risk. Intravenous immunoglobulin (2g/kg) remains the drug of choice and is administered as an infusion. Other therapeutic agents that have been used include infliximab, cyclosporine, glucocorticoids, and statins. KD has been associated with several long-term sequelae.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Dhrubajyoti; Singh, Surjit","journal":"Indian Journal of Rheumatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05e127c1664c3d01b36c968e28e151fbb7eb05ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288385/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injr.2015.07.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973369815001454; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0973369815001454","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":["Japan","Korea","Taiwan","North America","Europe","India"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of KD","etiology of KD","highest incidence of KD","genetic basis of KD","years","acute self-limiting vasculitis of children","Abstract Kawasaki disease","heart disease","Japan","Tomisaku Kawasaki","accurate detection of CAAs","developed countries","therapeutic delays","therapeutic agents","coronary artery abnormalities","Dual source CT coronary angiography","recent advance","gold standard","minimal radiation risk","commonest cause","intercurrent infectious process","Europe","patients","medium sized arteries","cyclosporine","glucocorticoids","trigger","infliximab","dimensional echocardiography","North America","atypical presentations","infants","drug of choice","reasons","differences","epidemiology","Intravenous immunoglobulin","inflammatory cascade","statins","set of criteria","diagnostic","Korea","Taiwan","vasculitides","Chandigarh","India","long-term sequelae","underestimate","infusion","decades"],"language":"en"},

Design A retrospective observational study. Setting Two medical centers in Taiwan. Patients Forty-four patients with SARS who received ribavirin and 7 patients with SARS who did not receive ribavirin. Measurements and results The mean peak C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in SARS patients who were receiving ribavirin therapy than in SARS patients who were not receiving ribavirin therapy. The mortality was also higher, but the difference was not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, hemoglobin level was an independent prognostic correlate of hypoxemia or mortality (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.8; p = 0.03). The hemoglobin began decreasing in two thirds of SARS patients (32 of 44 patients; 73%) who were receiving ribavirin 3 days after therapy with the antiviral drug was started. Patients with a drop in hemoglobin level of \u003E 2 g/dL had a significantly higher mortality rate than the other patients. Hypoxemia developed in one third of SARS patients (17 of 44 patients; 39%) who were receiving ribavirin, all of whom were anemic. Of the 17 hypoxemic patients, 11 (65%) had a drop in hemoglobin of \u003E 2 g/dL, and 4 patients (24%) required a blood transfusion. The mean slope of the hemoglobin decrease was significantly steeper (p = 0.001) in hypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin than in the nonhypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin. Only one of seven SARS patients (14%) who was not receiving ribavirin became anemic, but this individual was not hypoxemic. Eventually, 5 of 17 hypoxemic and anemic SARS patients (29%) who were receiving ribavirin died. The combination of hypoxia with anemia was thus significantly associated with a higher mortality (p \u003C 0.001). Conclusions Hypoxia combined with anemia increased the risk for death in SARS patients. Unless ribavirin can be shown to be effective against SARS-coronavirus, the risk of anemia posed by this drug argues against its use in SARS patients.","publish_time":"2005-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiou, Hsueh-Erh; Liu, Ching-Lung; Buttrey, Mary Jeanne; Kuo, Han-Pin; Liu, Hui-Wen; Kuo, Hsu-Tah; Lu, Yen-Ta","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6eac289583e5f97d29d5da13e2b45e6e34f0ef0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094379.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215379563; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215379563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anemic SARS patients","thirds of SARS patients","nonhypoxemic patients","SARS-coronavirus","ribavirin therapy","effect of ribavirin","hemoglobin level","risk of anemia","hemoglobin decrease","higher mortality rate","induced anemia","drop","mean slope","antiviral drug","Study objectives","combination of hypoxia","Conclusions Hypoxia","retrospective observational study","independent prognostic correlate of hypoxemia","mean peak C-reactive protein","lactate dehydrogenase levels","outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome","odds ratio","days","death","multivariate analysis","Measurements","individual","use","medical centers","Taiwan","confidence interval","difference","blood transfusion"],"language":"en"},

These results indicated that MW irradiation released endotoxins from cells into the atmosphere.

Polymorphisms at OAS1 have been shown to correlate with differential susceptibility to several infections of great public health significance, including hepatitis C virus, SARS coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Population genetics analyses in hominoids have revealed interesting evolutionary patterns. In Central African chimpanzee, OAS1 has evolved under long-term balancing selection, resulting in the persistence of polymorphisms since the origin of hominoids, whereas human populations have acquired and retained OAS1 alleles from Neanderthal and Denisovan origin. We decided to further investigate the evolution of OAS1 in primates by characterizing intra-specific variation in four species commonly used as models in infectious disease research: the rhesus macaque, the cynomolgus macaque, the olive baboon, and the Guinea baboon. In baboons, OAS1 harbors a very low level of variation. In contrast, OAS1 in macaques exhibits a level of polymorphism far greater than the genomic average, which is consistent with the action of balancing selection. The region of the enzyme that directly interacts with viral RNA, the RNA-binding domain, contains a number of polymorphisms likely to affect the RNA-binding affinity of OAS1. This strongly suggests that pathogen-driven balancing selection acting on the RNA-binding domain of OAS1 is maintaining variation at this locus. Interestingly, we found that a number of polymorphisms involved in RNA-binding were shared between macaques and chimpanzees. This represents an unusual case of convergent polymorphism.","publish_time":"2015-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fish, Ian; Boissinot, St\u00E9phane","journal":"Immunogenetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66728b25fef4188e4e8f88a0480ba9db49001b17.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0757f72f342223d672e7ce68264126709bec610b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4809017.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00251-015-0855-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156123/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guinea"],"keyphrases":["RNA-binding domain of OAS1","OAS1 alleles","evolution of OAS1","RNA-binding affinity of OAS1","viral RNA","persistence of polymorphisms","long-term balancing selection","action of balancing selection","number of polymorphisms likely","origin of hominoids","level of polymorphism","low level of variation","macaques","intra-specific variation","rhesus macaque","cynomolgus macaque","enzyme acts","olive baboon","Denisovan origin","Guinea baboon","hepatitis C virus","West Nile virus","innate sensor of viral infection","unusual case of convergent polymorphism","SARS coronavirus","infections of great public health significance","infectious disease research","defense","species","primates","major role","human populations","models","Population genetics analyses","interesting evolutionary patterns","genomic average","Neanderthal","differential susceptibility","wide diversity of viruses","oligoadenylate synthetase","Central African chimpanzee","baboons","chimpanzees","pathogen","contrast","locus","region"],"language":"en"},

The first occurred several weeks after PCV\u2010negative animals were moved under quarantine from the nursery into an animal holding room. The apparent origin of PCV was newly installed stainless steel penning, which was not sufficiently degreased thereby protecting viral particles from disinfection. The second outbreak was apparently transmitted via employee activities in the Caesarian\u2010section suite adjacent to the barrier facility. In both cases, PCV was contained in the animal holding room where it was diagnosed making a complete facility depopulation\u2010repopulation unnecessary. METHOD: Infectious PCV was eliminated during both outbreaks by the following: euthanizing infected animals, disposing of all removable items from the affected animal holding room, extensive cleaning with detergents and degreasing agents, sterilization of equipment and rooms with chlorine dioxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and potassium peroxymonosulfate, and for the second outbreak also glutaraldehyde/quaternary ammonium. Impact on other barrier animals throughout the process was monitored by frequent PCV diagnostic testing. RESULT: After close monitoring for 6 months indicating PCV absence from all rooms and animals, herd animals were removed from quarantine status. CONCLUSION: Ten years after PCV clearance following the second outbreak, due to strict adherence to biosecurity protocols and based on ongoing sentinel diagnostic monitoring (currently monthly), the herd remains DPF including PCV negative.","publish_time":"2018-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noordergraaf, Jeske; Schucker, Adrienne; Martin, Mike; Schuurman, Henk\u2010jan; Ordway, Brianne; Cooley, Kevin; Sheffler, Marie; Theis, Kara; Armstrong, Chasa; Klein, Laura; Hansen, Doug; Olson, Megan; Schlechter, Lisa; Spizzo, Tom","journal":"Xenotransplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9d779b07799a189fb48a72daab15618e021fa6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169735.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30264879/; https://doi.org/10.1111/xen.12428","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPF","SAF","PCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV negative","PCV absence","PCV clearance","Infectious PCV","outbreaks of PCV infection","barrier animals","apparent origin of PCV","frequent PCV diagnostic testing","herd animals","negative animals","barrier facility","DPF status","infected animals","affected animal","quarantine status","Source Animal","rooms","health status","CDCD piglets","Caesarian","complete facility depopulation","sentinel testing","cases","following","ongoing sentinel diagnostic monitoring","designated pathogen","close monitoring","time of SAF population","extensive cleaning","vaporized hydrogen peroxide","negativity","degreasing agents","chlorine dioxide","cells","sterilization of equipment","detergents","section suite adjacent","biosecurity protocols","US commercial swine production industry","tissues","cohorts","pigs","SPF","months","removable items","porcine circovirus","process","donors of viable organs","installed stainless steel penning","potassium peroxymonosulfate","employee activities","xenotransplantation","strict adherence","repopulation unnecessary","colostrum","sows of conventional","clinical patients","glutaraldehyde","quaternary ammonium","CONCLUSION","years","nursery","weeks","viral particles","disinfection","month period","RESULT","BACKGROUND","METHOD","Impact"],"language":"en"},

The expectations of the public may outstrip hospital plans and abilities to provide nonmedical assistance. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the public expectations of the hospital during disasters regarding resource provision. METHODS: A survey was distributed to adult patients or family members at three emergency departments (EDs). Respondents were asked to evaluate hospital responsibility to provide nine resources to those without emergency medical needs, including vaccination, medication refill or replacement, food and water, grief/stress counseling, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) access assistance, short/long-term shelter, family reunification, and hospital. Additionally, respondents answered questions regarding prior disaster experience and demographics. RESULTS: There were 961 respondents (66.9% were female, 47.5% were white, and 44.6% were black). Respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the hospital should provide the following services: event-specific vaccination (84%), medication refill/replacement (76.5%), food and water (61%), grief or stress counseling (53%), FEMA access assistance (52%), short-term shelter (51%), family reunification (50%), long-term shelter (38%), and hospital transportation (29%). Those 36\u201345 years of age were less likely to expect services (p \u003C 0.05) and non-whites and those with a family member with a medical condition requiring electricity were more likely to expect services (p \u003C 0.001 and p \u003C 0.05, respectively). There were no differences based on frequency of ED use, sex, income, or prior disaster experience. CONCLUSION: There is a high public expectation that hospitals will provide significant nonmedical disaster relief. Understanding these expectations is essential to appropriate community disaster planning.","publish_time":"2013-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charney, Rachel L.; Rebmann, Terri; Esguerra, Cybill R.; Lai, Charlene W.; Dalawari, Preeti","journal":"J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bac63e7a8d92754d8c4c9c01b7a8cd67d4f2c9dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23845529/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467913005064; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2013.05.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467913005064","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FEMA","Federal Emergency Management Agency"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital plans","hospital responsibility","hospital transportation","Respondents","public expectations","emergency medical needs","family reunification","prior disaster experience","emergency departments","nonmedical assistance","family members","long-term shelter","FEMA access assistance","stress counseling","grief","replacement","significant nonmedical disaster relief","following services","medical condition","high public expectation","medication refill","appropriate community disaster","food","water","short-term shelter","OBJECTIVE","Federal Emergency Management Agency","manmade disasters","event-specific vaccination","hospitals","sex","income","electricity","resources","abilities","frequency of ED use","adult patients","central rallying","care site","questions","survey","differences","BACKGROUND","demographics","non-whites","resource provision","years of age","female","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The influenza virus infects both humans and birds, and mutates using two mechanisms: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Currently, the H5N1 avian flu virus is limited to outbreaks among poultry and persons in direct contact to infected poultry, but the mortality rate among infected humans is high. Avian influenza (AI) is endemic in Asia as a result of unregulated poultry rearing in rural areas. Such birds often live in close proximity to humans and this increases the chance of genetic re-assortment between avian and human influenza viruses which may produce a mutant strain that is easily transmitted between humans. Once this happens, a global pandemic is likely. Unlike SARS, a person with influenza infection is contagious before the onset of case-defining symptoms which limits the effectiveness of case isolation as a control strategy. Researchers have shown that carefully orchestrated of public health measures could potentially limit the spread of an AI pandemic if implemented soon after the first cases appear. To successfully contain and control an AI pandemic, both national and global strategies are needed. National strategies include source surveillance and control, adequate stockpiles of anti-viral agents, timely production of flu vaccines and healthcare system readiness. Global strategies such as early integrated response, curbing the disease outbreak at source, utilization of global resources, continuing research and open communication are also critical.","publish_time":"2008-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koh, GCH; Wong, TY; Cheong, SK; Koh, DSQ","journal":"Asia Pac Fam Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbcfed5be85b5356dd0d103c8b6ab37296035cf5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2588555.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1447-056x-7-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014538/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["Avian influenza","global pandemic","flu pandemic","global strategies","AI pandemic","influenza infection","influenza pandemics","infected humans","infected poultry","National strategies","human influenza viruses","H5N1 avian flu virus","utilization of global resources","control strategy","birds","result of unregulated poultry","timely production of flu vaccines","source surveillance","onset of case","antigenic drift","antigenic shift","highest mortality rates","effectiveness of case isolation","adequate stockpiles of anti-viral agents","continuing research","persons","outbreaks","chance of genetic re-assortment","open communication","disease outbreak","direct contact","healthcare system readiness","mechanisms","Asia","integrated response","symptoms","spread","rural areas","mutant strain","SARS","close proximity","public health measures","Researchers","cases"],"language":"en"},

The map resolves the extensive glycan shield obstructing the protein surface and, in combination with mass-spectrometry, provides a structural framework to understand accessibility to antibodies. The structure also reveals a remarkable modular architecture of the receptor-binding subunit and the complete architecture of the fusion machinery including the triggering loop and the C-terminal domains, which contribute to anchoring the trimer to the viral membrane. Our data further suggest that HCoV-NL63 and other coronaviruses use molecular trickery, based on masking of epitopes with glycans and activating conformational changes, to evade the immune system of infected hosts.","publish_time":"2016-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walls, Alexandra C.; Tortorici, M.

Since the proportion of snakes in bushmeat gradually increases, human pentastomiasis is an emerging zoonotic disease. To substantiate the significance of this threat, we surveyed snakes offered for human consumption at bushmeat markets in the Kole district, Democratic Republic of the Congo, for the presence of adult pentastomids. In Bitis vipers (n = 40), Armillifer spp. infestations exhibited an 87.5% prevalence and 6.0 median intensity. Parasite abundance covaried positively with viper length, but not with body mass. In pythons (n = 13), Armillifer spp. exhibited a 92.3% prevalence and 3.5 median intensity. The positive correlations between parasite abundance and python length or mass were statistically nonsignificant. Ninety-one percent of A. grandis were discovered in vipers and 97% of infected vipers hosted A. grandis, whereas 81% of A. armillatus specimens were found in pythons and 63% of infected pythons hosted A. armillatus.

This study aims to understand barriers and motivators behind older adult\u2019s decision on influenza vaccination. Methods Face to face interviews with participants aged 65 and above were conducted and audio recorded in Geylang polyclinic in Singapore. Thematic content analysis was used to organise the data. Results 15 older adults were interviewed, aged between 66 and 85 years old. 6 were vaccine refusers, 3 defaulters and 6 acceptors. A perceived lack of vulnerability, fear of side effects, and trivialisation of influenza were common reasons for not taking the vaccine. Encouragement from family and friends, travel and previous positive vaccination experiences were motivators for getting vaccinated. Healthcare workers played a role in influencing many of the participants\u2019 decision-making. Common misconceptions included vaccines considered as necessary only before travel and as a cure rather than prevention. Most participants exhibited ambivalence, giving reasons both for and against vaccine uptake. Discussion Most older adults do not perceive influenza as a potentially serious disease nor trust in influenza vaccines\u2019 efficacy. Misconceptions played a significant role in vaccine decline. Novel findings include the importance of the family unit in decision making, prioritization of chronic health problems over vaccination and misconception that vaccines are only needed when travelling out of country.

Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may help clinicians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Guoping; He, Xiang; Zhang, Lei; Ran, Qin; Wang, Junyi; Xiong, Anying; Wu, Dehong; Chen, Feng; Sun, Jinlyu; Chang, Christopher","journal":"J Autoimmun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbcd236d80bd22184d7a79b6df168a72704572b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152872.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303424/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841120300792; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841120300792; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 expression","role of ACE2","Analysis of ACE2","elevated expression of ACE2","expression level of ACE2","SARS-CoV infected cells","SARS-CoA","pathogenesis of SARS","COVID","viral activity","cytokine secretion","receptor","underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility","post-infection regulation","viral genome replication","post-infection modulation","Protein-protein interaction","underlying diseases","human cells","hub genes","immune response","various conditions","PPI","networks","healthy populations","cigarette smokers","uploaded information","patients","long-term smoking","way similar","design therapeutic strategies","researchers","risk factor","insight","entry","clinicians","distribution","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

A microbial agent is only identified in 15\u201330% of the fever episodes and corresponds mostly to bacterial findings. Objective To investigate viral infections as possible etiologic agents in episodes of febrile neutropenia. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from patients presenting with neutropenic fever at two pediatric oncology wards in Sweden and Australia were analyzed with a conventional virus-diagnostic approach and RT-PCR. Coupled blood samples were analyzed for the detection of CMV, EBV, adenovirus and erythrovirus. Bacterial blood culture was performed routinely. Results Conventional virus-diagnostic approach coupled to routinely performed bacterial analyzes revealed an infectious agent in 29% compared to 60% when using PCR. By adding PCR, a viral pathogen was detected in 46% of the NPAs and in 4% of the blood samples collected. In half of the patients with bacteremia, respiratory tract viruses were co-detected. Conclusion Respiratory viruses were frequently detected in NPAs suggesting a significant role of viral infections in children presenting with neutropenic fever. The meaning of these findings needs to be further evaluated but has the potential to individualize infection treatment and to reduce the extensive use of antibiotics in immunocompromised children with neutropenia.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindblom, Anna; Bhadri, Vivek; S\u00F6derh\u00E4ll, Stefan; \u00D6hrmalm, Lars; Wong, Michelle; Norbeck, Oscar; Lindau, Cecilia; Rotz\u00E9n-\u00D6stlund, Maria; Allander, Tobias; Catchpoole, Daniel; Dalla-Pozza, Luciano; Broliden, Kristina; Tolfvenstam, Thomas","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcb7d17ab5dec43f073463e428f77489c68ef3b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108298.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.11.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20056482/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209005678; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209005678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Sweden","Australia"],"keyphrases":["NPAs","neutropenic fever","fever episodes","bacterial findings","blood samples","episodes of febrile neutropenia","Bacterial blood culture","immunocompromised children","patients","conventional virus-diagnostic approach","viral pathogen","RT-PCR","significant role of viral infections","Abstract Background Febrile neutropenia","respiratory tract viruses","Conclusion Respiratory viruses","infectious agent","microbial agent","common complication","possible etiologic agents","Australia","pediatric oncology wards","bacteremia","extensive use of antibiotics","detection of CMV","Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates","EBV","adenovirus","Sweden","chemotherapy","infection treatment","erythrovirus","malignancies","Objective","potential","half","meaning"],"language":"en"},

Increasing demand coupled with limited resources in a publicly funded system (e.g. Ontario, the largest province in Canada) resulted in a waitlist for this procedure. Our province has recommended maximum wait times (RMWT) for patients referred to CATH. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience over the past decade in attempting to meet RMWTs for patients needing CATH at our centre, and to discuss issues concerning capacity planning in providing timely service. Methods We measured the proportion of patients undergoing a procedure within the RWMT, and calculated both the mean number of patients and mean length of time on the wait list for each year over a decade for those referred to CATH using prospectively collected registry data. We identified factors that increased referrals or improved capacity. Wait time was compared to community standard RMWTs in order to establish if and how RMWTs were achieved. Results Despite a number of systematic and capacity improvements, RMWTs were not achieved until after the addition of a 4th laboratory. Interpretation Improving access to CATH in our centre was reactive to the increasing need of the community rather than based on anticipation of need and continuity of service within RMWTs. Registry data can help monitor key indicators (e.g. RMWT). Prudent use of this information should help policy makers with future expansion in our region.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mercuri, Mat; Natarajan, Madhu K.; Holder, Douglas H.; Xie, Changchun; Gafni, Amiram","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/107c18d15d6d233fafa94e71a6de61ce53f0a595.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19223088/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851009000219; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2009.01.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851009000219","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CATH"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["mean number of patients","community standard RMWTs","proportion of patients","centre","capacity planning","capacity improvements","wait list","improved capacity","increasing need","registry data","procedure","mean length of time","maximum wait times","key indicators","number of systematic","anticipation of need","timely service","continuity of service","largest province","past decade","diagnosis","information","policy makers","Ontario","funded system","future expansion","Abstract Background Cardiac catheterization","management of coronary artery disease","limited resources","Canada","issues","order","region","experience","factors","referrals","year","access","RWMT","Prudent use","study","demand","waitlist","Results","purpose","Interpretation","Methods","addition","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

The drift flux model, which considers the settling of particles or droplets under the effect of gravitational sedimentation, is adopted to simulate the droplets transport and distribution indoors during respiration and sneezing or coughing process, while the simplified model for solving the continuous fluid flow is combined. Two different cases considering the normal respiration and coughing or sneezing are studied, respectively, and two different outlet velocities from the mouth for the sneezing or coughing process are considered.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have uncovered a wealth of information about the relationship between the sequences and efficacies of anti-HIV-1 antibodies through a combination of bioinformatics, structural characterization and in vivo studies. This knowledge has stimulated efforts to enhance antibody breadth and potency for therapeutic use. Although some engineered antibodies have shown increased polyreactivity and short half-lives, promising efforts are circumventing these problems. SUMMARY: Antibodies are desirable as therapeutics due to their ability to recognize targets with both specificity and high affinity. Furthermore, the ability of antibodies to stimulate Fc-mediated effector functions can increase their utility. Thus, mAbs have become central to strategies for the treatment of various diseases. Using both targeted and library-based approaches, antibodies can be engineered to improve their therapeutic properties. This article will discuss recent antibody engineering efforts to improve the breadth and potency of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. The polyreactivity of engineered HIV-1 bNAbs and the effect on serum half-life will be explored along with strategies to overcome problems introduced by engineering antibodies. Finally, advances in creating bispecific anti-HIV-1 reagents are discussed.","publish_time":"2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sievers, Stuart A.; Scharf, Louise; West, Anthony P.; Bjorkman, Pamela J.","journal":"Curr Opin HIV AIDS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8977825a7fbaa1e4d672a361e7122b48785f93dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4465343.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25760931/; https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000148","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["engineering antibodies","ability of antibodies","polyreactivity of engineered HIV","serum half-lives of engineered antibodies","potency of anti-HIV","recent antibody engineering efforts","efficacies of anti-HIV","bispecific anti-HIV","Recent studies","antibody breadth","RECENT FINDINGS","effects of increased polyreactivity","promising efforts","review highlights recent developments","strategies","problems","short half-lives","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","serum half-life","therapeutic use","therapeutic properties","bNAbs","sequences","combination of bioinformatics","Fc-mediated effector functions","relationship","targets","specificity","structural characterization","wealth of information","library-based approaches","therapeutics","article","treatment of various diseases","high affinity","utility","SUMMARY","advances","reagents","mAbs","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

We have collected a total of 26 patients with COVID-19 who required extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). The available data from the first 14 cases demonstrated that the median age of patients was 71 and the median PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, and lung compliance were 70, 15 cmH(2)O, 21 cmH(2)O, and 28 mL/cmH(2)O, respectively. Median serum KL-6 level was 333 U/mL. Consequently, 16 (62%) out of the 26 have been weaned off and 6 (26%) have been extubated and on rehabilitation, while the other 10 (38%) remain on ECMO. There seemed to be two phenotypes of COVID-19: one with impaired lung compliance and one with preserved lung compliance. The latter phenotype was likely to be favored from the use of ECMO. Further investigation is necessary to clasrify the optimal use of ECMO in patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b094e82cbe9016eeab5eb95fad1141e6eaa25b36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7180634.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40560-020-00445-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341785/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cmH","phenotypes of COVID","preserved lung compliance","impaired lung compliance","median age of patients","optimal use of ECMO","median PaO","Median serum","mean airway pressure","positive end-expiratory pressure","ratio","cases","FIO","extracorporeal membranous oxygenation","level","novel coronavirus disease","available data","investigation","total","Japan","rehabilitation"],"language":"en"},

The etiologic agents are Vibrio spp. that carry Photorhabdus Insect-Related (Pir) toxin genes pirA and pirB. A multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR was developed that detects pirA, pirB, and two internal control genes, the shrimp 18S rRNA and the bacterial 16S rRNA genes in a single reaction. The pirB primers amplify the 3\u0027-end of the pirB gene allowing the detection of Vibrio spp. mutants that contain a complete deletion of pirA and the partial deletion of pirB. The assay also detects mutants that contain the entire pirA gene and the deletion of the pirB gene. Since both toxin genes are needed for disease development, this assays can distinguish between pathogenic strains of Vibrio spp. that cause AHPND in shrimp and mutants that do not cause disease. The amplicons for pirA, pirB, 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA showed easily distinguishable melting temperatures of 78.21 \u00B1 0.18, 75.20 \u00B1 0.20, 82.28 \u00B1 0.34 and 85.41 \u00B1 0.21 \u00B0C respectively. Additionally, a duplex real-time PCR assay was carried out by designing TaqMan probes for the pirA and pirB primers. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was compared between the SYBR Green and TaqMan assays. Both assays showed similar sensitivity with a limit of detection being 10 copies for pirA and pirB, and neither assays showed any cross reaction with other known bacterial and viral pathogens in shrimp. The high sensitivity of both assays make them suitable for the detection of low copies of the pirA and pirB genes in AHPND causing Vibrio spp. as well as for detecting non-pathogenic mutants.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz-Flores, Roberto; Mai, Hung Nam; Dhar, Arun K.","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2e653d48d4c3eb2197f86102e2b5f301b26af38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127373.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2018.12.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576786/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089085081830286X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089085081830286X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vibrio","SYBR Green"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pirB genes","pirB primers","toxin genes pirA","partial deletion of pirB","S rRNA genes","complete deletion of pirA","entire pirA gene","detection of Vibrio","TaqMan assays","AHPND","shrimp aquaculture","disease development","lethal disease","non-pathogenic mutants","internal control genes","detection of low copies","limit of detection","pathogenic strains of Vibrio","similar sensitivity","diagnostic sensitivity","high sensitivity","multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR","Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease","duplex real-time PCR assay","cross reaction","single reaction","TaqMan probes","major economic losses","Photorhabdus Insect-Related","viral pathogens","specificity","distinguishable melting temperatures","Early mortality syndrome","EMS","end","etiologic agents","amplicons"],"language":"en"},

The exact route of virus entry into the blood and CNS invasion has not been clearly defined. The present study was undertaken to assess the population in PBMC that supports the growth of virus and to detect active virus replication in PBMC as well as its subsets. METHODS: PBMC subsets viz.: CD3(\u002B), CD14(\u002B), CD19(\u002B), CD56(\u002B)cells were separated and infected with CHPV. The infected cells were then assessed for transcription (N gene primer) and replication (NP gene primer) of CHPV by PCR. The supernatant collected from infected cells were titrated in Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells to assess virus release. The cytokine and chemokine expression was quantified by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Amplification of N and NP gene was detected in CD14(\u002B) (monocyte) and CD19(\u002B) (B cell), significant increase in virus titre was also observed in these subsets. It was observed that, although the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated in CD14(\u002B) cells as compared to CD19(\u002B)cells, the differences were not significant. However the levels of TNF\u03B1 and IL-8 were significantly elevated in CD14(\u002B) cells than in CD19(\u002B)cells. The levels of chemokine (CXCL9, CCL5, CCL2, CXCL10) were significantly elevated in CHPV infected PBMC as compared to uninfected cells. CCL2 and CXCL9 were significantly increased in CHPV infected CD14(\u002B)cells as compared to CD19(\u002B) cells. CONCLUSION: CD14(\u002B)and CD19(\u002B)cells support active replication of CHPV. High viral load was detected in CD14(\u002B) cells infected with CHPV hence it might be the primary target cells for active replication of CHPV. An elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines observed in CD14(\u002B) cells may help in predicting the pathogenecity of CHPV and possible entry into the central nervous system.","publish_time":"2016-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Soumen; Pavitrakar, Daya; Gunjikar, Rashmi; Ayachit, Vijay M.; Bondre, Vijay P.; Sapkal, Gajanan N.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acb8ae819eaf658a9e9704220f1e987a0365675e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5024506.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27628855/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1794-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","PBMC","CHPV","NP","Baby Hamster Kidney"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["uninfected cells","CHPV infected CD14","CHPV infected PBMC","CD19","primary target cells","active replication of CHPV","pathogenecity of CHPV","active virus replication","Chandipura virus","virus titre","growth of virus","virus release","PBMC subsets","levels of IL","levels of chemokine","elevated levels of cytokines","exact route of virus entry","levels of TNF\u03B1","NP gene primer","N gene primer","CXCL9","CCL2","possible entry","immune system","chemokine expression","significant increase","Amplification of N","central nervous system","BHK","Baby Hamster Kidney","different stages","blood","Interaction","CCL5","transcription","B cell","CXCL10","CD3","chemokines","CNS invasion","life cycle","flow cytometry","BACKGROUND","population","RESULTS","High viral load","METHODS","PCR","differences","monocyte","CD56","supernatant","present study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Key findings Re-organization of radiographic manpower, patient segregation, and modification of routine radiographic practices are key measures to help radiographic services deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, emphasis on deploying more mobile radiographic units, segregating equipment, developing consistent image acquisition workflows, and strict adherence to infection control protocols are paramount to minimize the possibility of in-hospital transmission and ensure a safe environment for both patients and staff. Streamlining communication channels between leadership and ground staff allows quick dissemination of information to ultimately facilitate safe provision of services. Conclusion COVID-19 has drastically altered the way general radiography teams provide services. The institution of several key measures will allow hospitals to safely and sustainably provide radiographic services. To date, there have been zero incidences of radiographer healthcare worker transmission within our institution during the course of work. Implication for practice Radiographers are facing the challenge of providing high-quality services while simultaneously minimizing pathogen exposure to staff and patients.

The growing global concern regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has encouraged research into the development of nutritional and feeding strategies as well as vaccination protocols in order to counteract the PWD due to ETEC. A valid approach to researching effective strategies is to implement piglet in vivo challenge models with ETEC infection. Thus, the proper application and standardization of ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models represent an urgent priority. The current review provides an overview regarding the current piglet ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models; it highlights the key points for setting the challenge protocols and the most important indicators which should be included in research studies to verify the effectiveness of the ETEC challenge. Based on the current review, it is recommended that the setting of the model correctly assesses the choice and preconditioning of pigs, and the timing and dosage of the ETEC inoculation. Furthermore, the evaluation of the ETEC challenge response should include both clinical parameters (such as the occurrence of diarrhea, rectal temperature and bacterial fecal shedding) and biomarkers for the specific expression of ETEC F4/F18 (such as antibody production, specific F4/F18 immunoglobulins (Igs), ETEC F4/F18 fecal enumeration and analysis of the F4/F18 receptors expression in the intestinal brush borders). On the basis of the review, the piglets\u2019 response upon F4 or F18 inoculation differed in terms of the timing and intensity of the diarrhea development, on ETEC fecal shedding and in the piglets\u2019 immunological antibody response. This information was considered to be relevant to correctly define the experimental protocol, the data recording and the sample collections. Appropriate challenge settings and evaluation of the response parameters will allow future research studies to comply with the replacement, reduction and refinement (3R) approach, and to be able to evaluate the efficiency of a given feeding, nutritional or vaccination intervention in order to combat ETEC infection.","publish_time":"2019-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luise, Diana; Lauridsen, Charlotte; Bosi, Paolo; Trevisi, Paolo","journal":"J Anim Sci Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc4cba8699fe81e72f1b678d95dc054189e67cab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6567477.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40104-019-0352-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31210932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":["AMR","PWD","ETEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ETEC challenge response","standardization of ETEC F4","ETEC inoculation","ETEC infection","current piglet ETEC F4","F18 challenge models","specific expression of ETEC F4","ETEC fecal shedding","specific F4","F18 inoculation","F18 immunoglobulins","F18 fimbriae","challenge protocols","F18 fecal enumeration","F18 receptors expression","piglets\u2019 response","response parameters","Appropriate challenge settings","current review","diarrhea development","piglets\u2019 immunological antibody response","bacterial fecal shedding","occurrence of diarrhea","timing","vaccination protocols","development of nutritional","evaluation","future research studies","PWD","post-weaning diarrhea","vaccination intervention","antibody production","clinical parameters","effective strategies","given feeding","valid approach","analysis","rectal temperature","main pathogens","biomarkers","overview","antimicrobial resistance","data recording","AMR","growing global concern","terms","intestinal brush borders","key points","experimental protocol","refinement","efficiency","replacement","intensity","dosage","proper application","urgent priority","effectiveness","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","important indicators","reduction","sample collections","pigs","choice","basis","information"],"language":"en"},

This study tested whether well-known chemicals used as RNA virus treatment agents had inhibitory effects on FMD viruses (FMDVs) and demonstrated that ribavirin showed antiviral effects against FMDV in vitro/in vivo. In addition, it was observed that combining the administration of the antiviral agents orally and complementary therapy with vaccines synergistically enhanced antiviral activity and preserved the survival rate and body weight in the experimental animals. Antiviral agents mixed with an adjuvant were inoculated intramuscularly along with the vaccines, thereby inhibiting virus replication after injection and verifying that it was possible to induce early protection against viral infection prior to immunity being achieved through the vaccine. Finally, pigs treated with antiviral agents and vaccines showed no clinical signs and had low virus excretion. Based on these results, it is expected that this combined approach could be a therapeutic and preventive treatment for early protection against FMD.","publish_time":"2018-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Joo-Hyung; Jeong, Kwiwan; Kim, Su-Mi; Ko, Mi-Kyeong; You, Su-Hwa; Lyoo, Young S.; Kim, Byounghan; Ku, Jin-Mo; Park, Jong-Hyeon","journal":"J Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4476687d4a23df5d5428626f81d9621abf94e679.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6265586.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30304889/; https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2018.19.6.788","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMD","FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral agents","antiviral effects","vaccines","antiviral activity","early protection","RNA virus treatment agents","FMD viruses","virus replication","low virus excretion","inhibitory effects","preventive treatment","clinical signs","survival rate","well-known chemicals","complementary therapy","body weight","immunity","FMDVs","vaccination","research","viral infection","ribavirin","development","experimental animals","mouth disease","prevention of foot","injection","pigs","combined approach","study","immunological competence","administration","adjuvant","countries","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

Data for children (aged \u003C15 years) identified with traumatic injuries during a 10-year period from the Korean National Health Insurance Sharing Service (n = 35,064 among 10,114,909 randomly sampled cases from the claim records of the National Health Insurance) and the authors\u0027 institute (n = 39,228) were retrospectively reviewed. The incidences and characteristics of the injuries were investigated using both datasets; additionally, detailed information regarding the injury environments was investigated using the single-institutional data. The findings were similar across both datasets. The incidence of injuries increased during the study period; the head was most commonly injured, whereas the trunk or proximal extremities were rarely injured; low-energy head injuries accounted for \u003E50% of the cases in children aged \u003C5 years, although the incidences of lower-extremity injuries and fractures increased in older children. Single-institutional data demonstrated that the proportion of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries increased rapidly during the study period, and outdoor injuries and seasonal variation (with peak incidences in May and June) were more prominent in older children. Based on similarities between both datasets, the detailed results regarding pediatric traumatic injuries obtained from the single-institutional data could be generalized nationally with adequate external validity. To prevent traumatic injuries, it may be more effective to wear protective equipment covering the head and distal extremities rather than the trunk or proximal extremities; simple clothing, such as caps, could prevent many injuries in preschoolers. Among older children, safety guidelines for outdoor sports/leisure activities are needed. The increase in pediatric traumatic injuries may be partially explained by the increased availability of indoor playgrounds and installation of trampolines. Stricter adherence to the preventive guidelines is needed.","publish_time":"2019-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Michael Seungcheol; Kim, Han-Soo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bc6ead9368ec84dba7c56b78624f681293e568b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6688833.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398222/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220798","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Insurance Sharing Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outdoor injuries","extremity injuries","incidence of injuries","characteristics of pediatric traumatic injuries","trampoline-related injuries","single-institutional data","low-energy head injuries","older children","datasets","study period","proximal extremities","incidences of lower","peak incidences","year period","trunk","distal extremities","years","increased availability of indoor playgrounds","Korean National Health Insurance Sharing Service","outdoor sports","safety guidelines","detailed results","detailed information","preventive guidelines","sampled cases","proportion of indoor playground","emergency department visits","claim records","complementary approach","nationwide-sample","seasonal variation","simple clothing","fractures","leisure activities","protective equipment","authors\u0027 institute","installation of trampolines","injury environments","Stricter adherence","caps","adequate external validity","findings","similarities","preschoolers"],"language":"en"},

Understanding their transmission, and possibly forecasting the dynamics of these pathogens, represents both a scientific and sanitary emergency. To this goal, mathematical modeling has been a widely used tool. Nevertheless, they have important limitations to explicitly model the mechanisms involved in the infectious processes at the individual level. Thanks to the increase of computing capacity, computational models such as individual-based models (IBMs) are very relevant for understanding the complexity of mechanisms at the individual level that can be involved in disease outbreaks. Their computational formalism allows a large flexibility, while they rely on the same philosophy than current models in mathematical epidemiology that have proved their relevance. In this chapter, we review the main qualities of IBMs, what kind of new knowledge they can bring and they have already produced in epidemiological modeling. Then, we highlight their caveats and what could be developed during the future years to make IBMs a more reliable and useful approach.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roche, Benjamin; Duboz, Rapha\u00EBl","journal":"Handbook of Statistics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2e9534fdb31ca63dc2f671e292cbd6abe3e950e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169716117300226; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169716117300226","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["computational models","individual level","individual-based models","current models","mathematical modeling","main qualities of IBMs","infectious diseases","infectious processes","computational formalism","mathematical epidemiology","complexity of mechanisms","epidemiological modeling","threatening concern","increase of computing capacity","philosophy","kind of new knowledge","human health","Abstract Today","Thanks","large flexibility","useful approach","future years","dynamics","pathogens","sanitary emergency","chapter","important limitations","relevance","goal","disease outbreaks","transmission","tool","caveats"],"language":"en"},

MERS-CoV has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact. Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed and is irredeemable with present technology. Genetic studies on MERS-CoV have shown that ORF1ab encodes replicase polyproteins and play a foremost role in viral infection. Therefore, ORF1ab replicase polyprotein may be used as a suitable target for disease control. Viral activity can be controlled by RNA interference (RNAi) technology, a leading method for post transcriptional gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner. However, there is a genetic inconsistency in different viral isolates; it is a great challenge to design potential RNAi (miRNA and siRNA) molecules which can silence the respective target genes rather than any other viral gene simultaneously. In the current study, four effective miRNA and five siRNA molecules for silencing of nine different strains of MERS-CoV were rationally designed and corroborated using computational methods, which might lead to knockdown the activity of virus. siRNA and miRNA molecules were predicted against ORF1ab gene of different strains of MERS-CoV as effective candidate using computational methods. Thus, this method may provide an insight for the chemical synthesis of antiviral RNA molecule for the treatment of MERS-CoV, at genomic level.","publish_time":"2015-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nur, Suza Mohammad; Hasan, Md.

Fluid therapy administration due to dehydration, average weight gain, and the fecal microbiome were also evaluated. Bull calves used in this study were born from normal parturition, fed 4 L of pooled pasteurized colostrum by esophageal feeder, and moved to a research facility at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). A double-blinded randomized clinical trial was designed to allocate a total of 40 newborn calves into 1 of 2 treatment groups: calves receiving (twice daily) a solution containing 500 mg of SB-300 added to the whole milk for the first 15 d of life (SB-300, n = 20) or a control group receiving sterile water added to whole milk for the same period (CTR, n = 20).

Additionally, significantly fewer events of diarrhea were observed for calves in the SB-300 group (16.9%) compared with calves in the CTR group (46.5%). Dehydration status was evaluated and treated accordingly; calves with moderate dehydration were offered oral electrolytes, and calves with severe dehydration were rescued with intravenous fluid therapy. Calves in the SB-300 group had fewer intravenous fluid therapies administered during the study period (1.6%) compared with the CTR group (3.1%). Overall fluid therapy administered (oral electrolytes plus intravenous fluids) was significantly higher for the CTR group (9.2%) compared with the SB-300 group (6.1%) during the study period. No differences in milk consumption, calf starter intake, or weight gain were observed between treatment groups. A single time increase in Bifidobacterium was observed on d 20 of life for the SB-300 group; otherwise, no differences in fecal microbiome profile were detected between treatment groups. These results suggest that 500 mg of SB-300 added to the milk for 15 d can reduce the incidence of diarrhea and reduce severe dehydration in milk-fed calves.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teixeira, A.G.V.; Ribeiro, B.

Ferrets have been widely used to evaluate respiratory virus infections. In the current study, we used EV-D68-infected ferrets as a potential animal to identify impersonal indices, involving clinical features and histopathological changes in the upper and lower respiratory tract (URT and LRT). The research results demonstrate that the EV-D68 virus leads to minimal clinical symptoms in ferrets. According to the viral load detection in the feces, nasal, and respiratory tracts, the infection and shedding of EV-D68 in the ferret model was confirmed, and these results were supported by the EV-D68 VP1 immunofluorescence confocal imaging with \u03B12,6-linked sialic acid (SA) in lung tissues. Furthermore, we detected the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression level, which implied high expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-8, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-17a in the lungs.

An individual\u0027s cellular response appears to play a critical role in recovery from infections, given that individuals with impaired cellular immunity, congenital or acquired, have more severe diseases and secrete the virus for longer periods. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically evaluate the expression of the cell surface antigens CD4, CD8, CD25, CD14 and CD74, in pneumonic infiltrates in the alveolar septa using paraffin-embedded lung samples from autopsies of immunocompetent children who died of lethal, non-pandemic, severe acute respiratory infections. STUDY DESIGN: From 794 cases of pediatric autopsies of patients with severe respiratory disease (between 1960 and 2004), 193 cases were selected for this study. To identify subpopulations of inflammatory cells in the alveolar septa, cell surface antigen expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the following primary antibodies: anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD14, anti-CD25 and anti-CD74. RESULTS: The TCD8\u002B lymphocyte count was higher in the virus-positive group (p = 0.04) and was also much higher among cases that were positive for more than three viral types (p = 0.016). There were fewer CD14\u002B cells in cases of AdV (adenovirus) infection (p = 0.002), and there was a predominance of CD74\u002B cells in the histopathological pattern defined as interstitial pneumonitis (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that TCD8\u002B lymphocytes present in the alveolar septa participate to a greater extent in the response toward viral pneumonia, while CD14\u002B cell numbers are often reduced in cases of AdV.","publish_time":"2014-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Souza Costa, Victor Hor\u00E1cio; Baurakiades, Emanuele; Viola Azevedo, Marina Louise; Traiano, Gabriela; Kowal Rosales, Jeana; Kunze Larsen, Kelly Susana; Raboni, Sonia Maria; de Noronha, Lucia","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/164b06dfaee2407cfa4fb66b7d895f31fe059a76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173026.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214002595; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214002595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052332/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.06.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AdV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-CD14","anti-CD74","anti-CD4","anti-CD8","anti-CD25","cases of AdV","alveolar septa","severe acute respiratory infections","Acute viral respiratory infections","fewer CD14","STUDY DESIGN","severe respiratory disease","cases of pediatric autopsies of patients","cell surface antigens CD4","cell surface antigen expression","viral pneumonia","cell numbers","TCD8","severe diseases","viral types","predominance of CD74","RESULTS","virus-positive group","subpopulations of inflammatory cells","individual\u0027s cellular response","autopsies of immunocompetent children","impaired cellular immunity","paraffin-embedded lung samples","non-pandemic","immunohistochemistry","individuals","following primary antibodies","histopathological pattern","greater extent","important cause of morbidity","pneumonic infiltrates","lymphocyte count","lymphocytes present","adenovirus","critical role","mortality","recovery","interstitial pneumonitis","BACKGROUND","childhood","longer periods","OBJECTIVES","aim","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity elicited an acute inflammatory response characterized by protein rich fluid accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in the pleural cavity. The peak inflammatory response was obtained at 24h when the fluid volume, protein concentration, C-reactive protein and cell infiltration were maximums. The results showed that these parameters were attenuated by HCI at any dose and touched bottom at dose of 0.54ml/100g, although less strong than dexamethasone.

An immunoaffinity column was made by covalently coupling the polyclonal antibody, obtained by the immunization with glycyrrhizin\u2013BSA conjugate, to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. By using this column, glycyrrhizin in Si-Ni-San was selectively and almost completely depleted from the whole extract, which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both 200 mg/kg of Si-Ni-San and 10 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin, the dose corresponding to its proportion contained in Si-Ni-San, significantly reduced the ear swelling of picryl chloride (PCl)-induced ear contact sensitivity in mice and the inhibition by Si-Ni-San was stronger than that by glycyrrhizin. The adhesion activity to type IV collagen of the isolated spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice was significantly decreased by both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin. However, the glycyrrhizin-depleted sample of Si-Ni-San (Si-Ni-San(GL\u2212)) only showed a slight inhibition on the cell adhesion. Furthermore, the spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice produced more matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 than naive spleen cells did, and both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin remarkably reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. In contrast, Si-Ni-San(GL\u2212) only showed a slight inhibition. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin may act as one of the active constituents of Si-Ni-San in inhibiting delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction via down-regulating the MMP production and the cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The present study also provides a new approach to recognize and validate an active constituent in traditional prescription through a selective depletion.","publish_time":"2005-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Li; Sun, Yang; Chen, Ting; Xu, Qiang","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a55240b7aba7aa52868e95c4afedf215d9f21df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106220.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576905000561; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576905000561","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ni-San","Si-Ni","glycyrrhizin-depleted sample of Si","suppressing activity of Si","active constituents of Si","PCl-sensitized mice","MMP production","reduced MMP","cell adhesion","adhesion activity","slight inhibition","isolated spleen cells","naive spleen cells","traditional Chinese prescription","traditional prescription","present study","induced ear contact sensitivity","Chinese herbs","extracellular matrix","matrix metalloproteinase","immunoaffinity column","delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction","BSA conjugate","immunization","influence","collagen","Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis","picryl chloride","CNBr-activated Sepharose","selective depletion","new approach","high-performance liquid chromatography","HPLC","proportion","contrast","polyclonal antibody","dose","extract","results"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the influence of LDT events on the invasive spread of raccoon rabies through Connecticut. We identified several putative LDT events, and developed a network-model to evaluate whether they became new foci for epidemic spread. LDT was fairly common, but many of the LDTs were isolated events that did not spread. Two putative LDT events did appear to become nascent foci that affected the epidemic in surrounding townships. In evaluating the role of LDT, we simultaneously revisited the problem of spatial heterogeneity. The spread of raccoon rabies is associated with forest cover\u2014rabies moves up to three-times slower through the most heavily forested townships compared with those with less forestation. Forestation also modified the effect of rivers. In the best overall model, rabies did not cross the river separating townships that were heavily forested, and the spread slowed substantially between townships that were lightly forested. Our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity can be used to enhance the effects of rabies control by focusing vaccine bait distribution along rivers in lightly forested areas. LDT events are a concern, but this analysis suggests that at a local scale they can be isolated and managed.","publish_time":"2005-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, D. L.; Waller, L. A.; Russell, C.

It has been recently suggested that SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS may differ from usual non-SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS by higher respiratory system compliance (C(RS)), lower potential for recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) contrasting with severe shunt fraction. The purpose of the study was to systematically assess respiratory mechanics and recruitability in SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS. METHODS: Gas exchanges, C(RS) and hemodynamics were assessed at 2 levels of PEEP (15 cmH(2)O and 5 cmH(2)O) within 36 h (day1) and from 4 to 6 days (day 5) after intubation. The recruited volume was computed as the difference between the volume expired from PEEP 15 to 5 cmH(2)O and the volume predicted by compliance at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O (or above airway opening pressure). The recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between the recruited lung compliance and C(RS) at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O) was used to assess lung recruitability. A R/I ratio value higher than or equal to 0.5 was used to define highly recruitable patients. RESULTS: The R/I ratio was calculated in 25 of the 26 enrolled patients at day 1 and in 15 patients at day 5. At day 1, 16 (64%) were considered as highly recruitable (R/I ratio median [interquartile range] 0.7 [0.55\u20130.94]) and 9 (36%) were considered as poorly recruitable (R/I ratio 0.41 [0.31\u20130.48]). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O was higher compared to PEEP 5 cmH(2)O only in highly recruitable patients (173 [139\u2013236] vs 135 [89\u2013167] mmHg; p \u003C 0.01). Neither PaO(2)/FiO(2) or C(RS) measured at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O or at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O nor changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2) or C(RS) in response to PEEP changes allowed to identify highly or poorly recruitable patients. CONCLUSION: In this series of 25 patients with SARS-Cov-2 associated ARDS, 64% were considered as highly recruitable and only 36% as poorly recruitable based on the R/I ratio performed on the day of intubation. This observation suggests that a systematic R/I ratio assessment may help to guide initial PEEP titration to limit harmful effect of unnecessary high PEEP in the context of Covid-19 crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beloncle, Fran\u00E7ois M.; Pavlovsky, Bertrand; Desprez, Christophe; Fage, Nicolas; Olivier, Pierre-Yves; Asfar, Pierre; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Mercat, Alain","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/132de5aa35e5438f377f0e3c370a5043aa87156a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215140.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399901/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00675-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cmH","PEEP changes","recruitable patients","levels of PEEP","associated ARDS","ratio median","ratio assessment","initial PEEP titration","ratio value higher","systematic R","enrolled patients","day of intubation","harmful effect of unnecessary high PEEP","usual non-SARS-Cov","large proportion of patients","FiO","PaO","higher respiratory system compliance","respiratory failure","respiratory mechanics","recruited volume","recruited lung compliance","recruitment","lung recruitability","acute respiratory distress syndrome","positive end-expiratory pressure","lower potential","context of Covid","Gas exchanges","difference","response","interquartile range","severe shunt fraction","study","METHODS","BACKGROUND","hemodynamics","series","inflation","crisis","observation","day1","days","airway","RESULTS","mmHg","purpose","CONCLUSION","vs"],"language":"en"},

It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. We identified factors associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus. We also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission. METHOD: We included subjects with suspected MERS-CoV infection and confirmed cases of MERS infection. Subjects were excluded if there were any missing data that prevent the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data. Percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of MERS-CoV infection among the suspected cases. A value of p \u003C 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 16,189 suspected cases were identified, complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.06; 95% CI [1.02\u20131.098], P-value = 0.004), male gender (AOR = 1.617; 95% CI [1.365\u20131.77], P-value \u003C 0.001) and diabetes (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI [1.346\u20131.848], P-value = 0.002. There was no significant association with the other comorbidities. Medication history was not associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-Cov infection is more common in male, advanced age and diabetes. No medications were associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection. This is important to focus on screening and detection to this patient population.","publish_time":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alburikan, Khalid A.; Abuelizz, Hatem A.","journal":"Saudi Pharm J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa27ee27248b8daab7e85d3fd1044383876b099a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c23db0f0dc55dea350cd7e27939acad930c6c85a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7000305.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319016419301665; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2019.11.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32042254/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319016419301665","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["suspected MERS-CoV infection","confirmed cases of MERS infection","risk of MERS","suspected cases","symptoms of upper respiratory infection","value of p","P-value","AOR","respiratory disease","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus","demographic data","missing data","complete data","diabetes","subjects","increase","factors","likelihood","significant mortality","significant association","impact of medication history","advanced age","novel coronavirus","male gender","virus transmission","categorical variables","continuous variables","exposure","standard deviations","adjusted odds ratio","screening","detection","BACKGROUND","patient population","final analysis","total","CONCLUSIONS","Descriptive statistics","frequencies","comorbidities","morbidity","RESULTS","METHOD","Logistic regression","Saudi Arabia","Percentages","medications"],"language":"en"},

Methods In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with CPB, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and blood pressure (BP) were continuously recorded during 5-min preoperatively (T1), after 24 h (T2), and 7 days after procedure (T3). Prospective multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent risk factors of PD. Autoregulation index (ARI) was calculated from the CBFV response to a step change in BP derived by transfer function analysis. Results In 67 patients, mean age 64.3 \u00B1 9.5 years, CA was depressed at T2 as shown by values of ARI (3.9 \u00B1 1.7), compared to T1 (5.6 \u00B1 1.7) and T3 (5.5 \u00B1 1.8) (p \u003C 0.001).

Carrying segmented RNA genomes, their genetic variability is even higher. We aimed at analyzing the mutational events occurring during the infection of chickens by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. We therefore studied the different sequences of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as two internal proteins, PB2 and NS. Three organs (lung, spleen, brain) were obtained from a chicken, experimentally infected with a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus. Cloning these PCR fragments enabled us to investigate the mutations undergone by the virus after several replicative cycles. The first outcome is the presence of a strong mutational bias, resembling host-driven ADAR1 adenosine deamination, which is responsible for 81% of all mutations. Whereas the frequency of RNA dependent RNA polymerase-related mutations is compatible with the survival of the virus, the ADAR1-like activity usually strongly increases the mutation frequency into a level of \u201Cerror catastrophe\u201D in theory incompatible with virus survival. Nevertheless, the virus was successfully infective. HPAI H5N1 virus displayed traits in agreement with the quasispecies theory. The role of this quasispecies structure in successful infection and the superposition with the ADAR1-like response is discussed.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guti\u00E9rrez, Ramona Alikiiteaga; Viari, Alain; Godelle, Bernard; Frutos, Roger; Buchy, Philippe","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16f3a2bdb7fc27ff77bc4479be26d5857b03aa71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106232.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.10.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134811003765; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811003765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22063822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus survival","RNA viruses","lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus","frequency of RNA dependent RNA polymerase-related mutations","influenza viruses","segmented RNA genomes","mutation frequency","quasispecies theory","successful infection","infection of chickens","surface proteins","theory incompatible","quasispecies structure","internal proteins","mutational events","Pathogenic Avian Influenza","resembling host-driven ADAR1 adenosine deamination","strong mutational bias","high mutation rates","traits","agreement","hemagglutinin","genetic variability","superposition","error catastrophe","brain","presence","level","activity","different sequences","organs","lung","spleen","neuraminidase","PB2","role","Abstract","outcome","response","replicative cycles","PCR fragments"],"language":"en"},

Because of the limited effectiveness of existing vaccines and drugs, development of novel antiviral strategies is urgently needed. Heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc70) is an ATP-binding protein of the heat stress protein 70 family. Hsc70 has been found to be required for HBV DNA replication. Here we report, for the first time, that combined siRNAs targeting viral gene and siHsc70 are highly effective in suppressing ongoing HBV expression and replication. METHODS: We constructed two plasmids (S1 and S2) expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting surface open reading frame of HBV(HBVS) and one plasmid expressing shRNA targeting Hsc70 (siHsc70), and we used the EGFP-specific siRNA plasmid (siEGFP) as we had previously described. First, we evaluated the gene-silencing efficacy of both shRNAs using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter system and flow cytometry in HEK293 and T98G cells. Then, the antiviral potencies of HBV-specific siRNA (siHBV) in combination with siHsc70 in HepG2.2.15 cells were investigated. Moreover, type I IFN and TNF-\u03B1 induction were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: Cotransfection of either S1 or S2 with an EGFP plasmid produced an 80%\u201390% reduction in EGFP signal relative to the control. This combinational RNAi effectively and specifically inhibited HBV protein, mRNA and HBV DNA, resulting in up to a 3.36 log(10) reduction in HBV load in the HepG2.2.15 cell culture supernatants. The combined siRNAs were more potent than siHBV or siHsc70 used separately, and this approach can enhance potency in suppressing ongoing viral gene expression and replication in HepG2.2.15 cells while forestalling escape by mutant HBV. The antiviral synergy of siHBV used in combination with siHsc70 produced no cytotoxicity and induced no production of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2 and TNF-\u03B1 in transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our combinational RNAi was sequence-specific, effective against wild-type and mutant drug-resistant HBV strains, without triggering interferon response or producing any side effects. These findings indicate that combinational RNAi has tremendous promise for developing innovative therapy against viral infection.","publish_time":"2012-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bian, Zhongqi; Xiao, An; Cao, Mingmei; Liu, Mingqiu; Liu, Shuang; Jiao, Ye; Yan, Weiyao; Qi, Zhongtian; Zheng, Zhaoxin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a94e4109b44346c490243c71fd533cd1a9fd047c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3534549.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23158906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV","EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutant HBV","HBV load","inhibited HBV protein","HBV DNA replication","siHsc70","ongoing HBV expression","antiviral potencies of HBV","EGFP plasmid","mutant drug-resistant HBV strains","HepG2","EGFP-specific siRNA plasmid","combinational RNAi","surface open reading frame of HBV","heat stress protein","viral infection","ongoing viral gene expression","T98G cells","transfected cells","antiviral synergy of siHBV","shRNAs","ATP-binding protein","sequence-specific","TNF-\u03B1 induction","IFN-\u03B2","EGFP signal relative","S1","S2","production of IFN","combined siRNAs","reduction","enhanced green fluorescent protein","gene-silencing efficacy","Heat stress cognate","development of novel antiviral strategies","wild-type","drugs","reporter system","flow cytometry","HEK293","tremendous promise","HBVS","short hairpin RNAs","innovative therapy","Hepatitis B virus","potency","limited effectiveness of existing vaccines","quantitative real-time PCR","mRNA","interferon response","BACKGROUND","major health concern","cytotoxicity","siEGFP","escape","cell culture supernatants","ELISA","control","plasmids","Cotransfection","findings","CONCLUSIONS","approach","family","individuals","effects","RESULTS","log","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

It is necessary to know the protection conferred by commonly used commercial live vaccines. In this study, specific pathogen-free chicks were vaccinated with the commercial live vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A. Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals for the detection of IBV-specific antibodies and quantification of CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes. At 21 days post-inoculation the vaccinated birds were challenged with the IBV prevalent local strains GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032, respectively. Trachea and kidney samples were collected at 5 days post-challenge for the detection of the virus. The results showed that the H120 group exhibited medium antibody levels, the lowest percentages of CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes and the highest viral loads. The 4/91 group showed the lowest antibody levels, but the highest percentages of CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes and the lowest viral loads.

The global pig sector, with its size and dichotomy between production type and biosecurity level, is particularly vulnerable to the transmission of transboundary animal diseases such as African and classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease, or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. All of the above pose a constant threat to swine health, mainly as a result of both formal and informal international trade. Inspired in the risk assessment methodology, this paper classifies and provides an overview of the different pig disease introduction and exposure pathways, illustrated with abundant examples. Introduction pathways are classified as formal international trade (by product), informal international trade (by product), and spread through fomites. Formal trade of pigs and pork products is regulated by legislation and measures protecting animal populations from exotic diseases. Much more difficult to control is the transboundary swine disease transmission originating through informal trade, which entails illegal smuggling, but also the informal cross-border transfer of animals and products for personal use or within informal market chains. Meat products are most commonly mentioned, although fomites have also played a role in some cases, with live pigs, being more difficult to smuggle playing a role less frequently. The main exposure pathways are also described with the oral route playing a prominent role. Risk assessments can aid in the identification of pathways of pathogen introduction and exposure. However, quantitative information on informal disease introduction pathways remains very scarce and often incomplete, making it difficult to estimate the actual magnitudes of risks. Nevertheless, this knowledge is deemed essential to set up risk based awareness, prevention and surveillance programs that correspond to reality.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beltran-Alcrudo, Daniel; Falco, John R.; Raizman, Eran; Dietze, Klaas","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8a9aa42224ef1fe08733dda2169f2e18ce6e92d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6387505.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1800-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30795759/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["informal trade","informal disease introduction pathways","informal international trade","trade of animals","introduction of diseases","Formal trade of pigs","animal products","different pig disease introduction","identification of pathways","pathogen introduction","main exposure pathways","informal market chains","mouth disease","swine health","transmission of transboundary animal diseases","pork products","Meat products","prominent role","transboundary swine disease transmission originating","informal cross-border transfer of animals","animal populations","exotic diseases","prominent threat","Risk assessments","fomites","classical swine fever","global pig sector","risk assessment methodology","livestock sector","public health","live pigs","constant threat","foot","personal use","dichotomy","size","measures","biosecurity level","production type","food security","awareness","legislation","overview","result","quantitative information","surveillance programs","livelihoods of farmers","illegal smuggling","nations","paper","prevention","economies","industries","respiratory syndrome","oral route","interconnectedness","cases","abundant examples","actual magnitudes of risks","globalization","reality","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the present study was to examine the epidemiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) in two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a prospective surveillance study of persons with ILI who presented for care at two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela, from October 2006 to December 2010. A respiratory specimen and clinical information were obtained from each participant. Viral isolation and identification with immunofluorescent antibodies and molecular methods were employed to detect respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and respiratory sincytial virus, among others. There were 916 participants in the study (median age: 17 years; range: 1 month \u2013 86 years). Viruses were identified in 143 (15.6%) subjects, and one participant was found to have a co-infection with more than one virus. Influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1 2009, were the most frequently detected pathogens, accounting for 67.4% (97/144) of the viruses detected. Adenovirus (15/144), parainfluenza virus (13/144), and respiratory syncytial virus (11/144) were also important causes of ILI in this study. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus became the most commonly isolated influenza virus during its initial appearance in 2009. Two waves of the pandemic were observed: the first which peaked in August 2009 and the second - higher than the preceding - that peaked in October 2009. In 2010, influenza A/H3N2 re-emerged as the most predominant respiratory virus detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Influenza viruses were the most commonly detected viral organisms among patients with acute febrile respiratory illnesses presenting at two hospitals in Maracay, Venezuela. Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus did not completely replace other circulating influenza viruses during its initial appearance in 2009.

In this study, the full-length sequences of two KAA isoforms, KAA-1 and KAA-2, were elucidated by a combination of peptide mapping and cDNA cloning. They consisted of four internal tandem-repeated domains, which are conserved in high-mannose specific lectins from lower organisms, including a cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii and a red alga Eucheuma serra. Using an Escherichia coli expression system, an active recombinant form of KAA-1 (His-tagged rKAA-1) was successfully generated in the yield of 115 mg per a litter of culture. In a detailed oligosaccharide binding analysis by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method with 27 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, His-tagged rKAA-1 and rKAA-1 specifically bound to high-mannose N-glycans with an exposed \u03B11-3 mannose in the D2 arm as the native lectin did. Predicted from oligosaccharide-binding specificity, a surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the recombinants exhibit strong interaction with gp120, a heavily glycosylated envelope glycoprotein of HIV with high association constants (1.48\u20131.61 \u00D7 10(9) M(\u22121)). Native KAAs and the recombinants inhibited the HIV-1 entry at IC(50)s of low nanomolar levels (7.3\u201312.9 nM).

In marine mammals, adenovirus has been associated with fatal hepatitis in sea lions. However, only in rare cases have adenoviruses been detected in cetaceans, where no clear correlation was found between presence of the virus and disease status. CASE PRESENTATION: A novel adenovirus was identified in four captive bottlenose dolphins with self-limiting gastroenteritis. Viral detection and identification were achieved by: PCR-amplification from fecal samples; sequencing of partial adenovirus polymerase (pol) and hexon genes; producing the virus in HeLa cells, with PCR and immunofluorescence detection, and with sequencing of the amplified pol and hexon gene fragments. A causative role of this adenovirus for gastroenteritis was suggested by: 1) we failed to identify other potential etiological agents; 2) the exclusive detection of this novel adenovirus and of seropositivity for canine adenoviruses 1 and 2 in the four sick dolphins, but not in 10 healthy individuals of the same captive population; and 3) the virus disappeared from feces after clinical signs receded. The partial sequences of the amplified fragments of the pol and hexon genes were closest to those of adenoviruses identified in sea lions with fatal adenoviral hepatitis, and to a Genbank-deposited sequence obtained from a harbour porpoise. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adenovirus can cause self-limiting gastroenteritis in dolphins. This adenoviral infection can be detected by serology and by PCR detection in fecal material. Lack of signs of hepatitis in sick dolphins may reflect restricted tissue tropism or virulence of this adenovirus compared to those of the adenovirus identified in sea lions. Gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supports a common origin of adenoviruses that affect sea mammals. Our findings suggest the need for vigilance against adenoviruses in captive and wild dolphin populations.","publish_time":"2015-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubio-Guerri, Consuelo; Garc\u00EDa-P\u00E1rraga, Daniel; Nieto-Pelegr\u00EDn, Elvira; Melero, Mar; \u00C1lvaro, Teresa; Valls, M\u00F3nica; Crespo, Jose Luis; S\u00E1nchez-Vizca\u00EDno, Jose Manuel","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c32c7f59bd902e4b2ef9fbe78e87c1d683de2d42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4352565.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25888777/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0367-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel adenovirus","canine adenoviruses","PCR detection","sea lions","sequencing of partial adenovirus polymerase","common origin of adenoviruses","sick dolphins","sea mammals","captive bottlenose dolphins","amplified pol","hexon genes","fatal hepatitis","immunofluorescence detection","exclusive detection","self-limiting gastroenteritis","Viral detection","hexon gene fragments","fatal adenoviral hepatitis","amplified fragments","captive population","PCR-amplification","Gene sequence","fecal samples","common pathogens","fecal material","partial sequences","clinical signs","Lack of signs","adenoviral infection","marine mammals","Genbank-deposited sequence","restricted tissue tropism","phylogenetic analysis","presence","vigilance","HeLa cells","serology","wild dolphin populations","cetaceans","virulence","vertebrates","need","seropositivity","healthy individuals","clear correlation","potential etiological agents","harbour porpoise","humans","disease status","feces","BACKGROUND","identification","data","CASE PRESENTATION","causative role","rare cases","findings","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

One clear approach to this problem is to target processes of the host organism rather than the microbe. Recent data have indicated that members of the tetraspanin superfamily, proteins with a widespread distribution in eukaryotic organisms and 33 members in humans, may provide such an approach. Tetraspanins traverse the membrane four times, but are distinguished from other four-pass membrane proteins by the presence of conserved charged residues in the transmembrane domains and a defining \u2018signature\u2019 motif in the larger of the two extracellular domains (the EC2). They characteristically form promiscuous associations with one another and with other membrane proteins and lipids to generate a specialized type of microdomain: the tetraspanin-enriched microdomain (TEM). TEMs are integral to the main role of tetraspanins as \u2018molecular organizers\u2019 involved in functions such as membrane trafficking, cell-cell fusion, motility, and signaling. Increasing evidence demonstrates that tetraspanins are used by intracellular pathogens as a means of entering and replicating within human cells. Although previous investigations focused mainly on viruses such as hepatitis C and HIV, it is now becoming clear that other microbes associate with tetraspanins, using TEMs as a \u2018gateway\u2019 to infection. In this article we review the properties and functions of tetraspanins/TEMs that are relevant to infective processes and discuss the accumulating evidence that shows how different pathogens exploit these properties in infection and in the pathogenesis of disease. We then investigate the novel and exciting possibilities of targeting tetraspanins for the treatment of infectious disease, using specific antibodies, recombinant EC2 domains, small-molecule mimetics, and small interfering RNA. Such therapies, directed at host-cell molecules, may provide alternative options for combating fast-mutating or newly emerging pathogens, where conventional approaches face difficulties.","publish_time":"2012-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassuna, Noha; Monk, Peter N.; Moseley, Gregory W.; Partridge, Lynda J.","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5132ee030760d167ab3dac4a5209b2c6acef08d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100176.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2165/11315650-000000000-00000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19894777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tetraspanins"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functions of tetraspanins","membrane proteins","TEMs","main role of tetraspanins","membrane trafficking","emerging pathogens","cell-cell fusion","exciting possibilities of targeting tetraspanins","transmembrane domains","viruses","recombinant EC2 domains","extracellular domains","members","host-cell molecules","different pathogens","properties","intracellular pathogens","emerging diseases","HIV","clear approach","tetraspanin-enriched microdomain","tetraspanin superfamily","infective processes","conventional approaches","pandemic diseases","pathogenesis of disease","accumulating evidence","host organism","small-molecule mimetics","small interfering RNA","treatment of infectious disease","specialized type of microdomain","identification of novel targets","failure of conventional vaccines","SARS","specific antibodies","new influenza strains","therapy of microbial infections","strategies","severe acute respiratory syndrome","widespread distribution","presence of conserved charged residues","eukaryotic organisms","antibiotic-resistant bacteria","area of intensive research","signature","antibiotics","molecular organizers\u2019","defining","humans","lipids","motif","means","alternative options","hepatitis C","difficulties","problem","motility","microbes","Recent data","previous investigations","article","gateway","therapies","times","human cells","promiscuous associations"],"language":"en"},

The N-terminal fragment of a giant tegument protein, UL36, encoded by the Marek\u2019s disease (MD) virus (MDV), encompasses a putative DUB (UL36-DUB) and shares no homology with any known DUBs. The N-terminus 75 kDa fragment of UL36 exists in MD T lymphoma cells at a high level and participates in MDV pathogenicity. (2) Methods: To characterize deubiquitinating activity and substrate specificity of UL36-DUB, the UL36 N-terminal fragments, UL36(323), UL36(480), and mutants were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac system. The deubiquitinating activity and substrate specificity of these recombinant UL36-DUBs were analyzed using various ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like (UbL) substrates and activity-based deubiquitinating enzyme probes. (3) Results: The results indicated that wild type UL36-DUBs show a different hydrolysis ability against varied types of ubiquitin chains. These wild type UL36-DUBs presented the highest activity to K11, K48, and K63 linkage Ub chains, weak activity to K6, K29, and K33 Ub chains, and no activity to K27 linkage Ub chain. UL36 has higher cleavage efficiency for K48 and K63 poly-ubiquitin than linear ubiquitin chain (M1-Ub4), but no activity on various ubiquitin-like modifiers. The mutation of C98 and H234 residues eliminated the deubiquitinating activity of UL36-DUB. D232A mutation impacted, but did not eliminated UL36(480) activity. The Ub-Br probe can bind to wild type UL36-DUB and mutants UL36(480)(H234A) and UL36(480)(D232A), but not C98 mutants. These in vitro results suggested that the C98 and H234 are essential catalytic residues of UL36-DUB. UL36-DUB exhibited a strict substrate specificity. Inhibition assay revealed that UL36-DUB exhibits resistance to the Roche protease inhibitor cocktail and serine protease inhibitor, but not to the Solarbio protease inhibitor cocktail. (4) Conclusions: UL36-DUB exhibited a strict substrate preference, and the protocol developed in the current study for obtaining active UL36-DUB protein should promote the high-throughput screening of UL36 inhibitors and the study on the function of MDV-encoded UL36.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Junyan; Ai, Yongxing; Zhou, Hongda; Lv, Yan; Wang, Menghan; Xu, Jiacui; Yu, Cong; Zhang, Huanmin; Wang, Mengyun","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1535ca43838cf5d33c33e7a5690ee76786eedf69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7084888.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150874/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21051783","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDV","Solarbio"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutants UL36","encoded UL36","deubiquitinating activity of UL36","substrate specificity of UL36","active UL36-DUB protein","recombinant UL36-DUBs","UL36-DUB exhibits resistance","kDa fragment of UL36","wild type UL36-DUBs","UL36 N-terminal fragments","essential catalytic residues of UL36","putative DUB","high-throughput screening of UL36 inhibitors","weak activity","highest activity","various ubiquitin","K63 poly-ubiquitin","linear ubiquitin chain","K63 linkage Ub chains","K33 Ub chains","strict substrate specificity","C98 mutants","Results","varied types of ubiquitin chains","K27 linkage Ub chain","known DUBs","mutation of C98","serine protease inhibitor","strict substrate preference","Ub-Br probe","Roche protease inhibitor cocktail","Solarbio protease inhibitor cocktail","K48","H234 residues","protein ubiquitination","function of MDV","deubiquitinating enzyme probes","N-terminus","MDV pathogenicity","D232A mutation","giant tegument protein","high level","various important cellular processes","current study","Bac system","MD T lymphoma cells","different hydrolysis ability","K29","K11","higher cleavage efficiency","protocol","M1-Ub4","substrates","Marek\u2019s disease","virus","Deubiquitinase","Inhibition assay","homology","UbL","modifiers","H234A","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The household has traditionally been the site for studying acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). Most studies were conducted many years ago, and more broadly sensitive laboratory methods to determine ARI etiology are now available. Methods. We recruited and followed households with children over 3 annual surveillance periods and collected respiratory tract specimens from subjects with reported ARI. Virus etiology was determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Results. Individuals in larger households (defined as households with \u003E4 members) and those in households with children aged \u003C5 years had significantly higher ARI frequencies than others. ARI frequency generally declined with increasing age. Virus etiology was most likely to be determined in young children, who were also most likely to have virus coinfection. Overall, 16% of ARIs with 1 virus identified had \u22651 coinfecting virus. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were the most frequently identified agents of ARI in all age categories. Influenza virus and adenovirus were less frequently identified but were most likely to cause ARI that required medical attention. Conclusions. Longitudinal studies in families remain a valuable way to study respiratory infections. RT-PCR has increased the sensitivity of virus detection, including coinfecting viruses, and expanded our ability to detect viruses now known to cause ARI.","publish_time":"2014-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monto, Arnold S.; Malosh, Ryan E.; Petrie, Joshua G.; Thompson, Mark G.; Ohmit, Suzanne E.","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c1e0ff0642e4509109804174d97fe0fe85a970e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4296188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907381/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4296188?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiu327","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARI etiology","Virus etiology","reported ARI","ARI frequency","Influenza virus","virus coinfection","identified agents of ARI","higher ARI frequencies","sensitivity of virus detection","larger households","respiratory infections","RT-PCR","years","coinfecting viruses","young children","ARIs","respiratory tract specimens","acute respiratory illnesses","increasing age","age categories","Longitudinal studies","sensitive laboratory methods","real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","annual surveillance periods","valuable way","subjects","families","site","coronaviruses","analysis","ability","medical attention","Individuals","adenovirus","members","Rhinoviruses","Background","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The membrane (M) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is highly abundant during viral infections and is a critical element for viral assembly. Nucleotide substitution in the viral genome occurs frequently during SARS-CoV infection. In the current study, we analyzed the M gene sequences derived from 15 SARS-CoV isolates and uncovered six nucleotide substitutions among these isolates. Interestingly, these nucleotide substitutions are all located at the 5\u2019 half of the M gene. Based on this information and previous reports, we created two novel siRNAs targeting two unexplored and well conserved regions in the M gene. The effects of these two siRNAs were tested by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and EGFP-M fusion gene expression. The results demonstrated that both siRNAs effectively and specifically blocked the targeted gene expression. Real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that siRNA targeting the 3\u2019 half of the M gene (si-M2) induced more potent inhibition than that targeting the 5\u2019 half (si-M1). Both si-M1 and si-M2 significantly downregulated M gene mediated upregulation of interferon \u03B2 expression. Thus, our results indicate that SARS-CoV M gene specific siRNA might function in a sequence-dependent manner.","publish_time":"2010-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ying; Cao, Ying-Li; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Yun; Wang, Shu-Hui; Liu, Li","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3f7f0af7fceb8d73489863fca4c5ebb608f6fd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6259191.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules15107197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956884/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["targeted gene expression","gene sequences","fusion gene expression","gene specific siRNA","SARS-CoV isolates","SARS-CoV infection","si-M2","si-M1","half","gene mediated upregulation of interferon \u03B2 expression","nucleotide substitutions","qRT-PCR","semi-quantitative RT-PCR","viral genome","viral infections","viral assembly","novel siRNAs","results","Real time quantitative RT-PCR","Small interfering RNA","class of duplex RNA molecules","EGFP","protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","critical element","nt nucleotides","length","previous reports","conserved regions","sequence-dependent manner","potent inhibition","information","membrane","current study","effects"],"language":"en"},

However, it also has disadvantages. For example, the rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post\u2010translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity. Fortunately, multiple, novel reagents and techniques have been developed that allow for the efficient, soluble production of a diverse range of heterologous proteins in E. coli .

Multiplex real time RT-PCR helps in simultaneous detection of multiple viruses saving cost, time and labour. Commercially available multiplex real time RT-PCR kits are very expensive. Therefore the aim of the present study was to develop a cost effective multiplex real time RT-PCR for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses and compare it with an in-vitro diagnostics approved Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens 21 Kit (FTD). METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat swabs were collected and processed for extraction of nucleic acid using an automated extraction system and multiplex real time RT-PCR was performed using the FTD kit and a custom assay on 356 samples. RESULTS: Custom and FTD assays detected one or more respiratory viruses in 268 (75.29 %) and 262 (73.60 %) samples respectively. The concordance between the custom assay and the FTD assay was 100 % for HCoV OC43, HCoV 229E, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HBoV, HPeV, Flu A, and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 94.66 \u2013 99.71 % for the remaining viruses; Flu B (99.71 %), HRV (99.71 %), HPIV-3 (98.87 %), HPIV-4 (99.43 %), HCoV NL63 (99.71 %), HMPV A/B (99.71 %), RSV A/B (94.66 %), EV (98.31 %), HCoV HKU1 (99.71 %), HAdV (99.71 %). Major discrepancy was observed for RSV A/B, which was over detected in 18 samples by the custom assay as compared to the FTD assay. The custom assay was much cheaper than the FTD assay and the time taken was only 29 min more. CONCLUSION: The custom primer and probe mix was found to be comparable to the FTD assay with good concordance but was much cheaper and the time taken for reporting was only 29 min more. The low cost custom multiplex RT-PCR can be a useful alternative to the costly FTD kit for rapid identification of viral aetiology in resource limited settings.","publish_time":"2016-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malhotra, Bharti; Swamy, M.

The model was formulated in a mixed-effects Poisson model framework with normally distributed random effects, and was fitted to the data by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. Important fixed effects included whether the calf was a twin, calf gender, assistance at calving, cow age, average temperature the first week after calving, the percentage of the herd that had already calved, whether calf shelters were provided, whether cow-calf pairs were moved to a nursery area, and whether any animals were purchased into the herd at or near the time of calving. The analysis demonstrated a greater variation among herds than among both ecological regions and veterinary clinics. Further, a simulation study for a setting similar to the real data gave evidence that the used approach provides valid estimates.","publish_time":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elghafghuf, Adel; Stryhn, Henrik; Waldner, Cheryl","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a50e3d5be9d24e4880d185f2735911820935a97d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114250.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758771400107X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703248/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.03.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758771400107X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["calf mortality data","calf gender","calf shelters","veterinary clinics","herds","multiple membership data structure","cow-calf pairs","real data","multiple membership Cox model","time of calving","multiple membership relation","ecological regions","level cross","mixed-effects Poisson model framework","distributed random effects","Important fixed effects","cow age","Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo","MCMC","evidence","average temperature","assistance","setting similar","used approach","week","Western Canada","estimation","twin","valid estimates","nursery area","greater variation","simulation study","animals","analysis","calves","percentage","days"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease. METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team. RESULTS: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients. The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Osong Public Health Res Perspect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7045878.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32149037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Korea","China","Japan","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases","confirmed COVID","second-generation cases","index cases","acquaintances of primary patients","cases of secondary infection","South Korea","epidemiological characteristics","early symptoms","confirmed case of coronavirus disease","epidemiological investigation reports","early clinical features","China","clinical characteristics","route of transmission","home","early detection strategy","suspected sites of transmission","foreign countries","close contact","initial symptoms","infected individuals","rapid response team","sore throat","sputum production","cough","surveillance data","family members","chills","fever","Wuhan","stage","reporting","Zhuhai","muscle ache","Singapore","Japan","METHODS","developed pneumonia","OBJECTIVES","Thailand","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present study was to characterize the production of cytokines by subpopulations of pulmonary macrophages in pigs infected by the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Expression of interleukin (IL) 1\u03B1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 correlated with the severity of pulmonary pathology and the numbers of pulmonary macrophages. Significant correlations were observed between PRRSV infection and the expression of IL-10, between the expression of IL-12p40 and interferon (IFN)-\u03B3, and between the expression of TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3. These findings suggest that PRRSV modulates the immune response by the up-regulation of IL-10, which may in turn reduce expression of cytokines involved in viral clearance (e.g. IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03B1). The results also suggest that expression of IFN-\u03B3 is stimulated by IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03B1, but not by IFN-\u03B1. All of these cytokines were expressed mainly by septal macrophages with weaker expression by alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. There appears to be differential activation of septal and alveolar macrophages in PRRSV infection, with septal macrophages being the major source of cytokines.","publish_time":"2010-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez-Laguna, J.; Salguero, F.

Samples were analyzed with multiplex real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) to help identify the causative viral pathogen. A total of 200 patients were enrolled in the study. A respiratory virus was detected successfully in 102 (51%) children; influenza A (H3N2) in 39.2%, influenza B in 23.5%, RSV in 15.6%, rhinovirus in 13.7%, bocavirus in 2.9%, coronavirus in 2.9%, and metapneumovirus in 0.9% of patients. Only one patient was co\u2010infected with bocavirus and influenza A virus. A statistically significant difference in the mean age of presentation was observed between the various viral pathogens (P \u003C 0.001). Patients with RSV were significantly younger whereas children infected with the influenza viruses were significantly older. Comparison of symptoms revealed that fever and headache occurred more frequently with the influenza viruses than the other viruses combined (P \u003C 0.001, \u003C0.05). Durations of symptoms such as fever, cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea were also significantly longer in the influenza group (P \u003C 0.001, \u003C0.005, \u003C0.001, \u003C0.005, respectively). Demographic analyses revealed that the school/daycare attendance was the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for influenza infection.

Beside many other viruses (HHV-8, erythrovirus B19, hepatitis A and E viruses\u2026), a special attention has been paid to emerging arbovirus diseases (West Nile virus infection, dengue, chikungunya) that threaten to occur in the French metropolitan area following the implantation in Europe of the mosquito Aedes albopictus, the main vector of dengue and chikungunya in temperate regions. Another blood-linked risk, notably in United Kingdom and France, is the prion agent responsible for the variant form of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The review is concluded by a brief overview of the measures aimed to control these emergences, including the exclusion of at-risk donors, the diagnostic tests able to detect a specific agent, the leukocyte reduction of labile blood products, and the physical or chemical treatments aiming the nonspecific inactivation of infectious agents potentially present in blood without impairing significantly the physiological properties of blood compounds.

The clinical significance of viruses detected in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear. Methods. We conducted a prospective study to identify the prevalence of 13 viruses in the upper respiratory tract of patients with CAP and concurrently enrolled asymptomatic controls with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We compared age-stratified prevalence of each virus between patients with CAP and controls and used multivariable logistic regression to calculate attributable fractions (AFs). Results. We enrolled 1024 patients with CAP and 759 controls. Detections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were substantially more common in patients with CAP of all ages than in controls (AFs near 1.0). Parainfluenza and coronaviruses were also more common among patients with CAP (AF, 0.5\u20130.75). Rhinovirus was associated with CAP among adults (AF, 0.93) but not children (AF, 0.02). Adenovirus was associated with CAP only among children \u003C2 years old (AF, 0.77). Conclusions. The probability that a virus detected with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in patients with CAP contributed to symptomatic disease varied by age group and specific virus.

About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Binqing; Xu, Xiaoling; Wei, Haiming","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffb80089bf413c89d1972ba44a38105139b34f24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154566.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02339-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290839/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory storm","severe patients of COVID","high mortality of severe COVID","inflammatory cytokine storm","inflammatory monocytes","severe complications","severe pneumonia","novel therapeutic development of severe COVID","respiratory syndrome","respiratory function","Tocilizumab treatment","acute respiratory distress syndrome","effective treatment","increased alveolar exudate","alveolar gas exchange","aberrant host immune response","autopsy","temperature","receptors","pathogenic T cells","inspiring clinical results","interleukin","intensive care unit","ICU","admission","biopsy samples analysis","ARDS","world-wide public health challenge","research","monoclonal antibody","new coronavirus","pathways","moment","exploration"],"language":"en"},

Several PtdSer receptors have been identified to enhance virus entry and we have termed this group of proteins PtdSer-mediated virus entry enhancing receptors or PVEERs. These receptors enhance entry of a range of enveloped viruses. Internalization of virions by PVEERs provides a broad mechanism of entry with little investment by the virus itself. PVEERs may allow some viruses to attach to cells, thereby making viral glycoprotein/cellular receptor interactions more probable. Alternatively, other viruses may rely entirely on PVEERs for internalization into endosomes.

The interaction with the cellular receptor and subsequent entry into the host cell differs between Old World and New World arenavirus that use \u03B1-dystoglycan or human transferring receptor 1, respectively, as main receptors. The recent development of reverse genetic systems for several arenaviruses has facilitated progress in understanding the molecular biology and cell biology of this viral family, as well as opening new approaches for the development of novel strategies to combat human pathogenic arenaviruses. On the other hand, increased availability of genetic data has allowed more detailed studies on the phylogeny and evolution of arenaviruses. As with other riboviruses, arenaviruses exist as viral quasispecies, which allow virus adaptation to rapidly changing environments. The large number of different arenavirus host reservoirs and great genetic diversity among virus species provide the bases for the emergence of new arenaviruses potentially pathogenic for humans.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Emonet, Sebastien F.; de la Torre, Juan C.; Domingo, Esteban; Sevilla, Noem\u00ED","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97ea7a298c8cc33b65c3aad7cb3e9cbc539e3c9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19460307/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134809000501; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2009.03.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134809000501","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human pathogenic arenaviruses","viral family","evolution of arenaviruses","viral species","emergence of new arenaviruses","virus species","viral quasispecies","New World arenavirus","host cell","cell biology","new approaches","human transferring receptor","important human pathogens","Arenaviridae family","rodent species","recent development of reverse genetic systems","great genetic diversity","Old World","increased availability of genetic data","virus adaptation","cellular receptor","molecular biology","large number of different arenavirus host reservoirs","development of novel strategies","tractable experimental model systems","\u03B1-dystoglycan","persistent infections","bases","bi-segmented negative-strand RNA genome","subsequent entry","detailed studies","enveloped viruses","hand","phylogeny","progress","changing environments","interaction","riboviruses","humans","main receptors"],"language":"en"},

Pathogens often have integral proteins that participate in host-cell interactions such as receptor binding and fusion with host membrane. Fusion proteins from a broad range of disparate viruses, such as paramyxovirus, HIV, ebola, and the influenza viruses share a variety of common features that are augmented by glycosylation. Each of these viruses contain multiple glycosylation sites that must be processed and modified by the host post-translational machinery to be fusogenically active. In most viruses, glycosylation plays a role in biogenesis, stability, antigenicity and infectivity. In bacteria, glycosylation events play an important role in the formation of flagellin and pili and are vitally important to adherence, attachment, infectivity and immune evasion. With the importance of glycosylation to pathogen survival, it is clear that a better understanding of the processes is needed to understand the pathogen requirement for glycosylation and to capitalize on this requirement for the development of novel therapeutics.","publish_time":"2011-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vigerust, David J.","journal":"Cent Eur J Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/face747add80abfcbb7f9447ed4f17d5d659381c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215117/; https://doi.org/10.2478/s11535-011-0050-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycosylation events","importance of glycosylation","N-linked glycosylation","influenza viruses","host of bacteria","multiple glycosylation sites","host membrane","important role","host-cell interactions","broad range of disparate viruses","infectivity","Fusion proteins","pathogen requirement","host post-translational machinery","integral proteins","pathogen survival","receptor binding","attachment","adherence","biogenesis","formation of flagellin","vital biological functions","variety of common features","pili","stability","antigenicity","HIV","ebola","paramyxovirus","immune evasion","better understanding","processes","development of novel therapeutics","Pathogens"],"language":"en"},

It was concluded that: (1) Studies on the interactions of PRRSV and its target cell, the pulmonary alveolar macrophage, are very scarce. So far, the hypothesis of impaired macrophage function has not been proven.

Variation in disease resulting from such combined PRRSV infections will probably hamper future research into disease mechanisms.

The existing Covid-19 clinical diagnostic tests will prove woefully inadequate for rapidly monitoring (at comparatively low cost) the incidence of Covid-19 community-wide. It is simply not feasible to do repeated individual testing at very large scales. Rapid community-wide monitoring could prove of immense international importance in quickly determining trends in whether the spread of Covid-19 (as well as future viral epidemics) in individual communities is increasing or decreasing. This ability is critical for better informing containment and mitigation strategies as well as for better-targeting followup diagnostic testing of individuals. This would prove even more important if SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and episodic outbreaks begin to widely occur. Fortunately, the relatively new field of sewage epidemiology (also called wastewater-based epidemiology: WBE) has been advancing steadily over the last 15 years (for example, see Choi et al, 2018; Daughton 2018), with research efforts largely concentrated in Europe. Originally geared toward determining the population-wide use of illicit drugs, this monitoring concept has since evolved to include a broad array of other types of substances in wastewater, including virus particles. So the time required for developing and implementing a wastewater monitoring approach specifically designed for SARS-CoV-2 (and Covid-19) might be greatly reduced. It is critical that governments worldwide be made aware of the important role that sewage epidemiology could play in controlling the spread of Covid-19. National agencies should encourage the development of sewage monitoring capabilities. This can be done partly by soliciting and funding grant proposals; one such example is a call for research proposals dealing with many aspects of coronavirus by the Swiss National Science Foundation (http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/coronavirus/Pages/default.aspx). Future calls for proposals focused solely on WBE might be more productive. One problem is the very uneven worldwide distribution of not just R\u0026D on WBE, but also the uneven adoption of WBE for existing purposes such as community-wide illicit drug monitoring. Some countries, such as the U.S., have little experience with the implementation of WBE. For this reason, it will be important to encourage international research collaborations. This would be the best way to ensure adoption of WBE worldwide for monitoring pandemics. Development of a rapid and economical WBE tool for monitoring status and trends of Covid-19 mass infection will encounter a number of challenges, many of which are often shared by existing WBE methods for other targets of analysis (such as chemical micropollutants). Challenges include statistically representative sampling of sewage, Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proofwhich is heterogeneous. With respect to its occurrence in sewage, viable SARS-CoV-2 probably enters mainly via shedding in the stool. Non-viable virus (and associate viral debris such as RNA fragments, mRNA, or capsid subunits) could enter sewage via stool and urine. Virus particle loadings in sewage can be quantified by targeting virus functional or structural motifs. Since the half-life of viable SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater seems to be very short, any detection method should account for both viable and non-viable particles. Degradation products (such as RNA fragments) from the virus could also be selected as targets. Detection approaches could include RT-PCR (or allied approaches) and ELISA, coupled with the Most Probable Number (MPN) method for quantifying sewage loadings of combined viable and non-viable virus particles. For each individual sewage treatment plant (STP), the virus loading levels would then be directly used to establish status and time trends. The levels could also be normalized against the populations served by each STP plant in order to rank communities with respect to their community-wide infection rates. This would facilitate rapid identification of hot spots for better-informed intervention measures and prevention of emerging clusters.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daughton, Christian","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/302e4f082da6faaaa9b53bcdaea98c30ae148326.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138149; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720316624; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720316624?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","WBE","Journal Pre-proof Journal","STP"],"locations":["Europe","U.S."],"keyphrases":["trends of Covid","existing Covid","monitoring status","spread of Covid","implementation of WBE","development of sewage monitoring capabilities","monitoring concept","monitoring pandemics","incidence of Covid","wastewater monitoring approach","Rapid community-wide monitoring","uneven adoption of WBE","existing WBE methods","Non-viable virus","half-life of viable SARS-CoV","community-wide illicit drug monitoring","virus particles","economical WBE tool","representative sampling of sewage","new field of sewage epidemiology","non-viable particles","virus functional","research proposals","wastewater-based epidemiology","Virus particle loadings","RNA fragments","existing purposes","lack of adequate diagnostic testing","repeated individual testing","example","followup diagnostic testing of individuals","ability","individual communities","important role","international research collaborations","research efforts","uneven worldwide distribution","stool","population-wide use of illicit drugs","Journal Pre-proof Journal Pre-proofwhich","future viral epidemics","clinical diagnostic tests","funding grant proposals","Future calls","National agencies","targets of analysis","number of challenges","associate viral debris","better informing containment","immense international importance","Swiss National Science Foundation","aspects of coronavirus","mRNA","types of substances","capsid subunits","mitigation strategies","mass infection","Daughton","large scales","reinfections","occurrence","continuing concerns","Choi et","broad array","Degradation products","structural motifs","detection method","episodic outbreaks","problem","little experience","low cost","best way","chemical micropollutants","urgent need","years","governments","Europe","respect","urine","shedding","reason","time","countries","attention","STP plant","levels","non-viable virus particles","individual sewage treatment plant","allied approaches","quantifying sewage loadings of combined viable","Detection approaches","better-informed intervention measures","method","MPN","rapid identification of hot spots","prevention of emerging clusters","RT-PCR","communities","community-wide infection rates","Probable Number","order","ELISA","status","time trends","populations"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: Due to the difficulty of accurate diagnosis and varying practices across the UK, there exist a number of controversial areas and non\u2010standardised practice. These will be highlighted and tackled within this article. TYPE OF REVIEW AND SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature review, last performed in September 2013, searched PubMed citing variations on the areas of controversies with \u2018tonsillitis\u2019, \u2018pharyngitis\u2019 and \u2018pharyngotonsillitis\u2019 \u2013 from 1956 to present with language restrictions. Excluded articles included those regarding sore throat after tonsillectomy and peritonsillar abscess. EVALUATION METHOD: Titles and abstracts were initially screened, and full text of potentially relevant articles obtained. The bibliographies of articles were searched for relevant references. The references were then compiled and reviewed independently by two authors (JB \u0026 TB), overseen by the senior author (EK). RESULTS: (i) Diagnosis and investigation: Use of the Centor criteria is inadequate within the secondary care setting. Blood testing is unnecessary in the majority of cases where patients do not require admission, as they are unlikely to change management. (ii) Antibiotics: Antibiotics are likely to be indicated in all those presenting to secondary ENT care, with penicillin being the antibiotic of choice for first\u2010line therapy. (iii) Corticosteroids: Moderate evidence supports the benefit of steroid administration in this patient cohort, advocating a single dose initially followed by reassessment. (iv) Analgesia: Paracetamol and NSAIDs have good evidence of action. Codeine should be used with caution in the paediatric population. (v) Reduced admission rates and early discharge: There is evidence suggesting that a trial of medical therapy prior to admission is beneficial in reducing rates of admission and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Management of acute tonsillitis within a secondary care setting largely consists of anecdotal or relatively low\u2010quality evidence. Thus, much evidence from management comes from expert opinion or practice within a primary care setting. Management across the UK can also vary greatly. An evidence\u2010based review of best practice has been presented here, but further evidence will be required in the future examining the significance of corticosteroids and antibiotic administration in this patient cohort specifically, ensuring practice is evidence based and clinically relevant.","publish_time":"2014-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bird, J.H.; Biggs, T.C.; King, E.V.","journal":"Clin Otolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2215fa0c4ee46139291f47fa43ad7f8b304c48a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418818/; https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.12299","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Service","UK","JB \u0026 TB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Moderate evidence","low\u2010quality evidence","secondary care setting","good evidence of action","admission rates","rates of admission","Management of acute tonsillitis","relevant articles","based review of best practice","secondary ENT care","primary care setting","literature review","TYPE OF REVIEW","OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW","relevant references","patient cohort","antibiotic administration","non\u2010standardised practice","Patients","Excluded articles","UK","bibliographies of articles","Antibiotics","areas of controversies","antibiotic of choice","significance of corticosteroids","line therapy","searched PubMed","benefit of steroid administration","number of controversial areas","difficulty of accurate diagnosis","trial of medical therapy","NHS","sore throat","substantial workload","Centor criteria","National Health Service","expert opinion","huge financial pressures","Use","varying practices","NSAIDs","SEARCH STRATEGY","penicillin","majority of cases","tonsillectomy","peritonsillar abscess","investigation","variations","single dose","Paracetamol","early discharge","overstretched budget","caution","TB","EVALUATION METHOD","Titles","abstracts","Blood testing","Analgesia","length of stay","future","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","senior author","paediatric population","authors","JB","EK","reassessment","pharyngitis","text","language restrictions","pharyngotonsillitis","Codeine","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From July 2008 to June 2009, we collected respiratory specimens from patients who presented ILIs symptoms in public and private clinics in Antananarivo (the capital city of Madagascar). ILIs were defined as body temperature \u226538\u00B0C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days. We screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses. We detected respiratory viruses in 235/313 (75.1%) samples. Overall influenza virus A (27.3%) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (24.8%), RSV (21.2%), adenovirus (6.1%), coronavirus OC43 (6.1%), influenza virus B (3.9%), parainfluenza virus-3 (2.9%), and parainfluenza virus-1 (2.3%). Co-infections occurred in 29.4% (69/235) of infected patients and rhinovirus was the most detected virus (27.5%). Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ILI. In this age group, compared to those \u22655 years, the risk of detecting more than one virus was higher (OR = 1.9), as was the risk of detecting of RSV (OR = 10.1) and adenovirus (OR = 4.7). While rhinovirus and adenovirus infections occurred year round, RSV, influenza virus A and coronavirus OC43 had defined period of circulation. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that respiratory viruses play an important role in ILIs in the Malagasy community, particularly in children under 5 years old. These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of outpatients with ILI and describe for the first time importance of these viruses in different age group and their period of circulation.","publish_time":"2011-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razanajatovo, Norosoa Harline; Richard, Vincent; Hoffmann, Jonathan; Reynes, Jean-Marc; Razafitrimo, Girard Marcellin; Randremanana, Rindra Vatosoa; Heraud, Jean-Michel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/258b69aa1d0bb32cf913f8124f8c053442522f6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3048401.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21390235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","ILI"],"locations":["Madagascar"],"keyphrases":["detected virus","parainfluenza virus","influenza virus B","Overall influenza virus","detectable virus","common virus","respiratory viruses","influenza surveillance","ILIs symptoms","prevalence of viruses","respiratory specimens","rhinovirus","RSV","adenovirus infections","coronavirus OC43","period of circulation","Children","years old","risk","different age group","following symptoms","time importance","infected patients","Co-infections","viral etiology of outpatients","capital city of Madagascar","multiplex real time Reverse Transcription","rhinorrhea","private clinics","Polymerase Chain Reaction assays","Antananarivo","detection","muscular pain","sore throat","important role","headache","better understanding","Malagasy community","maximum duration","body temperature","cough","study","illnesses","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","days","data","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","samples"],"language":"en"},

New viruses and devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola and Zika are emerging; diseases previously considered eradicated such as measles are reemerging, while antibiotic resistance is increasing to dangerously high levels worldwide. Increased human population and accelerated global travel make local outbreaks instant global threats. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns. Yet the threat of communicable disease varies by geographic location\u2014where you live matters. This entry examines the spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases, including the syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis, as well as new diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and dengue. It highlights the huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes while raising the alarm on the urgent need for effective global disease surveillance systems and new tools for fighting communicable diseases. Because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries, global cooperation is vital to prevent this threat to humankind.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oppong, Joseph R.","journal":"International Encyclopedia of Human Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9351fcca59ca12035699fef998742a99bdf44282.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151829.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978008102295510438X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978008102295510438X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new diseases","devastating communicable diseases","threat of communicable disease","spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases","global travel","global cooperation","human behavior","huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes","human travel interaction patterns","effective global disease surveillance systems","new tools","serious threat","New viruses","Increased human population","Ebola","humankind","Zika","syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus","local outbreaks instant global threats","urgent need","alarm","political boundaries","HIV","absence of immunity","tuberculosis","globalization","unparalleled technological advances","geographic location","antibiotic resistance","avian influenza outbreak","people","entry","Abstract","measles","high levels","Researchers","matters","dengue"],"language":"en"},

Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3\u2032 end by 3\u2032-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 3\u2032-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3\u2032 end. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation.","publish_time":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Geon-Woo; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Cho, Hee; Kim, Minwoo; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Oh, Jong-Won","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73fcc68f1fe5bf9cae21d939f459968ebed64411.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4930175.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27366906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["abundance of miR","tailed miR","proportion of miR","known functions of miR","nt prototype miR","liver-specific microRNA miR","molecular mechanism of miR","HCV core protein","HCV infection","single-nucleotide","HCV life cycle","liver development","liver specimens","single nucleotide tail","inhibited GLD","proviral activity","single ribonucleotide","inhibition of GLD","human liver biopsies","templated nucleotide additions","unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD","isomers","terminal extension","end","increased miRNA activity","regulatory role","expression regulation","crucial role","stability modulation","key proviral factor","viral RNA abundance","non-canonical cytoplasmic poly","metabolism","hepatitis C virus","high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs","essential roles","new insights","patients","dysregulation","polymerase","results","destabilization","preference","downregulation","interaction","decrease"],"language":"en"},

Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of human bocavirus1 (HBoV1) in respiratory tract samples of children. The viral load, presentation of single detection and its role as a causative agent of severe respiratory tract infections have not been thoroughly elucidated. METHODS: We investigated the presence of HBoV1 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 1229 children hospitalized for respiratory tract infections. The samples were analyzed for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR and 7 respiratory viruses by viral culture. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 652 (53.1%) of 1229 children, and two or more viruses were detected in 266 (21.6%) children. HBoV1 was detected in 127 children (10.3%), in which 66/127 (52%) of the cases were the only HBoV1 virus detected. Seasonal variation was observed with a high HBoV1 infection rate in summer. A cutoff value of 10(7) copies/mL was used to distinguish high and low HBoV1 viral loads in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. High viral loads of HBoV1 were noted predominantly in the absence of other viral agents (28/39, 71.8%) whereas there was primarily co-detection in cases of low HBoV1 viral loads (50/88, 56.8%). There were no differences in the clinical symptoms and severity between HBoV1 single detection and co-detection. In cases of HBoV1 single detection, the high viral load group was more prevalent among children with dyspnea and wheezing than was the low viral load group (42.9% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.036; 60.7% vs. 31.6%, P = 0.018). In clinical severity, a significant difference was recorded (25.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.003) between high viral load and low viral load groups. Of the HBoV1 positive patients associated with severe respiratory tract infections, 10/18 (55.6%) patients belonged to the HBoV1 high viral load group, and 7/10 (70%) patients had cases of HBoV1 single detection. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV1 at a high viral load is not frequently found in co-detection with other respiratory viruses, and a single detection with a high viral load could be an etiological agent of severe respiratory tract infections.

Therefore, the identification of the causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel. METHODS: The analytical sensitivity of three multiplex PCR assays, RespiFinder-19, RespiFinder-SMART-22 and xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay (RVP), were compared to monoplex real-time PCR with quantified standardized control material. All assays include the most common respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: To compare the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assays, samples were inoculated with 13 different quantified viruses in the range of 10(1) to 10(5) copies/ml. Concordant results were received for rhinovirus, whereas the RVP detected influenzavirus, RSV and hMPV more frequently in low concentrations. The RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 showed a higher analytical sensitivity for adenoviruses and coronaviruses, whereas the RVP was incapable to detect adenovirus and coronavirus in concentrations of 10(4) copies/ml. The RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22A did not detect influenzaviruses (10(4) copies/ml) and RSV (10(3) copies/ml). The detection of all 13 viruses in one sample was only achieved using monoplex PCR. To analyze possible competitive amplification reactions between the different viruses, samples were further inoculated with only 4 different viruses in one sample. Compared to the detection of 13 viruses in parallel, only a few differences were found. The incidence of respiratory viruses was compared in tracheal secretion (TS) samples (n = 100) of mechanically ventilated patients in winter (n = 50) and summer (n = 50). In winter, respiratory viruses were detected in 32 TS samples (64%) by RespiFinder-19, whereas the detection rate with RVP was only 22%. The most frequent viruses were adenovirus (32%) and PIV-2 (20%). Multiple infections were detected in 16 TS samples (32%) by RespiFinder-19. Fewer infections were found in summer (RespiFinder-19: 20%; RVP: 6%). All positive results were verified using monoplex PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR tests have a broad spectrum of pathogens to test at a time. Analysis of multiple inoculated samples revealed a different focus of the detected virus types by the three assays. Analysis of clinical samples showed a high concordance of detected viruses by the RespiFinder-19 compared to monoplex tests.","publish_time":"2012-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dabisch-Ruthe, Mareike; Vollmer, Tanja; Adams, Ortwin; Knabbe, Cornelius; Dreier, Jens","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ab6b5e2628c1979ae2e65f9a0f9870cb3773d61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3519643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22828244/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-163","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVP","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different viruses","RespiFinder-SMART","causative viruses","frequent viruses","different quantified viruses","incidence of respiratory viruses","multiplex PCR assays","monoplex PCR tests","TS samples","RVP","Multiplex PCR tests","monoplex real-time PCR","high concordance of detected viruses","multiplex assays","monoplex tests","copies","Analysis of multiple inoculated samples","Analysis of clinical samples","xTAG-Respiratory","respiratory tract infections","common respiratory pathogens","detected virus types","different focus","Multiple infections","higher analytical sensitivity","broad spectrum of pathogens","Fewer infections","RSV","Concordant results","positive results","winter","summer","detection rate","Virus-Panel","low concentrations","quantified standardized control material","coronaviruses","bacteria","tracheal secretion","hMPV","possible competitive amplification reactions","adenoviruses","Fast-Assay","rhinovirus","symptoms","ventilated patients","BACKGROUND","identification","range","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","differences","PIV","influenzaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Many international agencies are devoting efforts to enhance the understanding of the evolving COVID-19 outbreak on an international level, its influences, and preparedness. At present, COVID-19 appears to affect individuals through person-to-person means, like other commonly found cold or influenza viruses. It is widely known and acknowledged that viruses causing influenza peak during cold temperatures and gradually subside in the warmer temperature, owing to their seasonality. Thus, COVID-19, due to its regular flu-like symptoms, is also expected to show similar seasonality and subside as the global temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere with the onset of spring. Despite these speculations, however, the systematic analysis in the global perspective of the relation between COVID-19 spread and meteorological parameters is unavailable. Here, by analyzing the region- and city-specific affected global data and corresponding meteorological parameters, we show that there is an optimum range of temperature and UV index strongly affecting the spread and survival of the virus, whereas precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, etc. have no effect on the virus. Unavailability of pharmaceutical interventions would require greater preparedness and alert for the effective control of COVID-19. Under these conditions, the information provided here could be very helpful for the global community struggling to fight this global crisis. It is, however, important to note that the information presented here clearly lacks any physiological evidences, which may merit further investigation.

These live vaccine strains have a high safety record and can stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses. As both of these factors are critical characteristics of a good vaccine, we aimed to modify the oral PV vaccines to create a powerful vaccine vector for extraneous antigen expression. In this study, we amplified three separate fragments from the Sabin 1 virus genome by RT-PCR and cloned them into the pGEM-TEasy vector. A cassette containing engineered protease cleavage sites and a polylinker was introduced into one of these fragments (f1) in front of the translation start site. This construction facilitated the insertion of foreign genes into the vector and the subsequent release of their co-translated antigens after digestion by endogenous protease. We also placed a ribozyme (Rz) sequence between the T7 promoter and viral genomic DNA so that in vitro transcription and Rz cleavage recreated the authentic 5\u2032 end of the PV genome RNA.

Our response can build on previous efforts with virus outbreaks and lean heavily on work done on other flaviviruses such as dengue virus. We provide some suggestions of what might be possible and propose an open drug discovery effort that mobilizes global science efforts and provides leadership, which thus far has been lacking. We also provide a listing of potential resources and molecules that could be prioritized for testing as in vitro assays for ZIKV are developed. We propose also that in order to incentivize drug discovery, a neglected disease priority review voucher should be available to those who successfully develop an FDA approved treatment.

We aimed to evaluate the difference of clinical features in children with MP, according to their age and chest radiographic patterns. METHODS: The diagnosis of MP was made by examinations at both admission and discharge and by two serologic tests: the indirect microparticle agglutinin assay (\u22651:40) and the cold agglutinins titer (\u22651:32). A total of 191 children with MP were grouped by age: \u22642 years of age (29 patients), 3-5 years of age (81 patients), and \u22656 years of age (81 patients). They were also grouped by pneumonia pattern: bronchopneumonia group (96 patients) and segmental/lobar pneumonia group (95 patients). RESULTS: Eighty-six patients (45%) were seroconverters, and the others showed increased antibody titers during hospitalization. Among the three age groups, the oldest children showed the longest duration of fever, highest C-reactive protein (CRP) values, and the most severe pneumonia pattern. The patients with segmental/lobar pneumonia were older and had longer fever duration and lower white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts, compared with those with bronchopneumonia. The patient group with the most severe pulmonary lesions had the most prolonged fever, highest CRP, highest rate of seroconverters, and lowest lymphocyte counts. Thrombocytosis was observed in 8% of patients at admission, but in 33% of patients at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In MP, older children had more prolonged fever and more severe pulmonary lesions. The severity of pulmonary lesions was associated with the absence of diagnostic IgM antibodies at presentation and lymphocyte count. Short-term paired IgM serologic test may be mandatory for early and definitive diagnosis of MP.","publish_time":"2010-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Youn, You-Sook; Lee, Kyung-Yil; Hwang, Ja-Young; Rhim, Jung-Woo; Kang, Jin-Han; Lee, Joon-Sung; Kim, Ji-Chang","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/964442dc964b2d97ceef1883ce2353e866efd8c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2910686.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-10-48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20604923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae","Thrombocytosis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Eighty-six patients","years of age","lobar pneumonia group","severe pneumonia pattern","pneumoniae pneumonia","pneumonia cases","age groups","prolonged fever","older children","severe pulmonary lesions","definitive diagnosis of MP","highest CRP","oldest children","bronchopneumonia group","longest duration of fever","severity of pulmonary lesions","highest rate of seroconverters","lowest lymphocyte counts","patient group","discharge","admission","highest C-reactive protein","serologic tests","Short-term paired IgM serologic test","absence of diagnostic IgM antibodies","WBC","presentation","lower white blood cell","values","indirect microparticle agglutinin assay","examinations","difference of clinical features","increased antibody titers","hospitalization","chest radiographic patterns","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","cold agglutinins titer","community","RESULTS","METHODS","total","Thrombocytosis"],"language":"en"},

Biological weapons bring the additional dimension that these could be self-replicating, easy to manufacture and synthesized with commonly available expertise. This resulted in increasing concern about the type of research done and communicated, despite the fact that such research often has direct societal benefits, bringing the dual-use dilemma to biology. The conundrum of dual use research of concern was crystallized by the so-called \u201Cgain-of-function\u201D type of experiments in which avian influenza viruses were endowed with new properties in the laboratory such as increased virulence and the capacity for mammalian transmission. After more than a decade of intensive discussion and controversy involving biological experiments with dual-use potential, there is no consensus on the issue except for the need to carry out such experiments in the safest conditions possible. In this essay, we review the topic with the hindsight of several years and suggest that instead of prescribing prohibitions and experimental limitations the focus should be on the importance of scientific questions at hand. We posit that the importance of a scientific question for medical and scientific progress provides a benchmark to determine the acceptable level of risk in biological experimentation.","publish_time":"2018-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imperiale, Michael J.; Casadevall, Arturo","journal":"Front Bioeng Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c6dd0cad7b723b44a8b557ca0f67d1ee38d88fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5853790.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29568736/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biological experiments","type of experiments","biological experimentation","Biological weapons","biological agents","type of research","conundrum of dual use research of concern","scientific progress","importance of scientific questions","biology","new properties","altered properties","increasing concern","weapon potential","controversy","avian influenza viruses","increased virulence","focus","benchmark","acceptable level of risk","prescribing prohibitions","decade of intensive discussion","direct societal benefits","capacity","experimental limitations","problem","laboratory","additional dimension","function","mammalian transmission","topic","prospect","physics","years","disciplines","consensus","gain","need","safest conditions possible","hand","knowledge domain","hindsight","issue","century","fact","dilemma","available expertise","essay"],"language":"en"},

The VP1/2 gene in positive samples was then amplified by PCR and sequenced. A total of 49 positive HBoV cases (16.3%; mean Ct value of 34.41) were detected with the mean age being 18.1 months (range 1 month to 5 years) and the median age being 1 year of age. Children aged between 0 and 12 months had higher detection rates of HBoV (69.4%; 34/49; mean Ct = 34.45) than children from other age groups (30.6%; 15/49; mean Ct = 34.34). No significant differences were observed between HBoV Ct levels and clinical illness. The occurrence was more frequently associated with fall (38.8%; 19/49) and spring (36.7%; 18/49). All 12 sequenced isolates were identified as HBoV-1, displaying minor genetic variation compared to the Swedish reference strains ST1 and ST2 (99.1\u201399.7% nt).

A docking study involving binding between the dipeptidic lead compound 4 and 3CLpro suggested the modification of a structurally flexible P3 N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycine with various rigid P3 moieties in 4. The modifications led to the identification of several potent derivatives, including 5c\u2013k and 5n with the inhibitory activities (K i or IC50) in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Compound 5h, in particular, displayed the most potent inhibitory activity, with a K i value of 0.006 \u03BCM. This potency was 65-fold higher than the potency of the lead compound 4 (K i = 0.39 \u03BCM). In addition, the K i value of 5h was in very good agreement with the binding affinity (16 nM) observed in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A SAR study around the P3 group in the lead 4 led to the identification of a rigid indole-2-carbonyl unit as one of the best P3 moieties (5c). Further optimization showed that a methoxy substitution at the 4-position on the indole unit was highly favorable for enhancing the inhibitory potency.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thanigaimalai, Pillaiyar; Konno, Sho; Yamamoto, Takehito; Koiwai, Yuji; Taguchi, Akihiro; Takayama, Kentaro; Yakushiji, Fumika; Akaji, Kenichi; Chen, Shen-En; Naser-Tavakolian, Aurash; Sch\u00F6n, Arne; Freire, Ernesto; Hayashi, Yoshio","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c3b7432fa3849f33885eaa61bf78bd67bba6bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115411.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523413004856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23994330/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523413004856; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.07.037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ITC","SAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitory potency","P3 group","potent inhibitory activity","i value","best P3 moieties","flexible P3 N","various rigid P3 moieties","inhibitory activities","novel P3 scaffolds","dipeptidic lead compound","rigid indole","potent derivatives","indole unit","CLpro","identification","\u03BCM","binding affinity","carbonyl unit","docking study","SAR study","type inhibitors","methoxyphenyl","series of dipeptide","nM","IC50","glycine","SARS-CoV","isothermal titration calorimetry","submicromolar","position","good agreement","methoxy substitution","ITC","synthesis","nanomolar range","optimization","design","addition","modifications"],"language":"en"},

Methods Four primary outcome measures, namely the quality of life (QOL), maximum urine flow ratio (UFR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and prostate volumes, as well as four urethra-related and 35 non-urethra-related symptoms, were investigated to evaluate the effects on 31 BPH patients subjected to WM (Terazosin Hydrochloride Hytrin, THH) and 30 cases to TCM (herbal Saxifrage tablet, HST). The effects of both treatments are compared by the two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. The contributions of symptoms for four assessments are analysed by the logistic regression model and the Chow test. Results The effect of TCM is weaker than that of WM in the assessment of the IPSS score (p \u003C0.05), and both treatments are similar in the prostate volumes, the maximum UFR and the QOL assessments (p \u003E0.05), as well as in the effective number of urethra-related or non-urethra-related symptoms before and after treatment (p \u003E0.05). By comparing the linear regression models, different urethra-related and non-urethra-related symptom patterns associated with TCM and WM therapies are detected for four assessments, especially for the prostate volume assessment (p \u003C0.01). Conclusion TCM (HST) is a potentially effective treatment in improving the QOL, prostate volumes and maximum UFR for patients with BPH, though it is less effective in ameliorating the IPSS score when compared with WM (THH). The non-urethra-related symptoms experienced by BPH patients might be one of the parameters to further achieve the tailored diagnosis and treatment for BPH.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shao; Lu, Aiping; Wang, Yongyan","journal":"Complementary Therapies in Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd20fdcca922dba3eed60567c0e329b2eb9d068e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126207.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2009.10.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0965229909000636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20178875/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229909000636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","International Prostate","IPSS","WM","QOL","BPH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-urethra-related symptoms","different urethra-related","BPH patients","non-urethra-related symptom patterns","prostate volumes","effective number of urethra","maximum UFR","WM therapies","QOL assessments","IPSS score","effect of TCM","Conclusion TCM","effective treatment","International Prostate Symptom Score","prostate volume assessment","contributions of symptoms","HST","THH","symptomatic effects","treatments","maximum urine flow ratio","Western medicine","Chow test","Smirnov test","traditional Chinese medicine","logistic regression model","linear regression models","cases","benign prostatic hyperplasia","Terazosin Hydrochloride Hytrin","quality of life","herbal Saxifrage tablet","randomised controlled trial","primary outcome measures","therapeutic approaches","Summary Objectives","tailored diagnosis","Methods","sample Kolmogorov","parameters"],"language":"en"},

Citizens also have expectations about the role that health care plays in enjoying a good quality of life, by providing response systems to handle emergencies and other illness situations adequately. Among the systems required to supportdesired performance levels is a robust and resilient pharmaceutical supply chain that is free of disruption. Shortages of drugs place undue pressure on healthcare providers to devise alternative approaches to administer patient care. With climate change expected to result in increasingly severe weather patterns in the future, it is critical that logistics engineers understand the impact that a catastrophic weather event could have on supply chain disruption to facilitate the design of supply systems that are robust and resilient. This study investigates the main causal and intermediate events that led to risk propagation in, and disruption of, the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria. A causality Bayesian model is developed to depict linkages between risk events and quantify the associated cumulative risk. The quantification is further examined through different advanced techniques such as predictive inference reasoning and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses suggests that port resilience is imperative to pharmaceutical supply chain performance in the case of Puerto Rico.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawrence, Jeanne-Marie; Ibne Hossain, Niamat Ullah; Jaradat, Raed; Hamilton, Michael","journal":"Int J Disaster Risk Reduct","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14154aae29d8f51cc78f5eb3a07b77f747421554.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187851.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346504/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420919311847?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101607; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420919311847","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","U.S.","Puerto Rico"],"keyphrases":["supply chain disruption","pharmaceutical supply chain performance","resilient pharmaceutical supply chain","design of supply systems","risk events","health care plays","health care sector","health risks","patient care","free of disruption","citizens","risk propagation","response systems","associated cumulative risk","intermediate events","performance levels","critical infrastructure","catastrophic weather event","severe weather patterns","predictive inference reasoning","healthcare providers","impact","terrorism","port resilience","undue pressure","alternative approaches","different advanced techniques","homeland security","analyses","future","role","good quality of life","natural disasters","case of Puerto Rico","Shortages of drugs","sensitivity analysis","main causal","logistics engineers","emergencies","linkages","United States government","expectations","Hurricane Maria","study","epidemics","causality Bayesian model","general interpretation","illness situations","quantification"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we first summarize the ubiquitination events in PRRs-mediated signaling that is triggered by viral nucleic acid and then focus on host and viral deubiquitinating enzymes-mediated regulation of virus-triggered signaling that modulates the activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03BAB and subsequent induction of type I IFNs.","publish_time":"2015-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Dandan; Zhong, Bo","journal":"Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4599e6e19a7b16de403c9fe55ac93a382eefd80d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109689.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/abbs/gmu133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25651846/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-triggered PRRs","NF-\u03BAB","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","subsequent induction of type","activation of IRF3","IFNs","viral deubiquitinating enzymes-mediated regulation of virus","regulatory factor","essential role","activation of interferon","ubiquitination events","reversible process of ubiquitination","viral nucleic acid","Host pattern-recognition receptors","pathogen","mediating","interferons","Posttranslational modification of proteins","molecular patterns","viruses","Deubiquitination","series","cascades","review"],"language":"en"},

Anorexia occurs during such viral infection. But the pattern of the decrease in food intake (a decrease in either meal size and meal number or both) during spontaneous viral infection has not been previously characterized. We observed the onset of anorexia and an abnormal feeding pattern during an opportunistic SDA viral infection in our rat colony. We thus studied seven male rats. Before the viral infection there was a positive association between food intake and meal number (P\u003C.05). After infection food intake decreased by 68%. This occurred via a significant decrease in meal size (by 69%) (P\u003C.05); and a nonsignificant decrease in meal number (P=.71). This pattern of decreased food intake is similar to that occurring during indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, where we previously measured an increase in plasma tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1. Anorexia in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide administration, which is also linked to plasma TNF-\u03B1, is however, caused only via a decrease in meal number. The differences in the decrease in the feeding pattern between the SDA viral and a bacterial infection suggest that factors other than TNF-\u03B1 alone play a significant role in the mechanism of anorexia during a viral infection.","publish_time":"2001-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Tomoi; Meguid, Michael M; Quinn, Robert H; Zhang, Lihua; Chen, Chung","journal":"Physiology \u0026 Behavior","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f42b08ab6da4dab242aa8c1e9d62609a337233e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127412.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938401004206; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031938401004206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection food intake","spontaneous viral infection","meal number","bacterial infection","opportunistic SDA viral infection","contagious common viral infection","meal size","pattern of decreased food intake","nonsignificant decrease","plasma TNF-\u03B1","mechanism of anorexia","onset of anorexia","abnormal feeding pattern","significant role","male rats","bacterial lipopolysaccharide administration","plasma tumor-necrosis factor","positive association","rat colony","increase","response","mumps","factors","indomethacin","humans","ulcerative ileitis","Abstract Sialodacryoadenitis","differences"],"language":"en"},

Translation of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in tombusviruses is mediated using this strategy and we have investigated this process using a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our results indicate that readthrough generating the RdRp requires a novel long-range RNA-RNA interaction, spanning a distance of \u223C3.5 kb, which occurs between a large RNA stem-loop located 3\u0027-proximal to the stop codon and an RNA replication structure termed RIV at the 3\u0027-end of the viral genome. Interestingly, this long-distance RNA-RNA interaction is modulated by mutually-exclusive RNA structures in RIV that represent a type of RNA switch. Moreover, a different long-range RNA-RNA interaction that was previously shown to be necessary for viral RNA replicase assembly was also required for efficient readthrough production of the RdRp. Accordingly, multiple replication-associated RNA elements are involved in modulating the readthrough event in tombusviruses and we propose an integrated mechanistic model to describe how this regulatory network could be advantageous by (i) providing a quality control system for culling truncated viral genomes at an early stage in the replication process, (ii) mediating cis-preferential replication of viral genomes, and (iii) coordinating translational readthrough of the RdRp with viral genome replication. Based on comparative sequence analysis and experimental data, basic elements of this regulatory model extend to other members of Tombusviridae, as well as to viruses outside of this family.","publish_time":"2011-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cimino, Peter A.; Nicholson, Beth L.; Wu, Baodong; Xu, Wei; White, K.

However, apoptosis was not completely prevented by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that there may be a caspase-independent pathway involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) on TGEV-induced apoptotic pathway. Results indicated that AIF translocated from the mitochondria to nucleus during TGEV infection, and the AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (NP), significantly attenuated the apoptosis. In addition, the translocation of AIF was inhibited by Veliparib (ABT-888), an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). And the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC), redistributed AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus in TGEV-infected cells. Moreover, the protein levels in nucleus and the mRNA levels of AIF were inhibited in the presence of the p53 inhibitor, pi\uFB01thrin-\u03B1 (PFT-\u03B1) or in TGEV-infected p53\u2212/\u2212cells. Furthermore, TGEV-induced apoptosis was blocked by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, NP, ABT-888, PDTC, PFT-\u03B1, to treat PK-15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the p53- and ROS-mediated AIF pathway and caspase-dependent pathway were involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis.","publish_time":"2018-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"DING, Li; LI, Jiawei; LI, Weihao; FANG, Zhenhua; LI, Na; WU, Shannan; LI, Jiangyue; HONG, Meiling","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b16cc9a6b9fa37d7b10f17e8b1d2c6dff8783911.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6261820.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.18-0104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30249935/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIF","NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-induced apoptosis","AIF inhibitor","TGEV-induced cell apoptosis","TGEV infection","TGEV-infected p53","TGEV-infected cells","redistributed AIF","translocation of AIF","regulation of apoptosis","ROS-mediated AIF pathway","p53 inhibitor","mRNA levels of AIF","nucleus","caspase-dependent pathway","caspase-independent pathway","inhibitor of poly","caspase inhibitor Z-VAD","PFT-\u03B1","apoptotic pathway","pi\uFB01thrin-\u03B1","NP","PDTC","mitochondria","ABT","Results","protein levels","caspases inhibitors","scavenger","pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic","FMK","ADP-ribose","reactive oxygen species","polymerase","N-phenylmaleimide","presence","factor","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","PARP","Veliparib","PK","combination","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnosis is critical for the implementation of efficient control strategies before and during PEDV and PDCoV outbreaks. Insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) on the portable POCKIT\u2122 device is user friendly for on-site pathogen detection. In the present study, a singleplex PEDV RT-iiPCR, a singleplex PDCoV RT-iiPCR, and a duplex PEDV/PDCoV real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) commercial reagents targeting the M gene were compared to an N gene-based PEDV rRT-PCR and an M gene-based PDCoV rRT-PCR that were previously published and used as reference PCRs. All PCR assays were highly specific and did not cross react with other porcine enteric pathogens. Analytical sensitivities of the PEDV RT-iiPCR, PDCoV RT-iiPCR and duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR were determined using in vitro transcribed RNA as well as viral RNA extracted from ten-fold serial dilutions of PEDV and PDCoV cell culture isolates. Performance of each PCR assay was further evaluated using 170 clinical samples (86 fecal swabs, 24 feces, 19 intestines, and 41 oral fluids). Compared to the reference PEDV rRT-PCR, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the PEDV RT-iiPCR were 97.73%, 98.78%, and 98.24%, respectively, and those of the duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR were 98.86%, 96.34%, and 97.65%, respectively. Compared to the reference PDCoV rRT-PCR, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the PDCoV RT-iiPCR were 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and those of the PEDV/PDCoV duplex rRT-PCR were 96.34%, 100%, and 98.24%, respectively. Overall, all three new PCR assays were comparable to the reference rRT-PCRs for detection of PEDV and/or PDCoV. The PEDV and PDCoV RT-iiPCRs are potentially useful tools for on-site detection and the duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR provides a convenient method to simultaneously detect the two viruses and differentiate PEDV from PDCoV.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jianqiang; Tsai, Yun-Long; Lee, Pei-Yu Alison; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Yan; Chiang, Cheng-Jen; Shen, Yu-Han; Li, Fu-Chun; Chang, Hsiao-Fen Grace; Gauger, Phillip C.; Harmon, Karen M.; Wang, Hwa-Tang Thomas","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c58715798b7ae050186df99882c4f62fd73c2916.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113669.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.03.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415301075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27060624/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415301075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PCR","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV duplex rRT-PCR","reference PEDV rRT-PCR","reference PDCoV rRT-PCR","duplex PEDV","PDCoV real-time RT-PCR","detection of PEDV","gene-based PDCoV rRT-PCR","PDCoV outbreaks","PDCoV RT-iiPCRs","singleplex PEDV RT-iiPCR","singleplex PDCoV RT-iiPCR","N gene-based PEDV rRT-PCR","new PCR assays","Insulated isothermal PCR","reference rRT-PCRs","fold serial dilutions of PEDV","PDCoV cell culture isolates","reference PCRs","on-site detection","porcine deltacoronavirus","on-site pathogen detection","accuracy","specificity","sensitivity","porcine enteric pathogens","viral RNA","transcribed RNA","Abstract Recent outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","user friendly","multiple countries","device","significant economic losses","useful tools","serious challenge","portable POCKIT","implementation of efficient control strategies","fecal swabs","commercial reagents","intestines","present study","convenient method","clinical samples","Analytical sensitivities","feces","swine industry","Rapid diagnosis","viruses","oral fluids","Performance"],"language":"en"},

Most severe viral disease outbreaks occur in developing regions where health conditions are poor. With increased international travel and business, the possibility of eventually transmitting infectious viruses between different countries is increasing. The most effective approach in preventing viral diseases is vaccination. However, vaccines are not currently available for numerous viral diseases. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are engineered vaccine candidates that have been studied for decades. VLPs are constructed by viral protein expression in various expression systems that promote the selfassembly of proteins into structures resembling virus particles. VLPs have antigenicity similar to that of the native virus, but are non-infectious as they lack key viral genetic material. VLP vaccines have attracted considerable research interest because they offer several advantages over traditional vaccines. Studies have shown that VLP vaccines can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, which may offer effective antiviral protection. Here we review recent developments with VLP-based vaccines for several highly virulent emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases. The infectious agents discussed include RNA viruses from different virus families, such as the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Togaviridae families.","publish_time":"2016-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jinliang; Dai, Shiyu; Wang, Manli; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin; Deng, Fei","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3fe4fb2909b5d4ca97c2a19c69bb3ed1102a555.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27405928/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-016-3756-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VLP vaccines","numerous viral diseases","Emerging infectious diseases","infectious viruses","VLP-based vaccines","virus particles","VLPs","traditional vaccines","viral protein expression","different virus families","infectious agents","native virus","severe viral disease outbreaks","key viral genetic material","RNA viruses","human health","health conditions","Togaviridae families","effective approach","different countries","various expression systems","effective antiviral protection","developing regions","Filoviridae","Coronaviridae","Orthomyxoviridae","major threats","selfassembly of proteins","Caliciviridae","Flaviviridae","Paramyxoviridae","possibility","Arenaviridae","cellular immune responses","business","Bunyaviridae","engineered vaccine candidates","structures","recent developments","increased international travel","antigenicity similar","considerable research","advantages","vaccination","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Most attention has been paid to bacterial infection and potential underlying defects in innate immunity. Bacterial biofilm is present in most patients with CRS undergoing surgical intervention, and its presence is associated with more severe disease and worse surgical outcomes. A role for viral or fungal infection in patients with CRS is less clear. There is no evidence for a primary defect in mucociliary clearance in most patients with CRS. Decreased levels of certain antimicrobial proteins, most notably lactoferrin, have been found in sinus secretions, whereas levels of other antimicrobial proteins have been found to be normal. No primary defects in Toll-like receptors have been found in patients with CRS, although a 50% reduced expression of Toll-like receptor 9 was reported in patients with recalcitrant nasal polyps. A polymorphism in a bitter taste receptor was recently associated with refractory CRS and persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. A downregulation of innate immunity by maladaptive TH2 tissue inflammation has also been described in patients with recalcitrant nasal polyps, suggesting a link to persistent infection.

In this work, an active C-terminal His-tagged UCH from Drosophila melanogaster (DmUCH) was produced as a secretory form in a recombinant strain of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The production of recombinant DmUCH by Muts strain was much higher than that by Mut\u002B strain, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis. When expression was induced at pH 6.0 in a BMMY/methanol medium, the concentration of recombinant DmUCH reached 210mgl\u22121. With the (His)6-tag, the recombinant DmUCH was easily purified by Ni-NTA chromatography and 18mg pure active DmUCH were obtained from 100ml culture broth supernatant. Ubiquitin\u2013magainin fusion protein was efficiently cleaved by DmUCH, yielding recombinant magainin with high antimicrobial activity. After removing the contaminants by Ni-NTA chromatography, recombinant magainin was purified to homogeneity easily by reversed-phase HPLC. Analysis of the recombinant magainin by ESI-MS showed that the molecular weight of the purified recombinant magainin was 2465Da, which perfectly matches the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. The result of mass spectrometry confirmed that the purified His-tagged DmUCH can recognize the ubiquitin\u2013magainin fusion protein and cleave it at the carboxyl terminus of ubquitin precisely. Our results showed that P. pastoris is a robust system to express the secreted form of DmUCH.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Feng-liang; Xu, Xiao-xia; Yu, Xiao-qiang; Ren, Shun-xiang","journal":"Protein Expression and Purification","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7447d3d1c60fbae9063f9f6d931c07ac43151d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128749.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592808002246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18817875/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046592808002246; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2008.08.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ubiquitin","Drosophila"],"organizations":["HPLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified recombinant magainin","concentration of recombinant DmUCH","production of recombinant DmUCH","recombinant strain","magainin fusion protein","secreted form of DmUCH","pure active DmUCH","cleavage of ubiquitin fusion proteins","Abstract Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases","Muts strain","Ni-NTA chromatography","proteolytic processing of polymeric ubiquitin","active C-terminal","high specificity","secretory form","UCHs useful enzymes","high antimicrobial activity","carboxyl terminus of ubquitin","Western blot analysis","result of mass spectrometry","methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris","recognition site","molecular weight","methanol medium","ESI-MS","BMMY","robust system","homogeneity","Drosophila melanogaster","amino acid sequence","work","contaminants","mgl","culture broth supernatant","phase HPLC","tag","expression","results"],"language":"en"},

Estimating an R0 of Covid-19 at around 3 justified postponing non-urgent face-to-face consultations and expanding the use of teleconsultation in order to limit the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients or health workers and comply with the lockdown. The health authority recommends cancellation of all medical or surgical activities which are not urgent as long as this does not involve a loss of chance for the patient. The purpose of this cancellation is to significantly increase critical care capacity, prioritize the reception of patients with Covid-19, prioritize the allocation of staff and provision of the equipment necessary for their medical or surgical management, and contribute to the smooth running of downstream critical care within their establishment. Another goal is to reduce the risks of patient contamination within healthcare facilities. This document provides guidance on how to proceed with and adapt ENT surgery in the current pandemic context, as well as on the management of postponed operations.

The outcomes of FeLV infection in domestic cats vary according to host susceptibility, virus strain, and infectious challenge dose. Jaguarundis (Puma yagouaroundi) are small wild felids from South and Central America. We previously reported on FeLV infections in jaguarundis. We hypothesized here that the outcomes of FeLV infection in P. yagouaroundi mimic those observed in domestic cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the population of jaguarundis at Funda\u00E7\u00E3o Parque Zool\u00F3gico de S\u00E3o Paulo for natural FeLV infection and resulting outcomes. METHODS: We investigated the jaguarundis using serological and molecular methods and monitored them for FeLV-related diseases for 5 years. We retrieved relevant biological and clinical information for the entire population of 23 jaguarundis held at zoo. Post-mortem findings from necropsies were recorded and histopathological and immunohistopathological analyses were performed. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed for FeLV-positive samples. For sample prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare frequencies between infected and uninfected animals. P-values \u003C0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: In total, we detected evidence of FeLV exposure in four out of 23 animals (17%; 95% CI 5\u201339%). No endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) sequences were detected. An intestinal B-cell lymphoma in one jaguarundi was not associated with FeLV. Two jaguarundis presented FeLV test results consistent with an abortive FeLV infection with seroconversion, and two other jaguarundis had results consistent with a progressive infection and potentially FeLV-associated clinical disorders and post-mortem changes. Phylogenetic analysis of env revealed the presence of FeLV-A, a common origin of the virus in both animals (100% identity) and the closest similarity to FeLV-FAIDS and FeLV-3281 (98.4% identity), originally isolated from cats in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of progressive and abortive FeLV infection outcomes in jaguarundis, and domestic cats were probably the source of infection in these jaguarundis.","publish_time":"2017-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Filoni, Claudia; Helfer-Hungerbuehler, A.

We aimed to explore the cytokine expression profiles in hospitalized children with CoV-CNS and CoV-respiratory tract infections. METHODS: A total of 183 and 236 hospitalized children with acute encephalitis-like syndrome and respiratory tract infection, respectively, were screened for anti-CoV IgM antibodies. The expression profiles of multiple cytokines were determined in CoV-positive patients. RESULTS: Anti-CoV IgM antibodies were detected in 22/183 (12.02%) and 26/236 (11.02%) patients with acute encephalitis-like syndrome and respiratory tract infection, respectively. Cytokine analysis revealed that the level of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in both CoV-CNS and CoV-respiratory tract infection compared with healthy controls. Additionally, the serum level of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was significantly higher in CoV-CNS infection than in CoV-respiratory tract infection. In patients with CoV-CNS infection, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and GM-CSF were significantly higher in their cerebrospinal fluid samples than in matched serum samples. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a high incidence of CoV infection in hospitalized children, especially with CNS illness.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and complete polyprotein showed that the virus belonged to sub-genotype VIg of class II NDV and is most closely related to pigeon NDVs in Egypt in the same year. The present study is the first that demonstrated isolation of NDV in dromedaries. Further study is warranted to investigate the relationship between NDV infection and abortion.","publish_time":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teng, Jade Lee Lee; Wernery, Ulrich; Lee, Hwei Huih; Joseph, Sunitha; Fung, Joshua; Elizabeth, Shyna Korah; Yeong, Kai Yan; Kinne, Joerg; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Lau, Susanna Kar Pui; Woo, Patrick Chiu Yat","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/821adc5f0139622999cf4d6a2f622b51b15a07bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6783818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480604/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11090810","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NDV outbreak","isolation of NDV","NDV infections","dromedary NDV genome","pigeon farm","present study","aborted dromedary fetus","dairy camel farm","pigeon NDVs","Genome analysis","infected birds","domestic birds","Phylogenetic analysis","hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein","Newcastle disease virus","nucleotide sequences of fusion protein","morbidities","nasal swab","close proximity","mother","conjunctivitis","HN","mortalities","sub-genotype VIg of class","Vero cells","complete polyprotein","influenza","exposure","time","Dubai","relationship","humans","Egypt","abortion","lot of pigeons","generation sequencing","symptoms","important features","year","mammals","dromedaries"],"language":"en"},

The replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus (PanAd3-RSV) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA-RSV) vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in young healthy adults. Here we report an extension to this first-in-man vaccine trial to include healthy older adults aged 60\u201375 years. METHODS: We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of MVA-RSV given by intra-muscular (IM) injection (n = 6), two doses of IM PanAd3-RSV given 4-weeks apart (n = 6), IM PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), intra-nasal (IN) spray of PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), or no vaccine (n = 6). Safety measures included all adverse events within one week of vaccination and blood monitoring. Immunogenicity measures included serum antibody responses (RSV- and PanAd3-neutralising antibody titres measured by plaque-reduction neutralisation and SEAP assays, respectively), peripheral B-cell immune responses (frequencies of F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells and memory B-cells by ex vivo and cultured dual-colour ELISpot assays respectively), and peripheral RSV-specific T-cell immune responses (frequencies of IFN\u03B3-producing T-cells by ex vivo ELISpot and CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B/Tfh-like cell frequencies by ICS/FACS assay). RESULTS: The vaccines were safe and well tolerated. Compared with each individual baseline immunity the mean fold-changes in serum RSV-neutralising antibody, appearance and magnitude of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs and expansion of CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B IFN\u03B3-producing T-cells in peripheral circulation were comparable to the results seen from younger healthy adults who received the same vaccine combination and dose. There were little/no IgA memory B-cell responses in younger and older adults. Expansion of IFN\u03B3-producing T-cells was most marked in older adults following IM prime, with balanced CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell responses. The RSV-specific immune responses to vaccination did not appear to be attenuated in the presence of PanAd3 (vector) neutralising antibody. CONCLUSIONS: PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV was safe and immunogenic in older adults and the parallel induction of RSV-specific humoral and cellular immunity merits further assessment in providing protection from severe disease.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, Christopher A.; Sande, Charles J.; Scarselli, Elisa; Capone, Stefania; Vitelli, Alessandra; Nicosia, Alfredo; Silva-Reyes, Laura; Thompson, Amber J.; de Lara, Catherine M.; Taylor, Kathryn S.; Haworth, Kathryn; Hutchings, Claire L.; Cargill, Tamsin; Angus, Brian; Klenerman, Paul; Pollard, Andrew J.","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bb973611fdfdbfb74d3edf94324fa9f723a8965.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172982.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445319300386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742894/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445319300386; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2019.02.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IM","SEAP","ICS/FACS"],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["IM PanAd3-RSV prime","RSV-specific immune responses","doses of IM PanAd3-RSV","IM MVA-RSV boost","serum RSV-neutralising antibody","peripheral RSV-specific T-cell immune responses","parallel induction of RSV","T cell responses","T-cells","IM prime","serum antibody responses","healthy older adults","cell frequencies","peripheral B-cell immune responses","PanAd3-neutralising antibody titres","spray of PanAd3","presence of PanAd3","IgA memory B-cell responses","younger healthy adults","specific IgG","IgA antibody secreting cells","memory B-cells","young healthy adults","frequencies of IFN\u03B3","CD8","weeks","single dose of MVA","frequencies of F","expansion of CD4","Expansion of IFN\u03B3","IgA ASCs","peripheral circulation","balanced CD4","RESULTS","Immunogenicity measures","severe disease","Safety measures","vaccine combination","vaccines","Respiratory syncytial virus","man vaccine trial","magnitude of F","SEAP assays","week of vaccination","respiratory infection","intra-nasal","cultured dual-colour ELISpot assays","cellular immunity merits","individual baseline immunity","modified vaccinia virus Ankara","mean fold-changes","assessment","appearance","plaque-reduction neutralisation","particular risk","infants","elderly","adverse events","protection","ICS","Tfh","replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus","world","FACS assay","OBJECTIVES","injection","vector","blood monitoring","death","CONCLUSIONS","years","METHODS","extension"],"language":"en"},

Domestic transmission of the Guinea strain associated with the outbreak occurred mainly in six African countries, and international transmission was reported in four countries. Outbreak management was limited by the inability to rapidly diagnose infected cases. A further fifteen countries in Africa are predicted to be at risk of Ebolavirus outbreaks in the future as a consequence of climate change and urbanization. Early detection of cases and reduction of transmission rates is critical to prevent and manage future severe outbreaks. We designed a rapid assay for detection of Ebolavirus using recombinase polymerase amplification, a rapid isothermal amplification technology that can be combined with portable lateral flow detection technology. The developed rapid assay operates in 30 min and was comparable with real-time TaqMan\u2122 PCR. METHODS: Designed, screened, selected and optimized oligonucleotides using the NP coding region from Ebola Zaire virus (Guinea strain). We determined the analytical sensitivity of our Ebola rapid molecular test by testing selected primers and probe with tenfold serial dilutions (1.34 \u00D7 10(10\u2212) 1.34 \u00D7 10(1) copies/\u03BCL) of cloned NP gene from Mayinga strain of Zaire ebolavirus in pCAGGS vector, and serially diluted cultured Ebolavirus as established by real-time TaqMan\u2122 PCR that was performed using ABI7500 in Fast Mode. We tested extracted and reverse transcribed RNA from cultured Zaire ebolavirus strains \u2013 Mayinga, Gueckedou C05, Gueckedou C07, Makona, Kissidougou and Kiwit. We determined the analytical specificity of our assay with related viruses: Marburg, Ebola Reston and Ebola Sudan. We further tested for Dengue virus 1\u20134, Plasmodium falciparum and West Nile Virus (Kunjin strain). RESULTS: The assay had a detection limit of 134 copies per \u03BCL of plasmid containing the NP gene of Ebolavirus Mayinga, and cultured Ebolavirus and was highly specific for the Zaire ebolavirus species, including the Guinea strain responsible for the 2014/2015 outbreak. The assay did not detect related viruses like Marburg, Reston, or Sudan viruses, and other pathogens likely to be isolated from clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our assay could be suitable for implementation in district and primary health laboratories, as only a heating block and centrifuge is required for operation. The technique could provide a pathway for rapid screening of patients and animals for improved management of outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, Ameh S.; Todd, Shawn; Pollak, Nina M.; Marsh, Glenn A.; Macdonald, Joanne","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d71ba68f8d3e03e0a16d0ab59675786bae69b6ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5914028.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685158/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-0985-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":["Africa","Zaire","Ebola Sudan","Guinea"],"keyphrases":["detection of Ebolavirus","Mayinga strain of Zaire ebolavirus","Zaire ebolavirus species","diluted cultured Ebolavirus","risk of Ebolavirus outbreaks","cultured Zaire ebolavirus strains","NP gene of Ebolavirus Mayinga","Guinea strain","developed rapid assay","Ebola Zaire virus","Ebola Reston","Ebola Sudan","Kunjin strain","Outbreak management","Ebola rapid molecular test","Early detection of cases","rapid isothermal amplification technology","related viruses","Sudan viruses","detection limit","rapid screening of patients","cloned NP gene","Marburg","Dengue virus","international transmission","Domestic transmission","real-time TaqMan","future severe outbreaks","copies","improved management of outbreaks","infected cases","PCR","African countries","portable lateral flow detection technology","NP coding region","West Nile Virus","reduction of transmission rates","Gueckedou C07","Gueckedou C05","selected primers","\u03BCL of plasmid","analytical sensitivity","analytical specificity","reported deaths","recombinase polymerase amplification","pCAGGS vector","probe","Makona","implementation","Plasmodium falciparum","animals","reverse transcribed RNA","primary health laboratories","district","tenfold serial dilutions","pathogens likely","consequence of climate change","heating block","Kissidougou","optimized oligonucleotides","pathway","inability","centrifuge","urbanization","Kiwit","ABI7500","clinical samples","Fast Mode","operation","technique","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Up to February 11, 2020, it is reported that over 70,000 persons have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China [2]. The COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a spectrum of clinical severity [3,4,5]. Some patients are asymptomatic or have merely mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, SARS-CoV-2 causes pneumonia that can be severe and characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and acute respiratory injury. It is estimated that approximately 20% of patients are developing severe respiratory illness, with the overall mortality around 2.3% [2]. Thereby, it is critical to identify individuals who confer intrinsic susceptibility to become severe or even critically ill upon infection, for the purposes of prevention and treatment, especially when there is no drug directly targeting at SARS-CoV-2 that has been proven to be clinically effective. In the study, we explored potential host risk factors associated with severe cases at admission in a retrospective cohort of 487 patients in Zhejiang Province of China and attempt to establish a score system to identify high-risk individuals. We reviewed medical records, laboratory findings, and pulmonary CT scan of each patient with COVID-19, provided by the local health authority and inputted into a pre-specified electronic data collection form. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 17, 2020. The primary endpoint was occurrence of death and severe cases. A total of 487 COVID-19 patients were included for analysis, with 49 (10.1%) severe cases at admission. As shown in Table 1, severe cases are elderly (56 (17) vs. 45 (19), P \u003C 0.001), with more male (73.5% vs. 50.9%, P = 0.003). They have a higher incidence of hypertension (53.1% vs. 16.7%, P \u003C 0.001), diabetes (14.3% vs. 5.0%, P = 0.009), cardiovascular diseases (8.2% vs. 1.6%, P = 0.003), and malignancy (4.1% vs. 0.7%, P = 0.025), and less exposure to epidemic area (49.0% vs. 65.1%, P = 0.027), but more infected family members (P = 0.031).

The oral route is problematic in cattle and other ruminants where antigen degradation in the rumen is likely, prior to transit to the intestine. On the other hand, rumination can be exploited for exposure of nasopharyngeal tissues during cudding if vaccine antigen is expressed by a fibrous feed like alfalfa. An increase in anti-leukotoxin (Lkt) IgA was demonstrated in nasal secretions of calves following feeding of alfalfa expressing a truncated Lkt50 from Mannheimia haemolytica, and there is evidence suggesting that such vaccination may protect against experimentally induced pneumonia. Intranasal vaccination is an alternative approach for use in pre-ruminating calves. Intranasal administration of ISCOMs carrying soluble antigens of M. haemolytica, including native Lkt, induced Lkt specific IgA in nasal secretions after vaccination at 4 and 6 weeks of age. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of the same vaccine induced Lkt specific IgG in both serum and nasal secretions, whereas s.c. administration of a commercial M. haemolytica vaccine did not. Regardless of the vaccination strategy employed it is difficult to assess the immunogenicity of mucosally administered vaccines because production of secreted antibodies tends to be transient, and they do not persist on the mucosal surface in the absence of ongoing antigenic stimulation. An additional challenge is demonstration of vaccine efficacy in response to experimental infection. Protection of the mucosally vaccinated animal will most probably result from recall response, which may not amplify sufficiently to counter the effects of experimental pulmonary delivery of a large bolus of virulent bacteria, even though the response would suffice over the more prolonged and gradual infection that occurs in natural induction of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shewen, P.

The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society COVID-19 airway management guidelines. The primary outcome was intubation time; secondary outcomes included first-pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment. All intubations were performed by specialist (consultant) anaesthetists and video recorded. Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations. Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box ((median (IQR [range])) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6]) seconds vs. 82.1(45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0]) seconds, p=0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4(43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2]) seconds, p=0.008). No intubations without a box took more than one minute, whereas 14 (58%) intubations with a box took over one minute and 4 (17%) took over two minutes (including one failure). Without an aerosol box, all anaesthetists obtained first-pass success. With the early-generation and latest-generation boxes, 9 (75%) and 10 (83%) participants obtained first-pass success respectively. One breach of personal protective equipment occurred using the early-generation box and seven breaches occurred using the latest-generation box. Aerosol boxes may increase intubation times and therefore expose patients to the risk of hypoxia.

The first ORF is translated from the full-length genomic mRNA while the remaining ORFs are translated from eight subgeomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we designed small interference RNAs (siRNAs) targeting sgRNA 2, 3 and 7 and tested their efficiency and specificity in silencing the protein translated from the targeted sgRNA. Our results demonstrated that siRNA 7 could inhibit sgRNA 7, which showed 19/19 nucleotides (nt) matching, and sgRNA 8, which showed 18/19nt matching; but, it did not inhibit the full-length genomic mRNA which showed 17/19nt matching. Overall, each of the siRNAs can inhibit the targeted sgRNA without affecting the full-length genomic mRNA or the other sgRNAs that showed mismatch of two or more nt. Thus, siRNA could be designed so as to knockdown the expression of viral protein(s) from a targeted sgRNA during viral infection, thereby allowing the contribution of individual viral proteins to viral infection to be delineated. When Vero E6 cells expressing siRNA 2, 3 or 7 were infected with SARS-CoV, a significant reduction in the yield of progeny virus was observed. Indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that in the infected cells expressing each of the siRNAs, there was aspecific silencing of S, 3a and 7a, respectively, but the expression of nucleocapsid protein was not affected.

Multiple studies suggest that dromedary camels are a source for human MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV-specific antibodies have been detected in the serum of dromedary camels across Northern Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula. Israel\u2019s geographic location places Israel at risk for MERS-CoV infection. To date, MERS-CoV-related illness has not been reported and the burden of MERS-CoV infection in the Israeli population is unknown. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in Israeli dromedary camels is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MERS-CoV seropositivity in dromedary camels in Israel. The prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in Israeli camels was examined in 71 camel sera collected from four farms across Israel by MERS-CoV-specific microneutralization (Mnt) assay and confirmed by MERS-CoV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Although this study cannot rule out potential antibody cross-reactivity by IFA, the presence of bovine coronavirus-specific antibodies do not appear to impact detection of MERS-CoV antibodies by Mnt. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detectable in 51 (71.8%) camel sera, and no association was observed between the presence of neutralizing antibodies and camel age or gender. These findings extend the known range of MERS-CoV circulation in Middle Eastern camels. The high rate of MERS-CoV-specific antibody seropositivity in dromedary camels in the absence of any reported human MERS cases suggests that there is still much to be learned about the dynamics of camel-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harcourt, Jennifer L.; Rudoler, Nir; Tamin, Azaibi; Leshem, Eyal; Rasis, Michal; Giladi, Michael; Haynes, Lia M.","journal":"Zoonoses and Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4bccb62611c61291d731e46f49caa96e542ab70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6274617.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12482; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/zph.12482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Middle Eastern","Saudi Arabia","Northern Africa","Israel"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV cases","CoV antibodies","human MERS-CoV infection","CoV-specific antibodies","CoV seropositivity","detection of MERS","burden of MERS","seroprevalence of MERS","CoV circulation","human transmission of MERS","CoV-specific antibody seropositivity","known range of MERS","high rate of MERS","reported human MERS cases","Israeli dromedary camels","Israeli camels","serum of dromedary camels","presence of neutralizing antibodies","presence of bovine coronavirus-specific antibodies","specific microneutralization","Middle Eastern camels","specific immunofluorescence assay","camel sera","camel age","dynamics of camel","IFA","Israeli population","Mnt","study","Israel\u2019s geographic location places Israel","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","potential antibody cross-reactivity","risk","absence","Northern Africa","source","farms","gender","related illness","Arabian Peninsula","findings","association","Multiple studies","date","laboratory","Saudi Arabia","objective"],"language":"en"},

The question is what is the fate of the infected cells? All eukaryotic cells can \u201Csense\u201D viral infections and exhibit defence strategies to oppose viral replication and spread. This often leads to the elimination of the infected cells by programmed cell death or apoptosis. This \u201Csacrifice\u201D of infected cells represents the most primordial response of multicellular organisms to viruses. Subverting host cell apoptosis, at least for some time, is therefore a crucial strategy of viruses to ensure their replication, the production of essential viral proteins, virus assembly and the spreading to new hosts. For that reason many viruses harbor apoptosis inhibitory genes, which once inside infected cells are expressed to circumvent apoptosis induction during the virus reproduction phase. On the other hand, viruses can take advantage of stimulating apoptosis to (i) facilitate shedding and hence dissemination, (ii) to prevent infected cells from presenting viral antigens to the immune system or (iii) to kill non-infected bystander and immune cells which would limit viral propagation. Hence the decision whether an infected host cell undergoes apoptosis or not depends on virus type and pathogenicity, its capacity to oppose antiviral responses of the infected cells and/or to evade any attack from immune cells. Viral genomes have therefore been adapted throughout evolution to satisfy the need of a particular virus to induce or inhibit apoptosis during its life cycle. Here we review the different strategies used by viruses to interfere with the two major apoptosis as well as with the innate immune signaling pathways in mammalian cells. We will focus on the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and discuss new ideas about how particular viruses could activately engage mitochondria to induce apoptosis of their host.","publish_time":"2015-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neumann, Simon; El Maadidi, Souhayla; Faletti, Laura; Haun, Florian; Labib, Shirin; Schejtman, Andrea; Maurer, Ulrich; Borner, Christoph","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/450a221c1528cca41fb907e93230576803afb369.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736565/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.02.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215001161; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215001161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cells","immune cells","mammalian cells","eukaryotic cells","apoptosis induction","major apoptosis","infected host cell","particular viruses","Subverting host cell apoptosis","viral replication","apoptosis inhibitory genes","advantage of stimulating apoptosis","viral infections","viral antigens","viral propagation","Viral genomes","non-infected bystander","crucial strategy of viruses","virus assembly","virus type","innate immune","immune system","production of essential viral proteins","virus reproduction phase","programmed cell death","new ideas","new hosts","different strategies","exhibit defence strategies","sense","capacity","spreading","primordial response of multicellular organisms","antiviral responses","intrinsic mitochondrial pathway","pathogenicity","time","pathways","need","doubt","fate","elimination","decision","evolution","Abstract","hand","shedding","life cycle","attack","sacrifice","dissemination","question"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Child travelers are numerous, exposed to the risk of diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, for which practitioners often lack experience. The assessment of febrile returning child travelers is becoming more frequent and challenging. The question of previous travel should be foremost in the checklist of the interview of any febrile child traveler, because this implies a possible tropical disease such as malaria that may be life-threatening. These need to be investigated and treated effectively and rapidly. There are highly contagious infections that could pose public health risks requiring implementation of hygienic and public health measures. A detailed immunization, medical, and travel history for exposure to infectious risks using geographic, seasonal, environmental, sociocultural, and epidemiological data are needed. Along with clinical examination and elementary first-line investigations, the history should guide second-line exams, which will provide the etiology and optimal treatment in approximately 75 % of cases. The majority of children will have a cosmopolitan infection that resolves spontaneously or is simple to treat. Malaria will need urgent and specific treatment. This article describes guidance on first-line evaluation and management of febrile child travelers as recommended in France.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sorge, F.; Velayudhan-Deschamps, N.; Faye, A.; Blond\u00E9, R.; Naudin, J.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7823cfc64949e723256c9f860fd028055a42730.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127267.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X16300161; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X16300161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["the interview","The question","The assessment","The majority","exposed to the risk","retour de voyage","which will provide the etiology","ant\u00E9c\u00E9dent de voyage","enfant f\u00E9brile","Abstract Child travelers","previous travel should be foremost in the checklist","the history should guide second-line exams","febrile child travelers as recommended in France","infections contagieuses","infections cosmopolites","any febrile child traveler","These need to be investigated","first-line evaluation","travel history","febrile returning child travelers is becoming more frequent","is simple to treat","children will","optimal treatment in approximately","Malaria will need urgent","traitement optimal","fi\u00E8vre des enfants","d\u00E9marche diagnostique","cas de paludisme","exposure to infectious risks using geographic","elementary first-line investigations","highly contagious infections that could pose public health risks requiring implementation","possible tropical disease such as malaria that may be","public health measures","both infectious","specific treatment","This article describes guidance","donn\u00E9es cliniques","donn\u00E9es g\u00E9ographiques","caract\u00E9ristiques de la fi\u00E8vre","nombreux risques","traitement antipaludique","enfants voyageurs","cosmopolitan infection that resolves spontaneously","because this implies","which practitioners often lack experience","hygienic","management","noninfectious","seasonal","diseases","numerous","examens compl\u00E9mentaires","treated effectively","environmental","charge recommand\u00E9e","Along with clinical examination","risque \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","hygi\u00E8ne","mise","sociocultural","paracliniques \u00E9l\u00E9mentaires","compte","diagnostic \u00E9tiologique","medical","challenging","prise","There","place de mesures","monde","millions","vaccinations r\u00E9alis\u00E9es","pathologies intertropicales","rapidly","threatening","exposition","detailed immunization","majorit\u00E9 des causes","sant\u00E9 publique","epidemiological","cases","praticiens","needed","d\u00E9lai","interrogatoire","urgence","notion","consultation","exp\u00E9rience"],"language":"fr"},

Continuous evolution and emergence of new variants of this virus are the major challenges for controlling the disease with routine vaccination. Successful vaccination usually requires the use of a homologous vaccine, which in turn necessitates continuous investigation of the circulating strains. Herein, we performed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction- (RT-PCR-) based investigation in broiler chicken flocks of the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. IBV was detected in 36.5% of the tested flocks (42 out of 115) from January 2012 to March 2014. Direct sequencing of hypervariable region-3 (HVR-3) of the Spike (S)-1 gene was performed, followed by phylogenetic analysis to determine the circulating IBV genotypes. Four lineages appear to coexist in this region, including the GI-13 or 4/91 IBV (31%), GI-16 or CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV (28.6%), GI-1 or Mass IBV (19%), and GI-23 or Middle East IBV (21.4%). The latter lineage include two subgroups: IS/720/99 IBV (16.7%) and IS/Variant2/98 IBV (4.7%). Some of the detections made in the 4/91 and Mass lineages are expected to belong to the vaccine strains. Lineages without a homologous vaccine in use (CK/CH/LDL/97I and Middle East) represent 50% of the isolates recovered in this study. Based on identity with the vaccine sequences, field observations, and frequent detection, these two lineages appear to be out of coverage of the IBV vaccines used in Saudi Arabia.

Methods All the outpatient clinical activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized. Expert staff members examined the electronic records, selecting whether the clinic appointments should be canceled or confirmed (via telephone consultation or face-to-face visit). The rate, indication, and modality of visits were investigated. Results Overall, 415 of 928 (45%) scheduled patients canceled their clinic appointment themselves or were canceled by staff members without rescheduling. The remaining 523 (55%) cases were screened undergoing telephone consultation in 295 (56%) and face-to-face visit in 228 (44%). The rate of face-to-face visit decreased from 63% to 9% during week 1 and 4, respectively. Seventy-four percent of face-to-face visits regarded suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection). The median age of patients in the face-to-face and telephone groups was 59 (range 20-69) and 65 years old (range 37-88), respectively. Conclusion A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility of the healthcare delivery. Forty-five percent visits were canceled without rescheduling. Although a minimum portion of face-to-face visit (\u003C10% 1 month after the lockdown) was preserved mostly for suspected malignancy or potentially life-threatening conditions, telemedicine proved a pragmatic approach allowing efficient screening of cases and adequate protection for patients and clinicians.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luciani, Lorenzo Giuseppe; Mattevi, Daniele; Cai, Tommaso; Giusti, Guido; Proietti, Silvia; Malossini, Gianni","journal":"Urology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8ee8beaa8de8c245efd89c0511003b783b7ed96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153527.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429520303836; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090429520303836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rate of face-to-face visit","percent of face-to-face visits","minimum portion of face-to-face visit","percent visits","suspected malignancy","Department of Urology","telephone groups","modality of visits","undergoing telephone consultation","pandemic","range","rescheduling","dangerous clinical conditions","Expert staff members","median age of patients","life-threatening conditions","outcomes of telemedicine","Northern Italy","clinic appointments","national lockdown","severe urinary symptoms","complicated urinary stones","new onset malignancy","efficient screening of cases","outpatient clinical activities","pragmatic approach","adequate protection","electronic records","reorganization","flexibility","dynamic scenario","weeks","outbreak","implementation","infection","Trento Province","healthcare delivery","Conclusion","Methods","clinicians","Covid","indication","Abstract Objective","years old","month","Results"],"language":"en"},

However, these diagnostic tests are generally unsatisfactory because they are not particularly sensitive and specific and are unable to deliver speedy results. Nucleic acid-based diagnostics, detecting pathogens through the identification of their genomic sequences, have shown promise to overcome the above limitations and become more widely adopted in clinical tests.

The analysis includes data from medical records of all patients admitted to ICUs who received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. For each patient, potential risk factors were collected. The main outcome of this study was the mortality during the stay in ICU after receiving mechanical ventilation RESULTS: A total of 262 adults and 175 pediatric patients were admitted to ICUs and received mechanical ventilation during the study period. For adult patients, the overall mortality was 37%, with a median survival time of 11 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-20 days). The main risk factors independently associated with the increased mortality rate were being aged 51-60 (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-1.0) and factors related to ICU admission. For the pediatric population, the mortality rate was 17%, with a median survival time of 16 days (IQR 7-37 days). Prematurity with respiratory problems was the main recorded cause of initiation of mechanical ventilation (50% of patients). Neonates who had mechanical ventilation within one month of their birth and were born extremely preterm had a high mortality rate after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Both patient age and the causes of the initiation of mechanical ventilation were influencing the survival of patients who required mechanical ventilation.","publish_time":"2019-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ismaeil, Taha; Almutairi, Jawaher; Alshaikh, Rema; Althobaiti, Zahrah; Ismaiel, Yassin; Othman, Fatmah","journal":"Saudi Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa8a0b3cfa95daea83c1fc448904d6627593bb59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6718855.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15537/smj.2019.8.24447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["King Abdulaziz Medical City","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["initiation of mechanical ventilation","mechanical ventilation RESULTS","survival of patients","pediatric patients","adult patients","days","main risk factors","survival of adult","high mortality rate","increased mortality rate","overall mortality","potential risk factors","median survival time","associated risk factors METHODS","main recorded cause of initiation","ICU admission","IQR","ICUs","study period","pediatric population","main outcome","retrospective cohort study","King Abdulaziz Medical City","medical records","patient age","King Abdullah Children\u2019s Specialist Hospital","KACSH","KAMC","Riyadh","respiratory problems","total","causes","stay","interquartile range","intensive care unit","data","adults","Saudi Arabia","analysis","Prematurity","birth","month","confidence interval","CONCLUSION","Neonates","odds ratio","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we evaluated the feasibility of performing nanofiltration of platelet lysates and determined the impact on expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs. Methods: Platelet lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing of pathogen-reduced (Intercept\u00AE) PCs suspended in 65% storage solution (SPP\u002B) and 35% plasma, and by serum-conversion of PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Lysates were added to the MSC growth media at 10% (v/v), filtered, and subjected to cascade nanofiltration on 35 and 19-nm Planova filters. Media supplemented with 10% starting platelet lysates or FBS were used as the controls. Impacts of nanofiltration on the growth media composition, removal of platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs), and MSC expansion were evaluated. Results: Nanofiltration did not detrimentally affect contents of total protein and growth factors, or the biochemical composition. The clearance factor of PEVs was over 3 log values. Expansion, of proliferation, membrane markers, differentiation potential, and immunosuppressive properties of cells in nanofiltered media were consistently better than those expanded in FBS-supplemented media. Compared to FBS, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes were expressed more in nanofiltered media, and there were fewer senescent cells over six passages. Conclusions: Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with two types of platelet lysates, including one prepared from pathogen-reduced PCs, is technically feasible. These data support the possibility of developing pathogen-reduced xeno-free growth media for clinical-grade propagation of human cells.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barro, Lassina; Nebie, Ouada; Chen, Ming-Sheng; Wu, Yu-Wen; Koh, Mickey BC; Knutson, Folke; Watanabe, Naoto; Takahara, Masayasu; Burnouf, Thierry","journal":"Cytotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33b0a54c7d77168d17540f1d1842d04303c0d57b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.04.099; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1465324920306563?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1465324920306563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPP","MSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Nanofiltration of growth media","nanofiltration of platelet lysates","growth media composition","MSC growth media","nanofiltered media","FBS-supplemented media","types of platelet lysates","platelet concentrates","pathogen-reduced PCs","Human platelet lysate","possibility of developing pathogen-reduced xeno-free growth media","growth factors","MSC expansion","Impacts of nanofiltration","cascade nanofiltration","removal of platelet extracellular vesicles","expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells","immunosuppressive properties of cells","fewer senescent cells","risks of pathogen transmission","plasma","clinical-grade propagation of human cells","expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs","xeno-free ex","biochemical composition","serum-conversion","fetal bovine serum","clearance factor of PEVs","differentiation potential","membrane markers","proliferation","osteogenesis genes","contents of total protein","Abstract Background","SPP","storage solution","chondrogenesis","passages","data","freeze","feasibility","Conclusions","log values","nm Planova filters","Intercept","Methods","controls","Results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, CFD (computer fluid dynamic) technology was used to simulate the wind environment around the buildings. The research focuses on the size, distribution and quantity of the concavity, which usually is defined as sky gardens. It is found that when the area of the opening is the same, the more number of opening, the more strengthened and distributed vertical wind velocity behind the building can be. The wind shadow area at the pedestrian height is further reduced. For holes distribution, the optimum ratio of the spacing between concavities to the void size for wind environment of tall buildings ranges from 1 to 3, which can disperse the surrounding heat in more efficiency and weaken the wind velocity in the lowest level.

Anticoccidial resistance has been reported in poultry and swine, and we recently described reduced toltrazuril efficacy in ovine Eimeria spp. in some Norwegian sheep farms using a newly developed faecal oocyst count reduction test (FOCRT). The aim of the present study was to use a controlled efficacy trial to assess the efficacy of toltrazuril against a field isolate suspected of being resistant. METHODS: Twenty lambs, 17\u201322 days old and raised protected against exposure to coccidia, were infected with a field isolate of 100,000 Eimeria spp. oocysts. This isolate was obtained from a farm with a previously calculated drug efficacy of 56% (95% confidence interval: -433.9 to 96.6%). At day 7 post-infection, 10 of the lambs were orally treated with 20 mg/kg toltrazuril (Baycox Sheep vet., Bayer Animal Health), while the other 10 lambs (controls) were given physiological saline. Clinical examinations were conducted, and weight gains recorded. Daily faecal samples were scored for diarrhoea on a scale from 1 to 5, and oocyst excretion was determined using a modified McMaster technique. Oocysts were morphologically identified to species level. At 17\u201324 days post-infection, the lambs were euthanized and necropsied. RESULTS: The tested Eimeria isolate was resistant against toltrazuril, and resistance was seen in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. In addition, no significant differences in faecal score, growth, gross pathology or histological changes were identified between the two groups. The pathogenic E. ovinoidalis was the dominant species, and no significant difference in the individual prevalence of E. ovinoidalis post-treatment was found between treated (66.9%) and control lambs (61.9%). Other species identified included E. crandallis/weybridgensis, E. parva, E. marsica, E. faurei, E. pallida, E. ahsata and E. bakuensis. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms toltrazuril resistance in ovine Eimeria spp.; in addition, the data support the use of FOCRT as an appropriate tool for field evaluation of anticoccidial efficacy. Due to limited anticoccidial treatment alternatives, these findings may have important implications for the sheep industry, particularly in northern Europe.

The objectives of this study were to compare the antiviral activity between monomeric catechin and dimeric procyanidin B2 (PB2) using cultivable human norovirus surrogates (feline calicivirus (FCV-F9) and murine norovirus (MNV-1)) and to understand their potential antiviral mechanism using virus-like particles (VLPs) and the P domain of human norovirus GII (HNoV GII.4). Surrogate viruses at 5 log PFU/mL were treated with 0.5\u20135 mg/mL monomeric catechin monohydrate, PB2 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2; control) at 37 \u00B0C over 24 h. Infectivity was determined using plaque assays and data from triplicate experiments were statistically analyzed. PB2 at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 3 h and MNV-1 by 0.21 and 1.23 log PFU after 24 h, respectively. Monomeric catechins at 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 6 h and MNV-1 titers to undetectable levels after 24 h. In addition, PB2 was shown to directly bind the P domain, the main capsid structure of HNoVs in the ratio of 1:1 through spontaneous interactions. Electrostatic interactions played a dominant role between PB2 and the P domain. PB2 significantly altered tertiary but not secondary structures of VLPs. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that PB2 aggregated VLPs, further indicating interactions between them. These findings indicate that PB2 causes structural changes of the P domain of VLPs, mainly through direct interaction leading to HNoV inactivation.","publish_time":"2018-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Dan; Deng, Jianjun; Joshi, Snehal; Liu, Pengbo; Zhang, Chao; Yu, Yan; Zhang, Ruijuan; Fan, Daidi; Yang, Haixia; D\u0027Souza, Doris H.","journal":"Food Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6e5e079559449f35afacca6c12f9d02cadd5d38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126691.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002018300637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30166160/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740002018300637; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2018.06.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["h.

Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats implemented in North Italy. METHODS: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of 635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic protocol. RESULTS: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3\u2019-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5\u2032). The genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76 bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV positive bats. CONCLUSIONS: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated.","publish_time":"2018-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lelli, Davide; Prosperi, Alice; Moreno, Ana; Chiapponi, Chiara; Gibellini, Anna Maria; De Benedictis, Paola; Leopardi, Stefania; Sozzi, Enrica; Lavazza, Antonio","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/763b9f4b50b77966e798d0271aebe87e6ea14a19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5816388.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-0949-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29454370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS","ORF","VAPV"],"locations":["Senegal"],"keyphrases":["VAPV positive bats","Virus identification","Virus isolation","novel rhabdovirus","Dantec virus","new virus","Vaprio virus","different viruses","genome organization","novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus","emerging viruses","PCRs","novel species","canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins","established genus Ledantevirus","complete genome size","negative staining electron microscopy","cell cultures","phylogenetic analysis","case of samples","different organs","diverse families of RNA viruses","phylogenetic analyses","G-U1","NGS sequencing","cell culture supernatants","hypothetical small protein","cytopathic effect","additional transcriptional unit","genes","viral ecology","LDV","framework","higher proportion of unknown","bp fragment","subgroup B","virological survey","wide range of vertebrates","zoonotic potential","human","disease associations","North Italy","specific RT-PCR","invertebrates","ORF","N-P","Pipistrellus kuhlii","period","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Senegal","diagnostic protocol","area","BACKGROUND","Rhabdoviridae","RESULTS","subset","mammals"],"language":"en"},

We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from commercial suppliers. Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures. Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform.

The purpose was to identify selected cellular changes and responses potentially associated with the clinical reactions of pigs infected with either or both of these viruses. Measurements included the (1) absolute and relative numbers of infected, viable, and apoptotic cells; (2) distribution of viral antigens; (3) levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03B1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1) produced and their association with the extent of virus-induced cytopathology. Four groups of AMs were studied, including mock-infected, PCV2 alone-infected (PCV2-A), PRRSV alone-infected (PRRSV-A), and PCV2 and PRRSV dually infected (PCV2/PRRSV) groups. The AMs of PCV2-A group had high antigen-containing rate without cell death. There was a marked increase in cell death and apoptosis in PRRSV-A group. However, a lower PRRSV-induced infectious rate, cell death, and apoptosis were seen in PCV2/PRRSV group. High levels of IFN-\u03B1 production were detected in PCV2-infected groups, but not in mock-infected and PRRSV-A groups. The PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells or swine AMs was markedly reduced by pre-incubation of the cells with UV-treated or non-UV-treated supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs. In addition, the reduction in CPE was abolished when the supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs were pre-treated with a mouse anti-recombinant porcine IFN-\u03B1 antibody. The results suggest that swine AMs were an important reservoir of PCV2; PCV2 infection reduced PRRSV infection and PRRSV-associated CPE in PCV2/PRRSV AMs; the reduction of PRRSV infection in AMs was mediated by IFN-\u03B1 generated by PCV2 infection. The reduced PRRSV-associated CPE in AMs and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production may lead to a more severe pneumonic lesion in those dually infected pigs.","publish_time":"2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Hui-Wen; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Liu, Jiuan J.; Lin, Tsang-Long; Chang, Chih-Cheng; Chia, Mi-Yuan; Tsai, Yi-Chieh; Pang, Victor F.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef410688aa7e605811d4c681be5211c19f4af137.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117408.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113505001161; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113505001161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","CPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV AMs","AMs of PCV2","infected AMs","PCV2-infected groups","PCV2 infection","PRRSV group","lower PRRSV","swine AMs","reduction of PRRSV infection","groups of AMs","mock-infected","infected pigs","reduced PRRSV-associated CPE","important reservoir of PCV2","relative numbers of infected","non-UV-treated supernatants of PCV2","\u03B1 production","TNF-\u03B1","cell death","High levels of IFN","mouse anti-recombinant porcine IFN-\u03B1 antibody","apoptosis","common viral pathogens of swine","apoptotic cells","induced cytopathology","porcine circovirus type","monolayer cultures of swine alveolar macrophages","infectious rate","high antigen","extent of virus","levels of interferon","respiratory syndrome virus","distribution of viral antigens","clinical reactions of pigs","tumor necrosis factor-alpha","increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production","MARC","responses","effects","pre-incubation","selected cellular changes","regard","severe pneumonic lesion","marked increase","cytopathic effect","purpose","association","addition","results","Measurements","viruses"],"language":"en"},

The first generation of synthetic vaccines has been largely based on DNA recombination technology and genetic manipulation. This de novo generation is occasionally time consuming and costly, especially in the era of genomics and when facing pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases. To accelerate and simplify the R\u0026D process for vaccines, we developed an improved method of synthetic vaccine construction based on protein assembly. We optimized and employed the recently developed SpyTag/SpyCatcher technique to establish a protein assembly system for vaccine generation from pre-prepared subunit proteins. As proof of principle, we chose a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting molecule and specific model antigens to generate desired vaccines. The results demonstrated that a new vaccine generated in this way does not hamper the individual function of different vaccine components and is efficient in inducing both T and B cell responses. This protein assembly strategy may be especially useful for high-throughput antigen screening or rapid vaccine generation.","publish_time":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhida; Zhou, Hang; Wang, Wenjun; Tan, Wenjie; Fu, Yang-Xin; Zhu, Mingzhao","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d492015c79953419dd1cfc47ebf6b50297e0334.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4248271.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434527/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07266","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine design","new vaccine","rapid vaccine generation","generation of synthetic vaccines","history of vaccine development","improved method of synthetic vaccine construction","traditional vaccines","desired vaccines","novo generation","individual function of different vaccine components","protein assembly system","protein assembly strategy","inactivated microorganisms","specific purposes","dendritic cell","developed SpyTag","specific model antigens","B cell responses","inducing","high-throughput antigen screening","opportunity","pre-prepared subunit proteins","SpyCatcher technique","molecule","stark contrast","DNA recombination technology","genetic manipulation","time consuming","DC","way","milestone","pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases","era of genomics","D process","proof of principle","results"],"language":"en"},

Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited and the prevalence of infection is high. Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk for severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC. Observation We present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus opinion of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic, though guiding data is scarce. The overarching goals of these approaches are to reduce the number of visits to a healthcare facility, reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies, and provide effective oncologic therapy. Patients with resectable disease can be treated with definitive non-operative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high. Non-operative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available. The order of treatments may be based on patient factors and clinical resources. Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate. For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results. Conclusions and Relevance The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is significantly elevated for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting alternative treatment strategies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisciplinary cancer team.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Sameera; Chmura, Steven; Robinson, Clifford; Lin, Steven H.; Gadgeel, Shirish M.; Donington, Jessica; Feliciano, Josephine; Stinchcombe, Thomas E.; Werner-Wasik, Maria; Edelman, Martin J.; Moghanaki, Drew","journal":"J Thorac Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3637bcc998e94886908088d2612912522a6eb70d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360578/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1556086420303312; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1556086420303312?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of LA","LA-NSCLC","Patients","COVID","radiation oncology","surgical oncology","radiation therapy","alternative treatment strategies","pandemic","risk of severe treatment-related morbidity","medical oncology","surgical resources","multidisciplinary cancer team","expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary","advanced non-small cell lung cancer","severe morbidity","immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies","Non-operative options","risk of SARS","mortality","clinical resources","definitive non-operative management","effective oncologic therapy","concurrent chemotherapy","consensus opinion of alternative strategies","hypofractionated schedules","sequential schedules","order of treatments","risks of perioperative care","chemoimmunotherapy","symptoms","comorbidities","healthcare facility","exposure","patient factors","communication","Relevance","negative viral test results","number of visits","guiding data","resectable disease","approaches","Observation","Conclusions","Importance","locations","long-term outcomes","prevalence of infection","overarching goals","lives"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Objective. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees\u2019 access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10 000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods. This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called \u201CUHSAs\u201D (which stands for \u201Cunit\u00E9s hospitali\u00E8res sp\u00E9cialement am\u00E9nag\u00E9es\u201D, and can be translated as \u201Cspecially equipped hospital units\u201D). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results. The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection\u2019s spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of \u201CCovid units\u201D, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives\u2019 wellbeing) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside, could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known \u201Crevolving prison doors\u201D effect. Discussion. The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fovet, Thomas;

Mouse models allow direct assessment of host genetic factors responsible for susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Based on an assessment of early stage lines from the Collaborative Cross mouse multi-parent population, we identified two lines showing highly divergent susceptibilities to SARS-CoV: the resistant CC003/Unc and the susceptible CC053/Unc. We generated 264 F2 mice between these strains, and infected them with SARS-CoV. Weight loss, pulmonary hemorrhage, and viral load were all highly correlated disease phenotypes. We identified a quantitative trait locus of major effect on chromosome 18 (27.1\u201358.6 Mb) which affected weight loss, viral titer and hemorrhage. Additionally, each of these three phenotypes had distinct quantitative trait loci [Chr 9 (weight loss), Chrs 7 and 12 (virus titer), and Chr 15 (hemorrhage)]. We identified Ticam2, an adaptor protein in the TLR signaling pathways, as a candidate driving differential disease at the Chr 18 locus. Ticam2(\u2212/\u2212) mice were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, exhibiting increased weight loss and more pulmonary hemorrhage than control mice. These results indicate a critical role for Ticam2 in SARS-CoV disease, and highlight the importance of host genetic variation in disease responses.","publish_time":"2017-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gralinski, Lisa E.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Morgan, Andrew P.; Totura, Allison L.; Beall, Anne; Kocher, Jacob; Plante, Jessica; Harrison-Shostak, D.

The patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country. Special attention must be paid to CAP in Southeast Asia (SEA), a region facing rapid demographic transition. Estimates burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential for the clinical and public health management. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence, aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the Vietnamese adult population. METHODS: A prospective surveillance for hospitalised adult CAP was conducted in Khanh Hoa Province, Central Vietnam. All adults aged \u226515 years with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR. RESULTS: Of all 367 LRTI episodes examined, 174 (47%) were CAP. Older age, the presence of underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients was 9.8%. Among 286 sputum samples tested for bacterial PCR, 79 (28%) were positive for H. influenzae, and 65 (23%) were positive for S. pneumoniae. Among 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses; influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common. CONCLUSIONS: The current adult CAP incidence in Vietnam was relatively low; this result was mainly attributed to the young age of our study population.","publish_time":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takahashi, Kensuke; Suzuki, Motoi; Minh, Le Nhat; Anh, Nguyen Hien; Huong, Luu Thi Minh; Son, Tran Vo Vinh; Long, Phan The; Ai, Nguyen Thi Thuy; Tho, Le Huu; Morimoto, Konosuke; Kilgore, Paul E; Anh, Dang Duc; Ariyoshi, Koya; Yoshida, Lay Myint","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e7e3df5deec55ed5c2fa7f9cba8854c6aeb7ab6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3702433.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23815298/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-296","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["Khanh Hoa Province","PCR","CAP"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Vietnam","Central Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["aetiological patterns of CAP","current adult CAP incidence","year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP","respiratory viruses","study population","bacterial PCR","case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients","Vietnamese adult population","patterns of aetiological pathogens","lower respiratory tract infections","LRTI episodes","sputum samples","Bacterial pathogens","viral PCR","presence of underlying respiratory conditions","region","non-pneumonic LRTI","young age","Older age","clinical pictures","Central Vietnam","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus influenzae","person years","risk factors of community","common infectious disease","conventional culture","polymerase chain reaction","NPLRTI","Khanh Hoa Province","Moraxella catarrhalis","higher index score of smoking","prospective surveillance","BACKGROUND","nasopharyngeal specimens","CONCLUSIONS","public health management","significant morbidity","Southeast Asia","rapid demographic transition","METHODS","country","Estimates","mortality","radiological findings","elderly","provincial hospital","RESULTS","adults","Special attention","purposes"],"language":"en"},

These viruses are transmitted to humans through contact with their respective South American rodent hosts. Each uses human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as its obligate receptor. Accidental similarities between human TfR1 and TfR1 orthologs of arenviral host species enable zoonoses, whereas mice and rats are not infectable because they lack these TfR1 determinants of infection. All pathogenic New World arenaviruses bind to a common region of the apical domain of TfR1. The ability of a New World arenavirus to use human TfR1 is absolutely predictive of its ability to cause hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Non-pathogenic arenaviruses, closely related to hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, cannot utilize human TfR1 but efficiently enter cells through TfR1 orthologs of their native rodent hosts. Mutagenesis studies suggest that minor changes in the entry glycoproteins of these non-pathogenic viruses may allow human transmission. TfR1 is upregulated as a result of iron sequestration during the acute phase response to infection, and the severity of disease may result from amplification of viral replication during this response.","publish_time":"2011-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choe, Hyeryun; Jemielity, Stephanie; Abraham, Jonathan; Radoshitzky, Sheli R.; Farzan, Michael","journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a7d7a25d797132cd676fa07da4c262333d340e3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fb0256ad22b70da544191a250968ae767fac7519.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3159852.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369527411000981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21807555/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527411000981; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3159852?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human TfR1","TfR1 determinants of infection","apical domain of TfR1","human transmission","severe human hemorrhagic fevers","Non-pathogenic arenaviruses","human transferrin receptor","TfR1 orthologs of arenviral host species","pathogenic New World arenaviruses","hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses","ability","humans","non-pathogenic viruses","native rodent hosts","obligate receptor","respective South American rodent hosts","acute phase response","result of iron sequestration","zoonoses","contact","common region","minor changes","mice","entry glycoproteins","cells","Accidental similarities","amplification of viral replication","severity of disease","Mutagenesis studies","rats"],"language":"en"},

Improvements in detection technologies in instrumentation and chemistries to label these probes have made it possible to use up to six spectrally distinguishable probes per reaction well. With the remarkable advances made in the characterization of human genome diversity, it has been possible to describe empirical patterns of SNPs and haplotype variation in the genome of diverse human populations. These patterns have revealed that the human genome is structured in blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). Because SNPs tend to be in LD with each other, common haplotypes share common SNPs and thus the majority of the diversity in a region can be characterized by typing a very small number of SNPs; so-called tag SNPs. Herein lies the advantage of the multiplexing ability of molecular beacons, since it becomes possible to use as few as 30 probes to interrogate several haplotypes in a high-throughput approach. Thus, through the combined use of tag SNPs and molecular beacons it becomes possible to type individuals for clinically relevant haplotypes in a high-throughput manner at a cost that is orders of magnitude less than that for high throughput sequencing methods.","publish_time":"2009-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barreiro, Luis B.; Henriques, Ricardo; Mhlanga, Musa M.","journal":"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5bfbfc6d701e7a8cf93b0b89a1af2d703d6bd57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19768600/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-60327-411-1_17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common SNPs","so-called tag SNPs","empirical patterns of SNPs","combined use of tag SNPs","small number of SNPs","common haplotypes","high-throughput manner","high-throughput approach","characterization of human genome diversity","relevant haplotypes","genome of diverse human populations","multiplexing ability of molecular beacons","high throughput sequencing methods","LD","distinguishable probes","haplotype variation","instrumentation","cost","blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium","single nucleotide polymorphisms","detection technologies","chemistries","majority","individuals","orders of magnitude","Improvements","advantage","remarkable advances","tool","region","reaction","decade"],"language":"en"},

The results of this study show that post-surgical administration of an extended-release buprenorphine product is safe in Fischer 344 rats and does not necessarily cause substantial adverse effects, confirming that opiate therapy is a viable choice in laboratory animal medicine.","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cowan, Alan; Sarabia-Estrada, Rachel; Wilkerson, Gina; McKnight, Patrick; Guarnieri, Michael","journal":"Lab Anim (NY)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3b4cd3d7aa46f8795e95ed4734b69ae69870504.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092016.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684956/; https://doi.org/10.1038/laban.745","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fischer"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control rats","body weight","extended-release buprenorphine product","safety of extended","times","weight loss","clinical signs","Clinical pathology results","opiate therapy","Fischer","study","target animal safety trial","post-surgical administration","laboratory animal medicine","substantial adverse effects","post-surgical subcutaneous injections","laboratory animals","substantial abnormalities","Signs of nausea","related behavior","adverse events","microscopic histopathology examinations","symptoms","dermal lesions","viable choice","effective analgesic","drug injection sites","authors","intended dose","minor consequence","mice"],"language":"en"},

Nearly 30,000 JE cases with 10,000 deaths are still annually reported in East Asia. Although the JEV genotype III vaccine has been licensed, it elicits a lower protection against other genotypes. Moreover, no effective treatment for a JE case is developed. This study constructed a pBR322-based and cytomegaloviruses (CMV) promoter-driven JEV replicon for the production of JEV single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) in a packaging cell line expressing viral structural proteins. Genetic instability of JEV genome cDNA in the pBR322 plasmid was associated with the prokaryotic promoter at 5\u2032 end of the JEV genome that triggers the expression of the structural proteins in E. coli. JEV structural proteins were toxic E. coli, thus the encoding region for structural proteins was replaced by a reporter gene (enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP) that was in-frame fused with the first eight amino acids of the C protein at N-terminus and the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide at C-terminus in a pBR322-based JEV-EGFP replicon. JEV-EGFP SRIPs generated from JEV-EGFP replicon-transfected packaging cells displayed the infectivity with cytopathic effect induction, self-replication of viral genomes, and the expression of EGFP and viral proteins. Moreover, the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of antiviral agents according to fluorescent intensity and positivity of SRIP-infected packaging cells post treatment. MJ-47, a quinazolinone derivative, significantly inhibited JEV-induced cytopathic effect, reducing the replication and expression of JEV-EGFP replicon in vitro. The IC50 value of 6.28 \u00B5M for MJ-47 against JEV was determined by the assay of JEV-EGFP SRIP infection in packaging cells plus flow cytometry that was more sensitive, effective, and efficient compared to the traditional plaque assay. Therefore, the system of JEV-EGFP SRIPs plus flow cytometry was a rapid and reliable platform for screening antiviral agents and evaluating antiviral potency.","publish_time":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Chien-Yi; Hour, Mann-Jen; Wang, Ching-Ying; Huang, Su-Hua; Mu, Wen-Xiang; Chang, Yu-Chun; Lin, Cheng-Wen","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6308a19784dd34b796ecd3a981e32c01e866ee03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5408682.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9040076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28394283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III","E. coli"],"organizations":["JEV","EGFP"],"locations":["East Asia"],"keyphrases":["expression of JEV","JEV-EGFP SRIPs","assay of JEV","inhibited JEV","system of JEV","combination of JEV","JEV genotype","JEV structural proteins","pBR322-based JEV-EGFP replicon","production of JEV single","JEV-EGFP replicon-transfected packaging cells","expression of EGFP","promoter-driven JEV replicon","Genetic instability of JEV genome cDNA","EGFP SRIP infection","viral proteins","viral structural proteins","flow cytometry","infected packaging cells","positivity of SRIP","packaging cell line","screening antiviral agents","values of antiviral agents","antiviral potency","pBR322 plasmid","C protein","C-terminus","coli","effective treatment","MJ","self-replication of viral genomes","cytopathic effect induction","green fluorescent protein","positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome","fluorescent intensity","N-terminus","IC50 value","prokaryotic promoter","JE cases","mouth disease virus","Japanese Encephalitis virus","traditional plaque assay","big open reading frame","infectivity","reliable platform","CMV","reporter gene","half maximal inhibitory concentration","FMDV","foot","infectious particles","encoding region","ORF","flavivirus","amino acids","cytomegaloviruses","peptide","quinazolinone derivative","mosquito","\u00B5M","end","deaths","untranslated regions","UTRs","lower protection","genotypes","vaccine","East Asia","study"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12\u201318 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students\u2019 awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.

In some cases, infection may be just one biological event that occurs during a multievent process that develops sequentially, over time, and involves genetic and environmental factors that may vary among individuals. Consequently, the role of infectious organisms in the development of human disease may not meet all of the criteria normally required to determine when an organism can be called the cause of a disease. This chapter reviews the expanding role of infections in the development of human disease. We discuss prion diseases of humans, a fascinating example of an infectious disease-causing agent that is not a living organism. We also discuss the diseases of unknown etiology for which infectious organisms may play a role.

In this transition, a reduction in mortality is followed by a reduction in fertility, creating larger, older populations in which the main causes of illness and death are no longer acute infections of children but chronic diseases of adults. Since the year 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have provided a framework for accelerating the decline of infectious diseases, backed by a massive injection of foreign investment to low-income countries. Despite the successes of the MDGs era, the inhabitants of low-income countries still suffer an enormous burden of disease owing to diarrhoea, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other pathogens. Adding to the predictable burden of endemic disease, the threat of pandemics is ever-present and global. With a view to the future, this review spotlights five aspects of the fight against infection beyond 2015, when the MDGs will be replaced by a new set of goals for poverty reduction and sustainable development. These aspects are: exploiting the biological links between infectious and non-infectious diseases; controlling infections among the new urban majority; enhancing the response to international health threats; expanding childhood immunization programmes to prevent acute and chronic diseases in adults; and working towards universal health coverage. By scanning the wider horizon now, infectious disease specialists have the chance to shape the post-2015 era of health and development.","publish_time":"2014-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dye, Christopher","journal":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c40606c62e96d3ea8313b67bf60e8148eeb45f05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4024220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24821913/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2013.0426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["era of health","chronic diseases of adults","decline of infectious diseases","non-infectious diseases","MDGs era","infectious disease specialists","enormous burden of disease","international health threats","poverty reduction","Millennium Development Goals","central narrative of global health","sustainable development","aspects","universal health coverage","predictable burden of endemic disease","acute infections of children","inhabitants of low-income countries","new set of goals","epidemiological transition","new urban majority","childhood immunization programmes","diarrhoea","response","threat of pandemics","massive injection of foreign investment","tuberculosis","older populations","HIV","AIDS","pneumonia","death","chance","biological links","main causes of illness","review spotlights","malaria","future","decades","centuries","fight","fertility","wider horizon","year","framework","mortality","timescales","pathogens","successes"],"language":"en"},

Conventional treatments against the disease are designed to target viral proteins. However, the emergence of viral variants carrying drug-resistant mutations can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals. Diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application. METHODS: In this study, we report that nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin and bafilomycin improves the drugs\u2019 anti-influenza applicability. RESULTS: Using PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, sub-200 nm diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 42% and 100%, respectively. The drug-loaded nanoparticles have sustained drug release kinetics beyond 72 hours and facilitate intracellular drug delivery to two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines. As compared to free drugs, the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater in vitro antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin by approximately 3 and 5-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge, treatment with diphyllin nanoparticles resulted in reduced body weight loss and viral titer in the lungs. In addition, following a lethal influenza viral challenge, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment conferred a survival advantage of 33%. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the potential of the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for host-targeted treatment against influenza.","publish_time":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Che-Ming Jack; Chen, You-Ting; Fang, Zih-Syun; Chang, Wei-Shan; Chen, Hui-Wen","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cfcdcf2a3783b9adba2b091bd50c5d8ac3252ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6298390.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s185806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587980/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Diphyllin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diphyllin nanoparticles","diphyllin nanoparticle treatment","nm diphyllin","bafilomycin nanoparticles","nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin","lethal influenza viral challenge","Influenza virus infections","nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors","drug-loaded nanoparticles","therapeutic index of diphyllin","viral titer","viral proteins","drugs\u2019 anti-influenza applicability","mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge","potent vacuolar ATPase","different influenza virus-permissive cell lines","intracellular drug delivery","drug release kinetics","drug-resistant mutations","potential","emergence of viral variants","RESULTS","host-targeted treatment","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","target effect","encapsulation efficiency","lower cytotoxicity","reduced body weight loss","PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers","hours","major public health concern","poor water solubility","disease","survival advantage","development of pathogen","free drugs","clinical application","lungs","study","BACKGROUND","addition","Conventional treatments","antivirals","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","fold"],"language":"en"},

It is the causative agent of nasopharyngeal aspirate disease and death in children. The HboV genomic structure is a linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Its clinical pathogenic characteristics have been extensively studied, however, at present the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HBoV infection is not completely clear. In this study, a total of 293 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between ARTI cases and healthy plasma samples were characterized using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled bioinformatics analysis, among which 148 were up-regulated and 135 were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) annotated an enrichment of DEPs in complement activation and biological processes like immunity, inflammation, signal transduction, substance synthesis, and metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis enriched DEPs mainly in the Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310), PPAR signaling pathway (ko03320), intestinal immune network for IgA production (ko04672), complement and coagulation cascades (ko04610), Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04620) and B cell receptor signaling pathway (ko04662). Further, expression levels of three candidate proteins (upregulated PPP2R1A and CUL1, and downregulated CETP) were validated using western blotting. Our investigation is the first analysis of the proteomic profile of HBoV-infected ARTI cases using the iTRAQ approach, providing a foundation for a better molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of ARTI in children.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bian, Junmei; Liang, Min; Ding, Shuxian; Wang, Liyan; Ni, Wenchang; Xiong, Shisi; Li, Wan; Bao, Xingxing; Gao, Xue; Wang, Rong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6277684930fa5819fe101a39441601ab89da85a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6872134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31751365/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225261","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene Ontology"],"organizations":["ARTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathway","pathogenesis of ARTI","pathogenesis of HBoV infection","infected ARTI cases","analysis enriched DEPs","candidate proteins","enrichment of DEPs","proteomic profile of HBoV","HboV genomic structure","bioinformatics analysis","nasopharyngeal aspirates of Swedish children","iTRAQ approach","Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins","genus Bocavirus","complement activation","molecular mechanism","Human bocavirus","B cell receptor","better molecular understanding","acute respiratory tract infection","causative agent of nasopharyngeal aspirate disease","inflammation","immunity","Genomes","isobaric tags","biological processes","intestinal immune network","ko04672","signal transduction","upregulated PPP2R1A","CUL1","KEGG","healthy plasma samples","linear single-stranded DNA","family Parvoviridae","absolute quantitation","downregulated CETP","substance synthesis","IgA production","ko03320","foundation","death","Toll","COG","member","ko04620","Wnt","coagulation cascades","ssDNA","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","ko04610","subfamily Parvovirus","ko04662","PPAR","ko04310","expression levels","metabolism","western blotting","clinical pathogenic characteristics","Gene Ontology","total","study","investigation"],"language":"en"},

Although the catalytic activity of the ACE2, APN, and DPP4 peptidases is not required for virus entry, co-expression of other host proteases allows efficient viral entry. In addition, evolutionary conservation of these receptors may permit interspecies transmissions. Because of the physiological function of these peptidase systems, pathogenic host responses may be potentially amplified and cause acute respiratory distress.","publish_time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bosch, Berend Jan; Smits, Saskia L.; Haagmans, Bart L.","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82f6415a21a610c61adb2b5c91f9bd254e203270.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9efd6dfa0affdc5b4ec6be60fd2ca85e028ff2ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4072739.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625714000716; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2014.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762977/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625714000716","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["entry receptors","human respiratory tract","ACE2","virus entry","APN","acute respiratory distress","efficient viral entry","human-infecting coronaviruses","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","peptidase systems","host proteases","dipeptidyl peptidase","DPP4 peptidases","pathogenic host responses","co-expression","severe disease","enzyme","step","angiotensin","cells","physiological function","evolutionary conservation","membrane ectopeptidases","aminopeptidase N","addition","catalytic activity","interspecies transmissions","infection","interaction"],"language":"en"},

This article addresses this question from three particular perspectives: that of the materialities of health, that of nature and that of networks. The first perspective analytically blends biological dynamics, environmental influence and social practice. The second perspective, mainly influenced by multispecies ethnographies, foregrounds the liveliness and unboundedness of cities. Finally, the third perspective analyses how health is drawn into the domain of security. The article argues that while globalization and urbanization are often discussed as having triggered the emergence and spread of pathogens, urban epidemics are not self\u2010evident and \u2018natural\u0027 consequences of these pro\u2010cesses. They do not fall neatly into universal categories of space, modernity or risk; rather, they are produced and shaped by a range of social, political, biological and economic sites and scales. Accordingly, the emergence of pathogens depends on its articulation through specific analytical frameworks.

In this study, we investigated the seasonality of the total newly notified pulmonary TB cases by subgroups such as time period, sex, age, occupation, district, and sputum smear result from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan by a popular seasonal adjustment model (TRAMO-SEATS). METHODS: Monthly pulmonary TB cases from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan were analyzed by the TRAMO-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Seasonal amplitude was calculated and compared within the subgroups. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2013, there were 77.76 thousand newly notified pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan, China. There was a dominant peak spring peak (March) with seasonal amplitude of 56.81% and a second summer peak (September) of 43.40%, compared with the trough month (December). The spring seasonal amplitude in 2004\u20132008 was higher than that of 2009\u20132013(P\u003C0.05). There were no statistical differences for spring seasonal amplitude within subgroups of gender, age, district, and sputum smear result (P\u003E0.05). However, there were significant differences in spring seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 59.37% to 113.22% (P\u003C0.05). The summer seasonal amplitude in 2004\u20132008 was higher than that of 2009\u20132013(P\u003C0.05). There were no statistical differences in summer seasonal amplitude within subgroups of gender, district, sputum smear result(P\u003E0.05). There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by age, with amplitude ranging from 36.05% to 100.09% (P\u003C0.05). Also, there were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 43.40% to 109.88% (P\u003C0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was an apparent seasonal variation in pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan. We speculated that spring peak in our study was most likely caused by the increased reactivation of the latent TB due to vitamin D deficiency and high PM2.5 concentration, while the summer peak was mainly resulted from the enhanced winter transmission due to indoor crowding in winter, overcrowding of public transportation over the period of the Spring Festival and health care seeking delay in winter.","publish_time":"2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xiaobing; Duan, Qionghong; Wang, Jianjie; Zhang, Zhengbin; Jiang, Gaofeng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51e10bb6f0ef0363cab568d94c52db244ce7ad1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4193739.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25303675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spring seasonal amplitude","summer seasonal amplitude","summer peak","apparent seasonal variation","notified pulmonary TB cases","Monthly pulmonary TB cases","popular seasonal adjustment model","dominant peak spring peak","TRAMO-SEATS seasonal adjustment program","significant differences","latent TB","statistical differences","Spring Festival","sputum smear result","district","subgroups of gender","age","occupation","Wuhan city","prevalence data of pulmonary tuberculosis","subgroup of smear positive","seasonality","study","enhanced winter transmission","time period","vitamin D deficiency","sex","indoor crowding","health care","high PM2","delay","concentration","total","public transportation","report","METHODS","China","increased reactivation","CONCLUSIONS","spectral analysis","trough month","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Quick and accurate detection and differentiation of different pathogens are necessary for epidemiological surveillance, disease management and import and export controls. In this study, we developed and validated a panel of multiplex real-time PCR/RT-PCR assays composed of four subpanels, each detects three common swine pathogens. The panel detects 12 viruses or viral serotypes, namely, VSV-IN, VSV-NJ, SVDV, CSFV, ASFV, FMDV, PCV2, PPV, PRV, PRRSV-NA, PRRSV-EU and SIV. Correlation coefficients (R2) and PCR amplification efficiencies of all singular and triplex real-time PCR reactions are within the acceptable range. Comparison between singular and triplex real-time PCR assays of each subpanel indicates that there is no significant interference on assay sensitivities caused by multiplexing. Specificity tests on 226 target clinical samples or 4 viral strains and 91 non-target clinical samples revealed that the real-time PCR panel is 100% specific, and there is no cross amplification observed. The limit of detection of each triplex real-time PCR is less than 10 copies per reaction for DNA, and less than 16 copies per reaction for RNA viruses. The newly developed multiplex real-time PCR panel also detected different combinations of co-infections as confirmed by other means of detections.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Xiju; Liu, Xuming; Wang, Qin; Das, Amaresh; Ma, Guiping; Xu, Lu; Sun, Qing; Peddireddi, Lalitha; Jia, Wei; Liu, Yanhua; Anderson, Gary; Bai, Jianfa; Shi, Jishu","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/633ee9755d994f4e6f4515a40b507dd81cb17811.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119729.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27506582/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416300040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416300040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR/RT-PCR","SIV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["panel of multiplex real-time PCR","triplex real-time PCR assays","triplex real-time PCR reactions","developed multiplex real-time PCR panel","RT-PCR assays","PCR amplification efficiencies","differentiation of different pathogens","common swine pathogens","copies","non-target clinical samples","swine production systems","viral strains","different combinations of co-infections","PRRSV-NA","PRRSV-EU","viral serotypes","accurate detection","VSV-NJ","limit of detection","cross amplification","RNA viruses","intensive production conditions","disease management","ASFV","FMDV","CSFV","PCV2","PPV","PRV","epidemiological surveillance","SVDV","R2","Abstract Mixed infection","assay sensitivities","significant interference","Specificity tests","subpanels","Comparison","Correlation coefficients","acceptable range","multiplexing","export controls","DNA","means of detections","study"],"language":"en"},

In this paper the role of alternative food as a disease controller in a disease induced predator\u2013prey system is studied. Stability criteria and the persistence conditions for the system are derived. Bifurcation analysis is done with respect to rate of infection. The main goal of this study is to show the non-trivial consequences of providing alternative food in a disease induced predator\u2013prey system. Numerical simulation results illustrate that there exists a critical infection rate above which disease free system cannot be reached in absence of alternative food whereas supply of suitable alternative food makes the system disease free up to certain infection level.

RESULTS: In this study, we applied bioinformatic biodata mining methods to detect CDS and protein sequences of ORF1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from oronasopharynx of an Iranian patient. Then through the computational modelling and antigenicity prediction approaches, the identified polyprotein sequence was analyzed. The results revealed that the identified ORF1ab polyprotein belongs to a part of nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) with the high antigenicity residues in a glycine-proline or hydrophobic amino acid rich domain.

Bats are commonly associated with vampire lore and thus elicit largely fearful reactions despite the fact that they are a vital and valuable part of the ecosystem. Bats provide a variety of essential services from pest control to plant pollination. Despite the benefits of bats to the environment and the economy, bats are suffering at the hands of humans. They are victims of turbines, human encroachment, pesticides, and, most recently, white nose syndrome. Because of their critical importance to the environment, humans should do what they can to help protect bats. We propose that humans will be more likely to do so if their perceptions and attitudes toward bats can be significantly improved. In a preliminary study we found some support for the idea that people can be educated about bats through bat oriented events and exhibits, and that this greater knowledge can inspire humans to act to save bats.","publish_time":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmaster, Eric; Vonk, Jennifer; Mies, Rob","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bc8716c8d60412f241f096246127275b734635b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4730123.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani6010006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26784239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["benefits of bats","Public perception of bats","hands of humans","environment","exhibits","variety of essential services","pest control","support","human encroachment","bat oriented events","victims of turbines","fearful reactions","vampire lore","fact","pesticides","pollination","greater knowledge","perceptions","people","critical importance","economy","white nose syndrome","ecosystem","preliminary study","idea","carriers of disease","attitudes"],"language":"en"},

A large proportion of the Hong Kong elderly population has not undergone influenza vaccination. An exploration of the correlates will provide significant information to help identify ways of improving vaccination uptake among Chinese elderly people. Objectives To explore the prevalence and correlates of influenza vaccination Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or above. To investigate any differences in attitudes toward influenza vaccination among Hong Kong elderly people with different levels of cognitive and physical functioning. Design An exploratory cross-sectional survey with two objective assessments was employed. Settings: Fifteen elderly centers in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Participants: A total of 816 Hong Kong Chinese elderly participants were recruited. Methods Face-to-face interviews were adopted to explore the demographic characteristics, perceptions, health status, knowledge, and resources of, and the influence of disease outbreaks on, influenza vaccination. Two objective validated instruments, the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) and the Barthel Index-Modified Chinese Version (MCBI) were used to assess the cognitive status and physical functioning of the participants. Results Approximately two in three individuals (62.4%) had undergone influenza vaccination. Lower cognitive and physical functioning scores were found among the non-vaccinated participants. Multivariate logistic regression analyzes revealed the significant correlates associated with influenza vaccination to be consideration of vaccination in the subsequent years (aOR=7.877; p \u003C0.001); consideration of vaccination if all people aged 65 or above were eligible to receive free vaccination (aOR=3.024; p =0.002); the belief that there is a need to receive influenza vaccination following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza (aOR=2.413; p =0.001); receiving advice from nursing staff of elderly centers (aOR=7.161; p \u003C0.001); the medical staff of elderly centers (aOR=3.771; p \u003C0.001) or family members or friends (aOR=3.023; p =0.001). Conclusions The prevalence of elderly Chinese people undergoing influenza vaccination remains suboptimal. The government can promote vaccination by educating the public about the advantages, by publicizing locations where vaccinations are available, and having nursing, other medical staff, family and friends encourage elderly people to be vaccinated. A high vaccination coverage rate must be ensured to achieve international goals.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Lam; Lau, Ying; Lau, Ying Hon","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea23ec453cc608e947baa6fe733bfbb400801f00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094414.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2008.12.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748908003519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19162264/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748908003519","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["consideration of vaccination","vaccination uptake","free vaccination","correlates of influenza vaccination Hong Kong Chinese elderly people","Hong Kong elderly people","avian influenza","Hong Kong Chinese elderly participants","prevalence of elderly Chinese people","aOR","Hong Kong elderly population","influenza virus infection","nursing staff of elderly centers","medical staff of elderly centers","high vaccination coverage rate","Chinese Version","Abstract Background Worldwide pandemics of influenza virus","Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","significant correlates","cognitive status","physical functioning scores","non-vaccinated participants","Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination","friends","different levels of cognitive","health status","family members","significant information","severe complications","objective assessments","objective validated instruments","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","SARS","mortality","extensive morbidity","CMMSE","effective method","vaccinations","perceptions","Barthel Index","ways","advice","attitudes","publicizing locations","total","demographic characteristics","large proportion","subsequent years","advantages","exploratory cross-sectional survey","resources","knowledge","influence of disease outbreaks","Conclusions","Multivariate logistic regression","MCBI","need","differences","Settings","Methods Face-to-face interviews","belief","exploration","Objectives","international goals","Results","individuals","government"],"language":"en"},

The etiology and clinical impact of HCoVs in Chinese adults with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) needs to be characterized systematically by molecular detection with excellent sensitivity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we detected 4 non-SARS related HCoV species by real-time RT-PCR in 981 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from March 2009 to February 2011. All specimens were also tested for the presence of other common respiratory viruses and newly identified viruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). 157 of the 981 (16.0%) nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for HCoVs. The species detected were 229E (96 cases, 9.8%), OC43 (42 cases, 4.3%), HKU1 (16 cases, 1.6%) and NL63 (11 cases, 1.1%). HCoV-229E was circulated in 21 of the 24 months of surveillance. The detection rates for both OC43 and NL63 were showed significantly year-to-year variation between 2009/10 and 2010/11, respectively (P\u003C0.001 and P = 0.003), and there was a higher detection frequency of HKU1 in patients aged over 60 years (P = 0.03). 48 of 157(30.57%) HCoV positive patients were co-infected. Undifferentiated human rhinoviruses and influenza (Flu) A were the most common viruses detected (more than 35%) in HCoV co-infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) and HBoV were detected in very low rate (less than 1%) among adult patients with URTI. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: All 4 non-SARS-associated HCoVs were more frequently detected by real-time RT-PCR assay in adults with URTI in Beijing and HCoV-229E led to the most prevalent infection. Our study also suggested that all non-SARS-associated HCoVs contribute significantly to URTI in adult patients in China.","publish_time":"2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Roujian; Yu, Xiaoyan; Wang, Wen; Duan, Xijie; Zhang, Linglin; Zhou, Weimin; Xu, Jin; Xu, Lingjie; Hu, Qin; Lu, Jianxin; Ruan, Li; Wang, Zhong; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d1a2055895ffdcdf57aabcaf436f176b1650c50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3376151.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22719912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","URTI"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["non-SARS-associated HCoVs","URTI","cases","HCoV positive patients","non-SARS related HCoV species","human coronaviruses","common respiratory viruses","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","common viruses","adult patients","human parainfluenza virus","common respiratory pathogens","HCoV co-infections","clinical impact of HCoVs","Undifferentiated human rhinoviruses","Respiratory syncytial virus","identified viruses","HBoV","molecular detection","detection rates","nasopharyngeal swabs","OC43","NL63","study","acute upper respiratory tract infection","real-time RT-PCR assay","higher detection frequency of HKU1","Chinese adults","prevalent infection","year variation","hMPV","RSV","Beijing","PIV","presence","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","excellent sensitivity","etiology","addition","SIGNIFICANCE","years","China","METHODOLOGY","low rate","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","months of surveillance","specimens"],"language":"en"},

The viral genome contains one open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein that can be processed by viral proteinases. The crucial 3C proteinases (3C(pro)s) of picornaviruses share similar spatial structures and it is becoming apparent that 3C(pro) plays a significant role in the viral life cycle and virus host interaction. Importantly, the proteinase and RNA-binding activity of 3C(pro) are involved in viral polyprotein processing and the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. In addition, 3C(pro) can induce the cleavage of certain cellular factors required for transcription, translation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to modulate cell physiology for viral replication. Due to interactions between 3C(pro) and these essential factors, 3C(pro) is also involved in viral pathogenesis to support efficient infection. Furthermore, based on the structural conservation, the development of irreversible inhibitors and discovery of non-covalent inhibitors for 3C(pro) are ongoing and a better understanding of the roles played by 3C(pro) may provide insights into the development of potential antiviral treatments. In this review, the current knowledge regarding the structural features, multiple functions in the viral life cycle, pathogen host interaction, and development of antiviral compounds for 3C(pro) is summarized.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Di; Chen, Shun; Cheng, Anchun; Wang, Mingshu","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70948646d2777b7a433c7558b5c3488bdb77e526.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4810272.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999188/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v8030082","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C proteinases","viral proteinases","viral genome","viral pathogenesis","viral replication","viral life cycle","viral polyprotein processing","initiation of viral RNA synthesis","development of irreversible inhibitors","development of antiviral compounds","development of potential antiviral treatments","pathogen host interaction","virus host interaction","discovery of non-covalent inhibitors","structural features","single polyprotein","essential factors","structural conservation","RNA-binding activity","cleavage of certain cellular factors","large group of non-enveloped viruses","major impact","multiple functions","transcription","translation","open reading frame","nucleocytoplasmic trafficking","cell physiology","significant role","picornaviruses","insights","current knowledge","similar spatial structures","veterinary health","roles","Picornaviridae family","better understanding","efficient infection","review","addition","interactions"],"language":"en"},

National biosecurity standards have been developed for Canadian mink farms, but it is unclear how well these standards have been implemented as there are no studies correlating management practices of mink producers with causes of death in mink kits. To that end, we surveyed Ontario mink producers on their biosecurity and management practices and conducted almost 5660 post mortem examinations on found-dead, preweaned kits to characterize mink farm biosecurity practices and causes of death in preweaned kits. RESULTS: We found that very few biosecurity and management practices were uniformly used by producers, despite good awareness of appropriate practices. Use of personal protective equipment was implemented by fewer than 50% of respondents, while control of mink shed access, disinfection of feed containers after use, and use of a rodent control program were the only practices implemented by greater than 70% of respondents. Only 18% of producers reported regular use of antimicrobials in feed or water, although 91% stated they used antimicrobials for treatment of bacterial diseases on a regular basis. On post mortem examination, no gross abnormalities were noted in 71% of the kits, 45% were thought to be stillborn or aborted, 27% had some form of abnormal fluid distribution in the body, and 2% had a congenital malformation. A subset of 69 gastrointestinal tract samples was submitted for bacterial culture, of which 45 samples yielded sufficient growth. Most interesting was the identification of Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg in 11% of samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will provide a benchmark for Canadian mink producers and their veterinarians, defining the areas to which greater attention should be given to ensure more rigorous biosecurity practices are in place. Ultimately, these improvements in practices may contribute to increased mink production and animal well-being.

These identifiers, which are not informative for most people, are often substituted by biologically meaningful names in various presentations to facilitate utilization and dissemination of sequence-based knowledge. This substitution is commonly done manually that may be a tedious exercise prone to mistakes and omissions. RESULTS: Here we introduce SNAD (Sequence Name Annotation-based Designer) that mediates automatic conversion of sequence UIDs (associated with multiple alignment or phylogenetic tree, or supplied as plain text list) into biologically meaningful names and acronyms. This conversion is directed by precompiled or user-defined templates that exploit wealth of annotation available in cognate entries of external databases. Using examples, we demonstrate how this tool can be used to generate names for practical purposes, particularly in virology. CONCLUSION: A tool for controllable annotation-based conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically meaningful names and acronyms has been developed and placed into service, fostering links between quality of sequence annotation, and efficiency of communication and knowledge dissemination among researchers.","publish_time":"2009-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sidorov, Igor A; Reshetov, Denis A; Gorbalenya, Alexander E","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47266ea82145a11ad6e82db70a4d0fbd86a27cb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2739203.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19682364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dissemination of sequence","meaningful names","quality of sequence annotation","controllable annotation-based conversion of sequence UIDs","automatic conversion of sequence UIDs","Annotation-based Designer","based knowledge","wealth of annotation available","knowledge dissemination","tool","acronyms","unique identifiers","growing diversity of biological data","efficient computer-mediated data storage","efficiency of communication","utilization","cognate entries of external databases","maintenance","proteins","polynucleotides","multiple alignment","various presentations","plain text list","phylogenetic tree","user-defined templates","mistakes","omissions","tedious exercise prone","links","SNAD","BACKGROUND","processing","practical purposes","researchers","CONCLUSION","virology","service","people","RESULTS","examples","substitution"],"language":"en"},

These infections are usually managed presumptively due to lack of appropriate diagnostic tools. This situation, can lead to poor management of febrile illness or antibiotic misuse. In addition, there are limited data on the spectrum of pathogens commonly responsible for these ARI. This study was conducted to explore the pathogens community among patients with acute respiratory infection in a rural area in Senegal. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from August to December 2015. Children and adult patients attending Keur Soc\u00E9 health post for signs suggestive of acute respiratory infection were enrolled after providing inform consent. Eligible participants were recruited using a consecutive sampling method. Paired nose and throat swabs were collected for pathogen detection. Samples were processed using a multiplex PCR designed to identify 21 pathogens including both virus and bacteria. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty patients participated in the study. Samples positivity rate was evaluated at 95.2% (238/250). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen (74%) and was present in all months and all age-groups, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (28,8%) and rhinovirus (28,4%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected only among children under 5 years old in August and September while coronavirus was present in all age groups, during the months of October and December. CONCLUSION: This pilot study revealed a diversity of pathogens over the time and across all age groups, highlighting the need for further exploration. A pathogen community approach including both virus and bacteria at a larger scale becomes crucial for a better understanding of transmission dynamics at population level in order to help shape ARI control strategies.","publish_time":"2018-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tine, Roger C.; Ndiaye, L\u00E9on A.; Niang, Mbayame N.; Kiori, Davy E.; Dia, Ndongo; Gaye, Oumar; Broutin, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13a2da5074d1480d1e302628606afd1f17ac782e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6131886.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200897/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3362-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Acute Respiratory Infections"],"locations":["Senegal"],"keyphrases":["Acute Respiratory Infections","pathogens community","age-groups","age groups","Respiratory syncytial virus","spectrum of pathogens","diversity of pathogens","pilot study","signs suggestive of acute respiratory infection","adult patients","bacteria","pathogen community approach","Children","predominant pathogen","pathogen detection","Senegal","cross sectional study","months","shape ARI control strategies","Samples positivity rate","common causes of febrile illnesses","poor management of febrile illness","Keur Soc\u00E9 health post","order","population level","better understanding of transmission dynamics","larger scale","throat swabs","rural area","antibiotic misuse","limited data","settings","coronavirus","RSV","time","BACKGROUND","consecutive sampling method","lack of appropriate diagnostic tools","Paired nose","Streptococcus pneumoniae","METHODS","Staphylococcus aureus","multiplex PCR","need","Eligible participants","years old","addition","situation","CONCLUSION","rhinovirus","exploration","consent","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The study investigated the inhibitory effect and its antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro on TLR7-mediated cytokine production. TLR7 agonist (imiquimod (IMQ)) concentration-dependently induced activation of ISRE-, NF-\u03BAB- and AP-1-luciferase reporters, as well as the production of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, IL-6 and IL-8 in human promonocyte cells. However, SARS-CoV PLPro significantly inhibited IMQ-induced cytokine production through suppressing the activation of transcription factors IRF-3, NF-\u03BAB and AP-1. Western blot analysis with anti-Lys48 and anti-Lys63 ubiquitin antibodies indicated the SARS-CoV PLPro removed Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6, but not Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains in un-treated and treated cells. The decrease in the activated state of TRAF3 and TRAF6 correlated with the inactivation of TBK1 in response to IMQ by PLPro. The results revealed that the antagonism of SARS-CoV PLPro on TLR7-mediated innate immunity was associated with the negative regulation of TRAF3/6-TBK1-IRF3/NF-\u03BAB/AP1 signals.","publish_time":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shih-Wen; Wang, Ching-Ying; Jou, Yu-Jen; Huang, Su-Hua; Hsiao, Li-Hsin; Wan, Lei; Lin, Ying-Ju; Kung, Szu-Hao; Lin, Cheng-Wen","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d117c8256785f2ff80a40fba878aa4f022d8310b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4881504.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164085/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17050678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV PLPro","antagonism of SARS","production of IFN","NF-\u03BAB","TLR7-mediated cytokine production","production of type","Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of TRAF3","inhibited IMQ-induced cytokine production","antagonistic mechanism of SARS","Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains","anti-Lys48","anti-Lys63 ubiquitin antibodies","TRAF6","IL","treated cells","TLR7 agonist","induced activation of ISRE","negative regulation of TRAF3","activated state of TRAF3","IFN-\u03B2","TNF-\u03B1","inactivation of TBK1","TBK1-IRF3","human promonocyte cells","activation of transcription factors IRF","IFNs","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pro-inflammatory cytokines","TLR3","receptor","Toll","interferons","Western blot analysis","concentration","innate immunity","retinoic acid-inducible gene","papain","inhibitory effect","RIG","imiquimod","response","AP1 signals","decrease","protease","luciferase reporters","study","results","pathways"],"language":"en"},

In this study, Paralichthys olivaceus cathepsin B (PoCatB) cDNA was isolated from flounder embryonic cells (FEC) treated with UV-inactivated grass carp hemorrhage virus (GCHV) and subsequently identified as a virally induced gene. The full length cDNA of PoCatB is 1801bp encoding 330-amino acids. The deduced protein has high homology to all known cathepsin B proteins, containing an N-terminal signal peptide, cysteine protease active sites, the occluding loop segment and a glycosylation site, all of which are conserved in the cathepsin B family. PoCatB transcription of FEC cells could be induced by turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) rhabdovirus (SMRV), UV-inactivated SMRV, UV-inactivated GCHV, poly I:C or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and SMRV or poly I:C was revealed to be most effective among the five inducers. In normal flounder, PoCatB mRNA was detectable in all examined tissues. Moreover, SMRV infection could result in significant upregulation of PoCatB mRNA, predominantly in spleen, head kidney, posterior kidney, intestine, gill and muscle with 18.2, 10.9, 24.7, 12, 31.5 and 18 fold increases at 72h post-infection respectively. These results provided the first evidence for the transcriptional induction of cathepsin B in fish by virus and LPS, indicating existence of a novel function in viral defense.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Fu-Tie; Zhang, Yi-Bing; Chen, Yu-Dong; Zhu, Rong; Dong, Cai-Wen; Li, Yang-Yang; Zhang, Qi-Ya; Gui, Jian-Fang","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b32e3e2b7c3598deea425036dc4d39bc5910e799.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111675.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464808001721; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2008.07.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18755278/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464808001721","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsin"],"organizations":["FEC","SMRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cathepsin B family","Abstract Cathepsin B","UV-inactivated SMRV","known cathepsin B proteins","Paralichthys olivaceus cathepsin B","transcriptional induction of cathepsin B","SMRV infection","UV-inactivated GCHV","length cDNA of PoCatB","PoCatB transcription of FEC cells","significant upregulation of PoCatB mRNA","LPS","UV-inactivated grass carp hemorrhage virus","lysosomal cysteine protease","flounder embryonic cells","cysteine protease active sites","posterior kidney","head kidney","enzyme family","normal flounder","induced gene","h post-infection","occluding loop segment","N-terminal signal peptide","high homology","intestine","papain","spleen","fish","existence","turbot","bp","rhabdovirus","novel function","multiple biological functions","glycosylation site","fold increases","gill","Scophthalmus maximus","evidence","study","lipopolysaccharide","viral defense","deduced protein","examined tissues","muscle","amino acids","inducers","results"],"language":"en"},

Study design Throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from hospitalized pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections. Specimens negative for other respiratory viruses by molecular screening were examined for HBoV. Results HBoV was the only virus detected in 30 (5.6%) of 531 samples. Of these positive cases, 56.7% were from children less than 2 years old. Two groups of HBoV co-circulated in Taiwan during the study. Results of evolutionary networks evaluation suggest that HBoV might have had an opportunity for interbreeding of viruses and genetic recombinations among the different genes.

The developments in sequencing technology and bioinformatics have outpaced the capacity to analyze and interpret the sequence data. The influence of sample processing, nucleic acid extraction and purification, harmonized protocols for generation and interpretation of data, and properly annotated and curated reference databases including non-pathogenic \u201Cnatural\u201D strains are other major obstacles to the realization of the full potential of HTS in analytical food surveillance, epidemiological and outbreak investigations, and in complementing preventive approaches for the control and management of foodborne pathogens. Despite significant obstacles, the achieved progress in capacity and broadening of the application range over the last decade is impressive and unprecedented, as illustrated with the chosen examples from the literature. Large consortia, often with broad international participation, are making coordinated efforts to cope with many of the mentioned obstacles.

We sought to determine the clinical evidence for the risk of transmission of ARIs to HCWs caring for patients undergoing AGPs compared with the risk of transmission to HCWs caring for patients not undergoing AGPs. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, University of York CRD databases, EuroScan, LILACS, Indian Medlars, Index Medicus for SE Asia, international health technology agencies and the Internet in all languages for articles from 01/01/1990 to 22/10/2010.

The outcome of interest was risk of ARI transmission. The quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE system. We identified 5 case-control and 5 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of SARS to HCWs. Procedures reported to present an increased risk of transmission included [n; pooled OR(95%CI)] tracheal intubation [n = 4 cohort; 6.6 (2.3, 18.9), and n = 4 case-control; 6.6 (4.1, 10.6)], non-invasive ventilation [n = 2 cohort; OR 3.1(1.4, 6.8)], tracheotomy [n = 1 case-control; 4.2 (1.5, 11.5)] and manual ventilation before intubation [n = 1 cohort; OR 2.8 (1.3, 6.4)]. Other intubation associated procedures, endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebulizer treatment, administration of O2, high flow O2, manipulation of O2 mask or BiPAP mask, defibrillation, chest compressions, insertion of nasogastric tube, and collection of sputum were not significant. Our findings suggest that some procedures potentially capable of generating aerosols have been associated with increased risk of SARS transmission to HCWs or were a risk factor for transmission, with the most consistent association across multiple studies identified with tracheal intubation.","publish_time":"2012-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tran, Khai; Cimon, Karen; Severn, Melissa; Pessoa-Silva, Carmem L.; Conly, John","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04d9df812fd77e1231263d42ab45e570cd94d956.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3338532.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22563403/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased risk of transmission","risk of ARI transmission","HCWs","transmission of SARS","increased risk of SARS transmission","risk factor","AGPs","procedures","ARIs","tracheal intubation","case-control","retrospective cohort studies","manipulation of O2 mask","administration of O2","relevant studies","multiple studies","patients","high flow O2","BiPAP mask","text articles","clinical evidence","manual ventilation","non-invasive ventilation","quality of evidence","health care workers","international health technology agencies","SE Asia","LILACS","Index Medicus","University of York CRD databases","EuroScan","Indian Medlars","chest compressions","defibrillation","pathogens","suction of body fluids","Cochrane Library","nebulizer treatment","CINAHL","insertion of nasogastric tube","bronchoscopy","Internet","endotracheal aspiration","pre-defined criteria","MEDLINE","abstracts","acute respiratory infections","collection of sputum","Independent reviewers","consistent association","aerosols","EMBASE","PubMed","languages","abstracted data","GRADE system","findings","outcome","tracheotomy","Disagreements","consensus"],"language":"en"},

Intriguing opportunity exists in combining the two modes of antiviral activity in the same polymer structure such that the same polymer acts as a microbicide and also serves to deliver the conjugated drug (ribavirin) into the cells. We explore this opportunity in detail and focus on the polymer backbone as a decisive constituent of such formulations. Fourteen polyanions (polycarboxylates, polyphosphates and polyphosphonates, and polysulfonates) were analyzed for blood pro/anti coagulation effects, albumin binding and albumin aggregation, inhibitory activity on polymerases, cytotoxicity, and anti-inflammatory activity in stimulated macrophages. Ribavirin containing monomers were designed to accommodate the synthesis of macromolecular prodrugs with disulfide-exchange triggered drug release. Kinetics of drug release was fast in all cases however enhanced hydrophobicity of the polymer significantly slowed release of ribavirin. Results of this study present a comprehensive view on polyanions as backbone for macromolecular prodrugs of ribavirin as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuwala, Kaja; Riber, Camilla F.; L\u00F8vschall, Kaja Borup; Andersen, Anna H.F.; S\u00F8rensen, Lise; Gajda, Paulina; Tolstrup, Martin; Zelikin, Alexander N.","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73bef56a5413095ad768aa4118258686618ae229.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114659.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29432822/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365918300725; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365918300725","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["release of ribavirin","macromolecular prodrugs of ribavirin","polymer backbone","broad-spectrum antiviral agents","modes of antiviral activity","polymer structure","polymer acts","Kinetics of drug release","inhibitory activity","synthesis of macromolecular prodrugs","anti-inflammatory activity","intracellular delivery of antiviral drugs","polyanions","conjugated drug","disulfide-exchange triggered drug release","albumin binding","albumin aggregation","blood pro","Intriguing opportunity","anti coagulation effects","polymerases","carriers","cytotoxicity","microbicides","comprehensive view","cases","promise","polyphosphates","polyphosphonates","study","polysulfonates","decisive constituent","stimulated macrophages","enhanced hydrophobicity","polycarboxylates","formulations","Results","monomers"],"language":"en"},

Endothelial dysfunction is an early step in vascular inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetic vascular complications, sepsis-induced or severe virus infection-induced organ injuries. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines and vascular adhesion molecules induced by various stimuli, such as modified lipids, smoking, advanced glycation end products and bacteria toxin, significantly contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction. The transcriptional regulation of inflammatory cytokines and vascular adhesion molecules has been well-studied. However, the regulation of those gene expressions at post-transcriptional level is emerging. RNA-binding proteins have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression acting predominantly at the post-transcriptional level in microRNA-dependent or independent manners.

Newborn infections and related mortality can be reduced by maternal tetanus toxoid vaccination, clean delivery, cord hygiene, exclusive and early breast-feeding, and prompt diagnosis and therapy. Diarrheal deaths can be prevented by adequate attention to breast-feeding, hand-washing and sanitation strategies, rota virus vaccine, adequate treatment including oral rehydration, appropriate dietary therapy, and oral zinc administration.

The developments of specific, potent and accessible antiviral treatments that restrain rotavirus infection remain important to control rotavirus disease. METHODS: 150 plant extracts with nutritional applications were screened in vitro on MA-104 cells for their antiviral activity against rhesus rotavirus (RRV). One extract (Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R.Dahlgren) was also tested for its effect on the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) of Caco-2 cells caused by simian rotavirus (SA-11) infection. RESULTS: Aqueous extracts of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. fruit, Urtica dioica L. root, Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R.Dahlgren leaves, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. root and Olea europaea L. leaves were found to have strong significant antiviral activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) \u003C 300 \u03BCg/ml. The pure compound 18\u00DF-glycyrrhetinic acid from Glycyrrhiza glabra was found to have the strongest antiviral activity (IC50 46 \u03BCM), followed by luteolin and vitexin from Aspalathus linearis (IC50 respectively 116 \u03BCM and 129 \u03BCM) and apigenin-7-O-glucoside from Melissa officinalis (IC50 150 \u03BCM). A combination of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. \u002B Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. and Urtica dioica L. \u002B Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. showed synergy in their anti-viral activities.

NMD also operates in natural infection contexts, and while some viruses have evolved genome expression strategies to overcome this process altogether, the virulence of NMD-activating viruses entails their ability to directly suppress NMD or to promote an NMD-unfavorable cellular state.

Currently, \u003E200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic, with the number of infections and deaths still increasing. As an extreme event, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly damaged the global economic growth and caused a certain impact on the environment. This paper takes China as a case study, comprehensively evaluating the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the environment. The analysis results indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 improves China\u0027s air quality in the short term and significantly contributes to global carbon emission reduction. However, in the long run, there is no evidence that this improvement will continue. When China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes large-scale industrial production, its energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to exceed the level before the event. Moreover, COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere. The decline initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. The above phenomenon shows that the decreasing economic activities and traffic restrictions directly lead to the changes of China\u0027s energy consumption and further prevent the environment from pollution. The results in this study support the fact that strict quarantine measures can not only protect the public from COVID-19, but also exert a positive impact on the environment. These findings can provide a reference for other countries to assess the influence of COVID-19 on the environment.","publish_time":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qiang; Su, Min","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e84b07d4bd208aa18f867d8cb843796a65edfe9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348946/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138915; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324323; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["environment","outbreak of COVID","influence of COVID","dynamic impact of COVID","certain impact","positive impact","countries","global economic growth","energy use","changes of China\u0027s energy consumption","case study","analysis results","extreme event","decreasing economic activities","China\u0027s air quality","global carbon emission reduction","threatening world public health security","GHG","greenhouse gas","short term","large-scale industrial production","emissions","traffic restrictions","fact","NO2","strict quarantine measures","lockdown","concentration of nitrogen dioxide","evidence","number of infections","epidemic","level","phenomenon","paper","long run","deaths","atmosphere","reference","regions","coronavirus disease","decline","Wuhan","findings","improvement","pollution","country"],"language":"en"},

In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, p value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.. Conclusion: The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population. Patients should be informed to safely proceed with their treatment and follow the rules for self-protection to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quartuccio, Luca; Valent, Francesca; Pasut, Enrico; Tascini, Carlo; Vita, Salvatore De","journal":"Joint bone spine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0357d5d97be31c0f818aec9efaa21d1e2176b9b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbspin.2020.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1297319X20300889; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1297319X20300889?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445935/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Friuli Venezia Giulia"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of COVID","risk of COVID","rheumatic patients","adult patients","small molecules","biologic agents","general population","chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases","population-based study","PCR","months","Confidence Interval","cases","swab test positive","particular chronic inflammatory arthritides","province of Udine","swab tests","prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","chi square test","years old","Friuli Venezia Giulia region","SARS-CoV","p value","Italy","inhabitants","end","aim","rules","self-protection","primary outcome","Abstract Objective","treatment","symptoms compatible","Conclusion","Methods","outbreak","period","Results","total"],"language":"en"},

We previously reported that the innate immune system via the toll-like receptor (TLR) response induced by corticosteroids leads to the development of ONFH and that repression of IRF7 activity by an inhibitor could interfere with the development of ONFH while maintaining the therapeutic effect of the corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we hypothesize that lansoprazole has the potential to suppress IRF7 activity and prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in rats. Furthermore, we conducted a preliminary clinical trial to prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in autoimmune disease patients. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups. On Day 1, each rat was injected with TLR4 ligand (LPS) or TLR7 ligand (imiquimod), followed by methylprednisolone with or without lansoprazole on Day 2. They were killed at 1 or 14 days after the last injection.We prospectively recruited 30 patients requiring primary high-dose corticosteroid treatment for immune diseases. All patients were administered lansoprazole, starting the night before corticosteroid treatment began. MRI was performed before corticosteroid treatment, and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks afterward. RESULTS: In rats, co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids significantly repressed both IRF7 activity and the development of ONFH. Moreover, in the human patients, the incidence of ONFH was significantly decreased from 53.4 to 13.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present study is preliminary, the results show that co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids prevents ONFH development. Lansoprazole may be both safe and effective in preventing osteonecrosis of the femoral head in patients needing corticosteroid treatment.","publish_time":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kosukegawa, Ima; Okazaki, Shunichiro; Yamamoto, Motohisa; Nagoya, Satoshi; Suzuki, Chisako; Shimizu, Junya; Takahashi, Hiroki; Yamashita, Toshihiko","journal":"Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f0b6955ff7d88f3317601489072dfdd7f832e15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7181448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31938894/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00590-020-02622-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ONFH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of ONFH","ONFH development","corticosteroid-induced ONFH","co-treatment of lansoprazole","incidence of ONFH","corticosteroids","primary high-dose corticosteroid treatment","human patients","repression of IRF7 activity","autoimmune disease patients","osteonecrosis","femoral head","RESULTS","present study","Male Wistar rats","TLR7 ligand","TLR4 ligand","immune diseases","effective prevention strategy","preliminary clinical trial","innate immune system","toll","LPS","receptor","imiquimod","inhibitor","therapeutic effect","BACKGROUND","METHODS","response","methylprednisolone","potential","night","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS","injection","MRI","days","groups","weeks"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the host ceRNA network changes and biological relevance of circRNAs in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (Calu-3) cells infected with the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A total of \u226549337 putative circRNAs were predicted. Among the 7845 genes which generated putative circRNAs, 147 (1.9%) of them each generated \u226530 putative circRNAs and were involved in various biological, cellular, and metabolic processes, including viral infections. Differential expression (DE) analysis showed that the proportion of DE circRNAs significantly (P \u003C 0.001) increased at 24 h-post infection. These DE circRNAs were clustered into 4 groups according to their time-course expression patterns and demonstrated inter-cluster and intra-cluster variations in the predicted functions of their host genes. Our comprehensive circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network identified 7 key DE circRNAs involved in various biological processes upon MERS-CoV infection. Specific siRNA knockdown of two selected DE circRNAs (circFNDC3B and circCNOT1) significantly reduced MERS-CoV load and their target mRNA expression which modulates various biological pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ubiquitination pathways. These results provided novel insights into the ceRNA network perturbations, biological relevance of circRNAs, and potential host-targeting antiviral strategies for MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xi; Chu, Hin; Wen, Lei; Shuai, Huiping; Yang, Dong; Wang, Yixin; Hou, Yuxin; Zhu, Zheng; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yin, Feifei; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cd1be88f8787d09aaf55dcc91418401b9965c72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170352.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32223537/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1738277","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Circular RNAs","DE"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["putative circRNAs","biological relevance of circRNAs","MERS-CoV infection","various biological processes","various biological pathways","mRNA network","host ceRNA network changes","potential host","host genes","ceRNA network perturbations","reduced MERS-CoV load","host competitive endogenous RNA","target mRNA expression","cells","Differential expression","viral infections","potential antiviral targets","h-post infection","inter-cluster","metabolic processes","time-course expression patterns","antiviral strategies","circRNA expressions","ubiquitination pathways","predicted functions","noncoding RNAs","Circular RNAs","intra-cluster variations","comprehensive circRNA-miRNA","important RNA regulatory roles","closed loop structures","pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial","MAPK","integral component","circCNOT1","mitogen-activated protein kinase","unique splicing reactions","Calu","novel insights","circFNDC3B","Specific siRNA knockdown","Recent studies","analysis","results","proportion","groups","total"],"language":"en"},

Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. AIM: The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people\u2019s sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic and explore the context in which they manifest. METHODS: A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. OUTCOMES: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people\u2019s sexual behavior. RESULTS: While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. STRENGTH \u0026 LIMITATIONS: This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used. CONCLUSION: During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, overall sexual activity, frequency, and risky behaviors declined significantly among young men and women in China.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Weiran; Li, Guanjian; Xin, Cong; Wang, Yaochi; Yang, Sen","journal":"J Sex Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6451426340d210682f4fe5bb9c8536111ceecf5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188657.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.04.380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["sexual frequency","risky sexual behavior","sexual desire","people\u2019s sexual behavior","sexual activity","risky sexual experiences","preliminary exploration of sexual behavior","COVID","number of sexual partners","study outcomes","changes","present study","outbreak","RESULTS","pandemic","study-specific questionnaire","risky behaviors","preliminary understanding","preliminary evidence","women","participants","decrease","potential health implication","small convenience sample","coronavirus disease","young men","potential interventions","World Health Organization","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","age","rapid reduction","partner relationship","current findings","SARS-CoV","items","Multiple regression analysis","wide range of individual responses","need","individuals","CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS","online survey","China","additional question","height","data","population","METHODS","STRENGTH","LIMITATIONS","AIM","CONCLUSION","generalizability","context","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

However, based on published data and documents, the identification of CPV and its variant in clinically symptomatic individual dogs in Thailand through Asia is limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the emergence of CPV and to consequently establish the genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the CPV strains from 209 dogs showing respiratory distress in Thailand. RESULTS: This study identified and described the full-length CPV genome from three strains, designated herein as CPV_CP13 TH/2015, CPV_CP82 TH/2016 and CPV_SR1 TH/2016, that were isolated from six dogs out of 209 dogs (2.9%) with respiratory illness in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these three Thai CPV strains (CPV TH strains) belong to the CPV subgroup A and form a novel lineage; proposed as the Asian prototype. Specific mutations in the deduced amino acids of these CPV TH strains were found in the G/glycoprotein sequence, suggesting potential substitution sites for subtype classification. Results of intragenic recombination analysis revealed that CPV_CP82 TH/2016 is a recombinant strain, where the recombination event occurred in the L gene with the Italian prototype CPV Bari/100\u201312 as the putative major parent. Selective pressure analysis demonstrated that the majority of the nucleotides in the G/glycoprotein were under purifying selection with evidence of positive selection sites. CONCLUSIONS: This collective information on the CPV TH strains is the first evidence of CPV emergence with genetic characterization in Thailand and as first report in Asia, where homologous recombination acts as a potential force driving the genetic diversity and shaping the evolution of canine pneumovirus.

METHODS: Women\u2019s health and disease news articles were collated from a popular news website between 1993 to 2015 and preprocessed using gynecological medical terminology, Korean words and nouns (excluding general nouns not related to women\u2019s healthcare topics). The resultant articles (N = 7,710) were analyzed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and major topics were extracted. Topic trends were analyzed by year and period for women\u2019s health. RESULTS: It was observed that most of the women\u2019s health articles were focused on \u201CHealthcare\u201D, and 9 other topics were identified that represented a relatively small proportion in 1993\u20132000. In 2001\u20132005, most of the articles were focused on \u201CMedical Services\u201D and \u201CDietary Supplements\u201D with some specific topics that peaked people\u2019s interest, as compared to those focused on \u201CHealthcare\u201D in the 1990s. It was also observed that differences in the proportion of each topic was small after 2011. CONCLUSION: Changes in topics related to women\u2019s disease were not clearly distinguished in the 1990s but this changed from 2001where articles related to \u201Cwomen disease\u201D appeared as articles on the topics of various diseases.","publish_time":"2019-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Kyoung Won; Kim, Shine Young; Woo, Young Woon","journal":"Osong Public Health Res Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb7432cee2519eefd1a6672e1f0bc483c9527a8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6590882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2019.10.3.07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["women\u2019s health articles","women\u2019s healthcare topics","women\u2019s disease","field of women\u2019s health","disease news articles","major topics","specific topics","popularity of topics","resultant articles","topics of various diseases","analysis of online news articles","women disease","small proportion","popular news website","general nouns","Medical Services","Topic trends","gynecological medical terminology","Korean words","Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm","Dietary Supplements","year","period","Changes","METHODS","research","differences","people\u2019s","CONCLUSION","time","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The results of the in vitro experiment contribute significantly to the evaluation of direct cell response to the substitute biomaterial, and the in vivo tests constitute a step midway between in vitro tests and human clinical trials. Therefore, it is essential to develop or adopt a suitable in vivo bone defect animal model for testing bone substitutes for defect repair.

Without comprehensive protection, during a severe hospital outbreak in the Peking University People\u0027s Hospital (PKUPH), there were 78 patients diagnosed with SARS and two deaths. During treatment, most patients received large doses of steroid shock therapy, which may result in complications of femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to follow up the condition of lung and bone in those patients. Methods We did an observational cohort study of patients with SARS from 2003 to 2018. We carried out pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI tests, pulmonary function tests, and hip joint functional assessment to evaluate the recovery condition of lung damage and femoral head necrosis according to patients\u0027 willingness. We used linear regression, and mixed-model repeated-measures analysis to measure the change of lung interstitial and femoral head necrosis volume. This study was authorised by the Ethics Committee of Peking University People\u0027s Hospital (2018PHB010-01). All recruited SARS patients signed informed consent for the study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03443102. Findings There were 80 medical staff patients with SARS altogether in Peking University People\u0027s Hospital. Two patients died of SARS in 2003 and 78 patients were enrolled in this study from August, 2003, to March, 2018. 71 patients completed the 15 years\u0027 follow-up and seven patients were missing. Pulmonary injury scope on lung CT improved from 2003 (9\u00B740%, SD 7\u00B783) to 2004 (3\u00B720%, 4\u00B778; p\u22640\u00B7001), and thereafter remained steady to 2018 (4\u00B760%, 6\u00B737). Pulmonary function items in patients with SARS did not differ between 2006 and 2018. The recovery extent of pulmonary function items between 2006 and 2018 in patients with lung interstitial change (n=13), was less than that without lung interstitial changes (n=23), especially in one-second ratio (FEV1/FVC, t=2\u00B721, p=0\u00B704) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF25\u201375%, t=2\u00B776, p=0\u00B701). The volume of femoral head necrosis decreased significantly from 2003 (38\u00B783%, SD 21\u00B701) to 2005 (30\u00B738%, 20\u00B723; p=0\u00B70002), then decreased slowly from 2005 to 2013 (28\u00B799%, 20\u00B759) and thereafter remained steady to 2018 (25\u00B752%, 15\u00B751)%. Interpretation Damaged lung interstitial and functional decline induced by SARS mainly recovered in the next 1\u20132 years after rehabilitation. The natural process of femoral head necrosis caused by large doses of steroid shock therapy in SARS patients was not progressive, while partially reversible.

This review article summarizes recent developments in the functional investigation of viroporins from various viruses and their contributions to viral replication and virulence.","publish_time":"2015-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sze, Ching Wooen; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9aed1e2e3dc529e3863b89a60bb4e377e8c3a3e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4488738.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7062771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26110585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication","viral release","calcium ion","replication of viruses","viral life cycle","various viruses","hydrophobic trans-membrane viral proteins","host cell membranes","cellular ion homeostasis","viruses\u2019 replication benefits","various stages","ion channel activity of viroporin","calcium level","functional investigation of viroporins","host defensive programmed cell death pathways","disruption","activation","genome uncoating","contributions","recent developments","hydrophilic pores","pathogenicity","review article","inflammasome","addition","virulence"],"language":"en"},

We previously reported the prevalence of the main respiratory diseases affecting a population of homeless in Marseille, France. Here, we investigated the prevalence of 10 respiratory viruses in a similar homeless population during 2 successive winter seasons. FINDINGS: Following a clinical examination, we collected nasal specimens from which the RT-PCR detection of 10 respiratory viruses was performed through snapshot investigations. Among the 265 patients included, 150 (56.6%) reported at least one respiratory symptom of which 13 (8.7%) had positive swabs for at least one respiratory virus, and 115 patients reported any respiratory symptom of which 10 (8.7%) had positive swabs for respiratory virus. Overall, 23 patients had positive swabs for at least one respiratory virus. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the predominant virus (13 isolates) followed by enteroviruses (3), human metapneumovirus (2), human coronavirus OC43 (2), 229E virus (2) and human respiratory syncytial virus subtype B (1). Among the patients infected with HRV, 10 were collected during the same snapshot. CONCLUSIONS: Although one half of the patients reported respiratory symptoms, the prevalence of respiratory viruses was within the range of that previously described in adult asymptomatic patients outside the homeless community. Most HRV-positive swabs were collected during the same snapshot suggesting a local outbreak. No influenza viruses were found despite the fact that one half of the patients were investigated during the peak of the seasonal influenza epidemic in Marseille.","publish_time":"2014-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiberville, Simon-djamel; Salez, Nicolas; Benkouiten, Samir; Badiaga, Sekene; Charrel, Remi; Brouqui, Philippe","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0da552a101206a82845a47dc3ee9f0a64ed2bac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3918144.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-81; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499605/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Marseille","France"],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","prevalence of respiratory viruses","main respiratory diseases","human respiratory syncytial virus subtype B","HRV-positive swabs","predominant virus","E virus","population of homeless","influenza viruses","adult asymptomatic patients","Homeless shelters","homeless community","human metapneumovirus","Human rhinovirus","similar homeless population","human coronavirus OC43","Marseille","half","snapshot investigations","seasonal influenza epidemic","places","high risk","successive winter seasons","nasal specimens","RT-PCR detection","clinical examination","humans","peak","fact","enteroviruses","isolates","France","range","FINDINGS","local outbreak","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The widespread incorporation of molecular methods into clinical microbiology laboratories has not only led to notable advances in the etiological diagnosis of viral respiratory infections but has also increased insight into the pathology and epidemiological profiles of the causative viruses. Because of their high sensitivity, molecular techniques markedly increase the efficiency of viral detection in respiratory specimens, particularly those that fail to propagate successfully in common cell cultures, thus allowing more rapid etiologic diagnosis. However, there are also some disadvantages in the use of these new technologies such as detection of viruses that merely colonize the respiratory tract of healthy people, or those found in the nasopharyngeal secretions of patients who have recovered from respiratory infections, due to longterm viral shedding, when the viruses are unlikely to act as pathogens.

It is a novel, gene-specific assay that amplifies nucleic acid with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set of six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences of the target gene. This method works with even low copies of DNA and is based on magnesium pyrophosphate turbidity detection by an inexpensive photometer for quantitative analysis. A user-friendly protocol was developed with optimal conditions standardized at 63\u00B0C for 60min. With this protocol, the assay sensitivity was 10 times higher than the widely used YHV nested RT-PCR system. Cross-reactivity analysis using other shrimp virus DNA/cDNA and YHV-negative shrimp demonstrated high specificity of the assay. The real-time RT-LAMP method was performed also for an internal control gene, EF-1\u03B1, to compare with the expressions of the YHV gene in different organs of infected shrimp, and the resulting standard curves showed high correlation coefficient values. These results suggest that this assay is applicable widely as a new quantitative detection method in the pursuit of YHV-free shrimp culture.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mekata, Tohru; Sudhakaran, Raja; Kono, Tomoya; U-taynapun, Kittichon; Supamattaya, Kidchakan; Suzuki, Yoshihiro; Sakai, Masahiro; Itami, Toshiaki","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe770ad4ec94f85e82aa6f57c6580a541ddfeaef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19646483/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409003449; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.07.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409003449","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YHV gene","YHV-negative shrimp","gene-specific assay","pursuit of YHV","shrimp virus DNA","assay sensitivity","target gene","real-time RT-LAMP method","high specificity","free shrimp culture","internal control gene","gene of yellow head virus","new quantitative detection method","YHV nested RT-PCR system","different organs of infected shrimp","isothermal conditions","quantitative analysis","isothermal amplification","high correlation coefficient values","real-time reverse transcription loop","optimal conditions","user-friendly protocol","low copies of DNA","Cross-reactivity analysis","magnesium pyrophosphate turbidity detection","resulting standard curves","inexpensive photometer","nucleic acid","rapidity","cDNA","set","distinct sequences","times higher","designed primers","replicase polyprotein","expressions","novel","Penaeus monodon","results"],"language":"en"},

The current serological assays offered at veterinary diagnostic laboratories for detection of PEDV-specific antibody are based on the U.S. PEDV prototype strain. The objectives of this study were: 1) isolate the U.S. PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain in cell culture; 2) generate antisera against the U.S. PEDV prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains by experimentally infecting weaned pigs; 3) determine if the various PEDV serological assays could detect antibodies against the U.S. PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain and vice versa. RESULTS: A U.S. PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain was isolated in cell culture in this study. Three groups of PEDV-negative, 3-week-old pigs (five pigs per group) were inoculated orally with a U.S. PEDV prototype isolate (previously isolated in our lab), an S-INDEL-variant isolate or virus-negative culture medium. Serum samples collected at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post inoculation were evaluated by the following PEDV serological assays: 1) indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assays using the prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains as indicator viruses; 2) virus neutralization (VN) tests against the prototype and S-INDEL-variant viruses; 3) PEDV prototype strain whole virus based ELISA; 4) PEDV prototype strain S1-based ELISA; and 5) PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain S1-based ELISA. The positive antisera against the prototype strain reacted to and neutralized both prototype and S-INDEL-variant viruses, and the positive antisera against the S-INDEL-variant strain also reacted to and neutralized both prototype and S-INDEL-variant viruses, as examined by IFA antibody assays and VN tests. Antibodies against the two PEDV strains could be detected by all three ELISAs although detection rates varied to some degree. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the antibodies against U.S. PEDV prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains cross-reacted and cross-neutralized both strains in vitro. The current serological assays based on U.S. PEDV prototype strain can detect antibodies against both U.S. PEDV strains.","publish_time":"2016-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Qi; Thomas, Joseph T.; Gim\u00E9nez-Lirola, Luis G.; Hardham, John M.; Gao, Qinshan; Gerber, Priscilla F.; Opriessnig, Tanja; Zheng, Ying; Li, Ganwu; Gauger, Phillip C.; Madson, Darin M.; Magstadt, Drew R.; Zhang, Jianqiang","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de2da69b84bad743d1e16d52a12d4ea8ca9f66d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4820917.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044253/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0697-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","VN","IFA"],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["PEDV S-INDEL","PEDV strains","PEDV prototype isolate","detection of PEDV","groups of PEDV","PEDV prototype strain S1-based ELISA","variant viruses","variant isolate","variant strains cross","following PEDV serological assays","various PEDV serological assays","variant strain S1-based ELISA","current serological assays","antibodies","IFA antibody assays","virus neutralization","indicator viruses","virus-negative culture medium","cell culture","positive antisera","specific antibody","VN tests","week-old pigs","weaned pigs","study","indirect fluorescent antibody","different porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","detection rates","veterinary diagnostic laboratories","United States","days post inoculation","BACKGROUND","ELISAs","degree","data","RESULTS","Serum samples","CONCLUSIONS","objectives"],"language":"en"},

Although various enteric pathogens have been implicated, the aetiology of diarrhoea remains unexplained in a large proportion of HIV-1 infected patients. Our aim is to identify the cause of diarrhoea for patients that remain negative in routine diagnostics. METHODS: In this study stool samples of 196 HIV-1 infected persons, including 29 persons with diarrhoea, were examined for enteropathogens and HIV-1. A search for unknown and unexpected viruses was performed using virus discovery cDNA-AFLP combined with Roche-454 sequencing (VIDISCA-454). RESULTS: HIV-1 RNA was detected in stool of 19 patients with diarrhoea (66%) compared to 75 patients (45%) without diarrhoea. In 19 of the 29 diarrhoea cases a known enteropathogen could be identified (66%). Next to these known causative agents, a range of recently identified viruses was identified via VIDISCA-454: cosavirus, Aichi virus, human gyrovirus, and non-A non-B hepatitis virus. Moreover, a novel virus was detected which was named immunodeficiency-associated stool virus (IASvirus). However, PCR based screening for these viruses showed that none of these novel viruses was associated with diarrhoea. Notably, among the 34% enteropathogen-negative cases, HIV-1 RNA shedding in stool was more frequently observed (80%) compared to enteropathogen-positive cases (47%), indicating that HIV-1 itself is the most likely candidate to be involved in diarrhoea. CONCLUSION: Unexplained diarrhoea in HIV-1 infected patients is probably not caused by recently described or previously unknown pathogens, but it is more likely that HIV-1 itself plays a role in intestinal mucosal abnormalities which leads to diarrhoea.","publish_time":"2014-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oude Munnink, Bas B; Canuti, Marta; Deijs, Martin; de Vries, Michel; Jebbink, Maarten F; Rebers, Sjoerd; Molenkamp, Richard; van Hemert, Formijn J; Chung, Kevin; Cotten, Matthew; Snijders, Fransje; Sol, Cees JA; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3925291.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrhoea cases","Unexplained diarrhoea","particular diarrhoea","aetiology of diarrhoea","cause of diarrhoea","infected patients","non-treated HIV","large proportion of HIV","Aichi virus","infected persons","immunodeficiency-associated stool virus","novel viruses","enteropathogen-negative cases","non-B hepatitis virus","infected individuals","unexpected viruses","known enteropathogen","enteropathogen-positive cases","virus discovery cDNA-AFLP","study stool samples","VIDISCA","unknown pathogens","RNA shedding","likely candidate","known causative agents","various enteric pathogens","human gyrovirus","Roche","cosavirus","role","range","intestinal mucosal abnormalities","Gastrointestinal symptoms","IASvirus","BACKGROUND","sequencing","METHODS","search","routine diagnostics","CONCLUSION","PCR","screening","RESULTS","aim"],"language":"en"},

A key determinant of ability to control the outbreak is the relative timing of infectiousness and symptom onset. We provide a method for identifying this relationship with high accuracy based on data from simulated household-stratified symptom-onset data. Further, this can be achieved with observations taken on only a few specific days, chosen optimally, within each household. The information provided by this method may inform decision making processes for outbreak response. An accurate and computationally-efficient heuristic for determining the optimal surveillance scheme is introduced. This heuristic provides a novel approach to optimal design for Bayesian model discrimination.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cope, Robert C.; Ross, Joshua V.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91a7bdeba621745d246ebd38599661945603acbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094159.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319304485; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.110079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31734243/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319304485","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptom onset","outbreak response","method","simulated household-stratified symptom-onset data","optimal design","efficient heuristic","optimal surveillance scheme","novel approach","Bayesian model discrimination","emerging disease","high accuracy","relative timing of infectiousness","epidemiological characteristics","pathogen","relationship","decision","processes","key determinant of ability","observations","specific days","Abstract","information"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have documented the emergence of recombinants over the last 20 years, with the most recent one, Ck/Aus/N1/08, detected in 2008. These recombinants did not appear to be controlled by the vaccines currently in use. In this study we sequenced the complete genomes of three emergent Australian strains of IBV (IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/88, IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/03 and IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/08) and a previously incompletely characterised vaccine strain, IBV/Ck/Aus/Armidale, and compared them to the genome of the vaccine strain VicS. We detected multiple recombination events throughout the genome between wild type viruses and the vaccine strains in all three emergent isolates. Moreover, we found that strain N1/88 was not entirely exogenous, as was previously hypothesised. Rather, it originated from a recombination event involving the VicS vaccine strain. The S glycoprotein genes of N1/88 and N1/03 were known to be genetically distinct from previously characterised circulating strains and from each other, and the original donors of these genes remains unknown. The S1 glycoprotein gene of N1/88, a subgroup 2 strain, shares a high nucleotide identity with the sequence of the S1 gene of the recent isolate N1/08. As the subgroup 2 strains have not been isolated for at least 20 years, it appears likely that an unknown avian coronavirus that was the donor of the S1 glycoprotein sequence of N1/88 in the 1980s is still recombining with IBV strains in the field.","publish_time":"2016-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quinteros, Jos\u00E9 A.; Lee, Sang-Won; Markham, Philip F.; Noormohammadi, Amir H.; Hartley, Carol A.; Legione, Alistair R.; Coppo, Mauricio J.C.; Vaz, Paola K.; Browning, Glenn F.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73f243f45015fbf2c5cf2d386d58dab89f6163b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117259.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516302693; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516302693; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.11.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV/Ck/Aus/Armidale","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strain N1","IBV strains","vaccine strains","Ck","emergent Australian strains of IBV","S1 glycoprotein sequence of N1","S1 glycoprotein gene of N1","recent isolate N1","S glycoprotein genes of N1","vaccine strain VicS","VicS vaccine strain","characterised vaccine strain","characterised circulating strains","local attenuated strains","years","S1 gene","Abstract Australian strains of infectious bronchitis virus","subgroup","emergent isolates","emergence of recombinants","multiple recombination events","unknown avian coronavirus","wild type viruses","vaccination","complete genomes","high nucleotide identity","control","original donors","Armidale","Previous studies","study","field","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the nutritional status of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA \u2265 24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17\u201323.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score \u003C 17). Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7% were in the malnutrition group. There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups. Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Tao; Zhang, Yalan; Gong, Cheng; Wang, Jing; Liu, Bao; Shi, Li; Duan, Jun","journal":"Eur J Clin Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e547840811d2ff75dc11344c53e949980bc9816c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175450.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0642-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mini Nutritional Assessment"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["risk of malnutrition","malnutrition risk","prevalence of malnutrition","non-malnutrition group","low albumin","elderly patients","low calf circumference","COVID","MNA scores","independent risk factors","combined diabetes","related factors","nutritional status of elderly inpatients","nutritional support","Regression analysis","incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus","Mini Nutritional Assessment","cross-sectional study","body mass index","BMI","screen","hemoglobin","statistical differences","METHODS","lymphocyte","treatment","Wuhan","SUBJECTS","OBJECTIVES","China","RESULTS","total","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","groups"],"language":"en"},

Due to successful immunization programs we rarely hear about some of the common diseases of the early twentieth century including small pox and polio. Vaccination programs have also helped to increase food production notably poultry, cattle, and milk production due to lower incidence of infectious diseases in farm animals. Though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines. Currently there are no vaccines for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS, and parasitic diseases including malaria. Abuse of antibiotics has resulted in the generation of several antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains; hence there is a need to develop novel vaccines for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Changes in climate is another concern for vaccinologists. Climate change could lead to generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms that would require development of novel vaccines. Use of conventional vaccination strategies to develop vaccines has severe limitations; hence innovative strategies are essential in the development of novel and effective vaccines.","publish_time":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Sunil; Dilbarova, Rima; Rappuoli, Rino","journal":"Vaccine Design","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d0664c3be770994d502f1d1baae42684652aad4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121569.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27076124/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-3387-7_2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autoimmune diseases","neurodegenerative diseases","parasitic diseases","common diseases","effective vaccines","development of novel vaccines","Vaccination programs","lower incidence of infectious diseases","conventional vaccination strategies","generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms","antibiotic-resistant microorganisms","antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains","successful immunization programs","innovative strategies","milk production","food production","Climate change","century","severe limitations","AIDS","poultry","cattle","tuberculosis","cancer","farm animals","lives","small pox","cheapest health-care interventions","need","polio","concern","malaria","quality of life","drugs","therapies","Changes","vaccinologists","Abuse of antibiotics"],"language":"en"}]}

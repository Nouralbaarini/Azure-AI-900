We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong. Methods We included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables. We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge. We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients\u2019age and the time from onset to admission. Findings After the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.2\u20137.7). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8\u201316.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2\u201352.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric \u03B3 distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0\u20139.6) and 55.0% (45.3\u201364.7), respectively. Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic. Interpretation Patients\u2019age was strongly associated with outcome. The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.

Moreover, coronavirus-like particles have been seen by electron microscope in stools, and SARS-HCoV has been isolated from intestinal tissue and detected in stool samples. Objectives To find out if HCoVs can be found in stools of children with acute gastroenteritis and to assess the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in children. Study design 878 stool specimens from children with acute gastroenteritis and 112 from control children were tested by RT-PCR to detect HCoV groups 1B, 2A and SARS. HCoVs were typed by sequencing all PCR positive samples. Results Twenty-two (2.5%) of the 878 stool specimens of children with acute gastroenteritis were positive for HCoVs. The following HCoV types were detected: OC43 (10 cases, 45.5%), HKU1 (6 cases, 27.3%), 229E (2 cases, 9.1%) and NL63 (4 cases, 18.2%). In 4 of the cases a HCoV was the only detected virus; in the remaining cases rotavirus or norovirus was found in the same sample. In control groups there were two HCoV positive samples of 112 tested. Conclusions This study shows that all known non-SARS HCoVs can be found in stools of children with acute gastroenteritis. On the basis of this study, the significance of coronaviruses as gastrointestinal pathogens in children appears minor, since most of the coronavirus findings were co-infections with known gastroenteritis viruses.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Risku, Minna; Lappalainen, Suvi; R\u00E4s\u00E4nen, Sirpa; Vesikari, Timo","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b41df264d863333c9269f990fabe4d751384267.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108425.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.02.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210000855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20233673/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210000855","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stools of children","control children","etiology of acute gastroenteritis","stool specimens of children","SARS-HCoV","significance of HCoVs","HCoV positive samples","HCoV groups","known gastroenteritis viruses","known non-SARS HCoVs","stool samples","PCR positive samples","remaining cases rotavirus","following HCoV types","significance of coronaviruses","Study design","control groups","detected virus","RT-PCR","gastrointestinal pathogens","coronavirus findings","respiratory pathogens","Abstract Background Human coronaviruses","co-infections","norovirus","electron microscope","OC43","intestinal tissue","particles","basis","Conclusions","HKU1","NL63","Objectives","Results"],"language":"en"},

We examined the pathogenic effects of the viruses in chicken embryos and the size and morphology of the virus particles, performed phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene and complete genomic sequences, and examined the antibody responses against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The results suggested that the viruses I0623/17 and I0710/17 were avian coronaviruses and were identified as pheasant coronaviruses (PhCoV), with greatest similarity to IBV. Further investigations of the antigenicity, complete genome organization, substitutions in multiple genes, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants showed obvious differences between PhCoV and IBV in terms of antigenicity, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants. The close genetic relationship, but obvious differences between PhCoVs and IBVs suggested the IBVs could be the ancestors of PhCoVs, and that PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks may have evolved independently from IBVs circulating in the specific region by adaption in pheasants. This hypothesis was supported by analysis of the S1 gene fragments of the two PhCoVs isolated in the current study, as well as PhCoVs isolated in the UK and selected IBV strains. Such analyses indicated different evolution patterns and different tissue tropisms between PhCoVs isolated in different outbreaks. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis by studying the complete genomic sequences of PhCoVs from different outbreaks and the pathogenicity of IBVs in pheasants to compare and clarify the relationships between PhCoVs and IBVs.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Zongxi; Liwen, Xu; Ren, Mengting; Sheng, Jie; Ma, Tianxin; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e17c8d64641ade812c9fa55a8b18ba5ed472204.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117390.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31902509/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519309253; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519309253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","UK"],"locations":["Shandong","China"],"keyphrases":["ancestors of PhCoVs","different outbreaks","pathogenicity of IBVs","complete genomic sequences of PhCoVs","commercial pheasants","viral pathogenicity","different tissue tropisms","different evolution patterns","obvious differences","replication","selected IBV strains","viruses I0623","chickens","hypothesis","complete genome organization","S1 gene fragments","terms of antigenicity","virus particles","phylogenetic analysis","pheasant coronaviruses","avian coronaviruses","infectious bronchitis virus","Shandong","mortality","substitutions","multiple genes","severe clinical signs","size","antibody responses","chicken embryos","morphology","Anhui provinces","close genetic relationship","I0710","specific region","analyses","UK","pathogenic effects","greatest similarity","China","adaption","investigations","current study","relationships","results","studies"],"language":"en"},

We asked how structured and free-text narrative EMR data should be combined to improve epidemic surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODS: Eight previously characterized ARI case detection algorithms (CDA) were applied to historical EMR entries to create authentic time series of daily ARI case counts (background). An epidemic model simulated influenza cases (injection). From the time of the injection, cluster-detection statistics were applied daily on paired background\u002Binjection (combined) and background-only time series. This cycle was then repeated with the injection shifted to each week of the evaluation year. We computed: a) the time from injection to the first statistical alarm uniquely found in the combined dataset (Detection Delay); b) how often alarms originated in the background-only dataset (false-alarm rate, or FAR); and c) the number of cases found within these false alarms (Caseload). For each CDA, we plotted the Detection Delay as a function of FAR or Caseload, over a broad range of alarm thresholds. RESULTS: CDAs that combined text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes with provider-assigned diagnostic codes in order to maximize the precision rather than the sensitivity of case-detection lowered Detection Delay at any given FAR or Caseload. CONCLUSION: An empiric approach can guide the integration of EMR data into case-detection methods that improve both the timeliness and efficiency of epidemic detection.","publish_time":"2014-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Hongzhang; Gaff, Holly; Smith, Gary; DeLisle, Sylvain","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4090236.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006878/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100845","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["EMR","CDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Detection Delay","injection","case-detection methods","efficiency of epidemic detection","characterized ARI case detection algorithms","cluster-detection statistics","Caseload","combined dataset","authentic time series of daily ARI case counts","ARI symptoms","sensitivity of case","paired background","integration of EMR data","historical EMR entries","free-text narrative EMR data","epidemic surveillance","false-alarm rate","statistical alarm","false alarms","epidemic model simulated influenza cases","text analyses","number of cases","broad range of alarm thresholds","provider","clinical notes","diagnostic codes","acute respiratory infections","timeliness","Electronic medical records","order","rich repository of information","BACKGROUNDS","precision","CDAs","empiric approach","RESULTS","week","function","public health","evaluation year","CONCLUSION","cycle"],"language":"en"},

Although no licensed vaccine is currently available, an engineered version of the metastable RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein\u2014stabilized in the pre-fusion (pre-F) conformation by \u201CDS-Cav1\u201D mutations\u2014elicits high titer RSV-neutralizing responses. Moreover, pre-F-specific antibodies, often against the neutralization-sensitive antigenic site \u00D8 in the membrane-distal head region of trimeric F glycoprotein, comprise a substantial portion of the human response to natural RSV infection. To focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site \u00D8, we designed a series of RSV F immunogens that comprised the membrane-distal head of the F glycoprotein in its pre-F conformation. These \u201Chead-only\u201D immunogens formed monomers, dimers, and trimers. Antigenic analysis revealed that a majority of the 70 engineered head-only immunogens displayed reactivity to site \u00D8-targeting antibodies, which was similar to that of the parent RSV F DS-Cav1 trimers, often with increased thermostability. We evaluated four of these head-only immunogens in detail, probing their recognition by antibodies, their physical stability, structure, and immunogenicity. When tested in na\u00EFve mice, a head-only trimer, half the size of the parent RSV F trimer, induced RSV titers, which were statistically comparable to those induced by DS-Cav1. When used to boost DS-Cav1-primed mice, two head-only RSV F immunogens, a dimer and a trimer, boosted RSV-neutralizing titers to levels that were comparable to those boosted by DS-Cav1, although with higher site \u00D8-directed responses. Our results provide proof-of-concept for the ability of the smaller head-only RSV F immunogens to focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site \u00D8. Decent primary immunogenicity, enhanced physical stability, potential ease of manufacture, and potent immunogenicity upon boosting suggest these head-only RSV F immunogens, engineered to retain the pre-fusion conformation, may have advantages as candidate RSV vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyington, Jeffrey C.; Joyce, M.

Geoffroy, 1803","doi":"10.1186/s13071-019-3300-7","pmcid":"PMC6343336","pubmed_id":"30674343","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Babesiae are erythrocytic protozoans, which infect the red blood cells of vertebrate hosts to cause disease. Previous studies have described potentially pathogenic infections of Babesia vesperuginis in insectivorous bats in Europe, the Americas and Asia. To date, no babesial infections have been documented in the bats of Madagascar, or in any frugivorous bat species worldwide. RESULTS: We used standard microscopy and conventional PCR to identify babesiae in blood from the endemic Madagascan flying fox (Pteropus rufus). Out of 203 P. rufus individuals captured between November 2013 and January 2016 and screened for erythrocytic parasites, nine adult males (4.43%) were infected with babesiae. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences obtained from positive samples indicates that they cluster in the Babesia microti clade, which typically infect felids, rodents, primates, and canids, but are distinct from B. vesperuginis previously described in bats. Statistical analysis of ecological trends in the data suggests that infections were most commonly observed in the rainy season and in older-age individuals. No pathological effects of infection on the host were documented; age-prevalence patterns indicated susceptible-infectious (SI) transmission dynamics characteristic of a non-immunizing persistent infection. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first report of any erythrocytic protozoan infecting Madagascan fruit bats and the first record of a babesial infection in a pteropodid fruit bat globally. Given the extent to which fruit bats have been implicated as reservoirs for emerging human pathogens, any new record of their parasite repertoire and transmission dynamics offers notable insights into our understanding of the ecology of emerging pathogens.

Vaccination is the important prevention means against both infections. To achieve a PRV genome-based virus live vector, aiming at further TGEV/PRV bivalent vaccine development, a recombinant plasmid pUG was constructed via inserting partial PK and full-length gG genes of PRV strain Bartha K-61 amplified into pUC119 vector. In parallel, another recombinant pHS was generated by introducing a fragment designated S1 encoding the major antigen sites of S gene from TGEV strain TH-98 into a prokaryotic expression vector pPROEX HTc. The SV40 polyA sequence was then inserted into the downstream of S1 fragment of pHS. The continuous region containing S1fragment, SV40 polyA and four single restriction enzyme sites digested from pHS was subcloned into the downstream of gG promoter of pUG. In addition, a LacZ reporter gene was introduced into the universal transfer vector named pUGS-LacZ. Subsequently, a PRV genome-based virus live vector was generated via homologous recombination. The functionally effective vector was purified and partially characterized. Moreover, the potential advantages of this system are discussed.","publish_time":"2007-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Jiechao; Ren, Xiaofeng; Tian, Zhijun; Li, Yijing","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9c4c049c23e0178cae716432eb6a249bec6c8f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128284.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105606000261; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105606000261","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRV genome-based virus live vector","pUC119 vector","effective vector","pseudorabies virus","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","universal transfer vector","recombinant pHS","downstream of S1 fragment of pHS","PRV bivalent vaccine development","full-length gG genes of PRV strain Bartha","TGEV strain TH","prokaryotic expression vector pPROEX HTc","downstream of gG promoter of pUG","recombinant plasmid pUG","LacZ reporter gene","SV40 polyA sequence","fragment designated S1","pUGS-LacZ","major antigen sites of S gene","single restriction enzyme sites","partial PK","severe porcine infectious diseases","S1fragment","serious economic loss","animal husbandry","continuous region","homologous recombination","important prevention","addition","potential advantages","system","Vaccination","infections"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we demonstrated that the lack of binding of Beaudette S1 was not due to absence of virus receptors on this tissue nor due to the production of S1 from mammalian cells, as S1 proteins expressed from chicken cells also lacked the ability to bind IBV-susceptible embryonic tissue. Subsequently, we addressed the contribution of the S2 subunit of the spike in IBV attachment. Recombinant IBV Beaudette spike ectodomains, comprising the entire S1 domain and the S2 ectodomain, were expressed and analyzed for binding to susceptible embryonic chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) in our previously developed spike histochemistry assay. We observed that extension of the S1 domain with the S2 subunit of the Beaudette spike was sufficient to gain binding to CAM. A previously suggested heparin sulfate binding site in Beaudette S2 was not required for the observed binding to CAM, while sialic acids on the host tissues were essential for the attachment. To further elucidate the role of S2 the spike ectodomains of virulent IBV M41 and chimeras of M41 and Beaudette were analyzed for their binding to CAM, chicken trachea and mammalian cell lines. While the M41 spike ectodomain showed increased attachment to both CAM and chicken trachea, no binding to mammalian cells was observed. In contrast, Beaudette spike ectodomain had relatively weak ability to bind to chicken trachea, but displayed marked extended host range to mammalian cells. Binding patterns of chimeric spike ectodomains to these tissues and cells indicate that S2 subunits most likely do not contain an additional independent receptor-binding site. Rather, the interplay between S1 and S2 subunits of spikes from the same viral origin might finally determine the avidity and specificity of virus attachment and thus viral host range.","publish_time":"2013-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Promkuntod, N.; Wickramasinghe, I.

Host shutoff limits host innate immune responses and may also redirect the translation apparatus to the production of viral proteins. Multiple IAV proteins regulate host shutoff, including PA-X, a ribonuclease that remains incompletely characterized. We report that PA-X selectively targets host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed mRNAs, while sparing products of Pol I and Pol III. Interestingly, we show that PA-X can also target Pol II-transcribed RNAs in the nucleus, including non-coding RNAs that are not destined to be translated, and reporter transcripts with RNA hairpin structures that block ribosome loading. Transcript degradation likely occurs in the nucleus, as PA-X is enriched in the nucleus and its nuclear localization correlates with reduction in target RNA levels. Complete degradation of host mRNAs following PA-X-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage is dependent on the host 5\u2019-\u003E3\u2019-exonuclease Xrn1. IAV mRNAs are structurally similar to host mRNAs, but are synthesized and modified at the 3\u2019 end by the action of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. Infection of cells with wild-type IAV or a recombinant PA-X-deficient virus revealed that IAV mRNAs resist PA-X-mediated degradation during infection. At the same time, loss of PA-X resulted in changes in the synthesis of select viral mRNAs and a decrease in viral protein accumulation. Collectively, these results significantly advance our understanding of IAV host shutoff, and suggest that the PA-X causes selective degradation of host mRNAs by discriminating some aspect of Pol II-dependent RNA biogenesis in the nucleus.","publish_time":"2016-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khaperskyy, Denys A.; Schmaling, Summer; Larkins-Ford, Jonah; McCormick, Craig; Gaglia, Marta M.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39a1d7e4cf03a63037800c831965232d1d259e0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4744033.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26849127/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pol III"],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Host shutoff limits host","host RNA polymerase","recombinant PA-X","IAV mRNAs","selective degradation of host mRNAs","Complete degradation of host mRNAs","viral mRNAs","understanding of IAV host shutoff","loss of PA","transcribed mRNAs","host gene expression","nucleus","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex","dependent RNA biogenesis","target RNA levels","mediated degradation","aspect of Pol","products of Pol","RNA hairpin structures","Multiple IAV proteins","Transcript degradation","wild-type IAV","production of viral proteins","viral protein accumulation","transcribed RNAs","Infection of cells","mediated endonucleolytic cleavage","non-coding RNAs","deficient virus","reduction","nuclear localization correlates","immune responses","IAVs","decrease","process","translation apparatus","reporter transcripts","ribosome loading","viruses","action","synthesis","changes","time","Influenza","results","ribonuclease","exonuclease Xrn1"],"language":"en"},

Experimental infection was conducted in 90-day-old chickens, embryonated eggs and bioassays in dogs. In the first experiment, poults were randomly divided into four groups. Groups I and II were provided feed with coccidiostat, whereas groups III and IV received feed without coccidiostat. When the poults from groups I and III reached 90 days of age, they received a subcutaneous inoculation of N. caninum. Once the hens entered their egg-laying period, during the following 30 days, the eggs were collected, identified, weighed and placed in an incubator. On the 70th day after inoculation, all animals, including the chicks, were euthanized. Tissue samples from the adult poultry and chicks were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. Brain tissue and pectoral muscle samples from infected birds were fed to two dogs. Notably, the average weight of the group III eggs was lower than that of the group IV eggs (p \u003C0.05). No changes consistent with infection in adult poultry or chicks were detected by histopathology or IHC; moreover, no amplified parasite DNA was detected in the birds\u2019 tissues or dogs\u2019 feces. No dog eliminated oocysts. In the second experiment, the embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with 1\u00D7102 N. caninum tachyzoites, on the 10th day of incubation, and chicks born from these eggs were housed in boxes suitable for the species and received commercial feed and distilled water ad libitum. On the 30th day after infection (DAI), the poultry were euthanized, and their organs were processed as described in experiment I. The amplification of parasite DNA was observed in the spleen and pectoral muscles of one of the birds. The ingestion of bird tissues by dogs did not result in oocyst elimination. These results indicate that the parasite may have been eliminated by the host and that the use of tachyzoites to induce chronic disease might be a poor source for hens.","publish_time":"2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munhoz, Alexandre Dias; Amaral, Tatiane Fernanda do; Gon\u00E7alves, Luiz Ricardo; Moraes, Vera Maria Barbosa de; Machado, Rosangela Zacarias","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a67712c8a7565893fd5fd1b1fdf91d8c96fa3c72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127050.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401714005366; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401714005366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["PCR","IHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chicks","embryonated eggs","groups","embryonated chicken eggs","adult poultry","Experimental infection","Neospora caninum tachyzoites","commercial feed","Tissue samples","use of tachyzoites","IHC","histopathology","amplified parasite DNA","amplification of parasite DNA","day of incubation","coccidiostat","hens","IV","poults","Gallus gallus domesticus","pectoral muscle samples","infected birds","birds\u2019 tissues","pectoral muscles","Brain tissue","subcutaneous inoculation of","days of age","ingestion of bird tissues","distilled water ad libitum","chronic disease","species","bioassays","day-old chickens","poor source","period","spleen","immunohistochemistry","changes consistent","boxes suitable","dogs\u2019 feces","average weight","animals","DAI","PCR","oocyst elimination","host","strain","study","organs","oocysts","aim","results","incubator"],"language":"en"},

Three copies of it have been connected to a tripodal platform based on 2,4,6-triethylbenzene-1,3,5-trimethylamine. The tripodal template 2 is even more structured than 1 thus suggesting a significant interaction between the three sequences connected to the platform. Preliminary inhibition assays of HIV-mediated cell fusion indicated that while the single peptide 1 is inactive within the concentration range of our assay, when it is conjugated to the tripodal platform, it is moderately active.

Internal quality assurance (IQA) could mitigate the limitations of internal quality control, competency assessment and external quality assurance, adding a longitudinal insight, including pre- and post-analytical steps. Here, we implemented an IQA program in our clinical microbiology facilities with blind resubmission of routine samples during 22 months. One-hundred-and-twenty-one out of 123 (98.4%) serological analyses and 112 out of 122 (91.8%) molecular analyses were concordant. Among the discordances in molecular biology analyses, 6 results were low positive samples that turned out negative, likely due to stochastic repartition of nucleic acids. Moreover, one identified retranscription error led us to implement automated results transmission from the Applied Biosystems instruments to the laboratory information system (LIS). Regarding Gram stain microscopy, 560 out of 745 (75.2%) of compared parameters were concordant. As many as 67 out of 84 (79.8%) pairs of culture results were similar, including 16 sterile pairs, 27 having identical identification or description and semi-quantification and 24 only showing variations in semi-quantification with identical description or identification of colonies. Seventeen pairs had diverging identification or description of colonies. Culture was twice only done for one member of the pairs. Regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing, a major discrepancy was observed in 5 out of 48 results (10.4%). In conclusion, serological tests were highly reproducible. Molecular diagnosis also revealed to be robust except when the amounts of nucleic acids present in the sample were close to the limits of detection. Conventional microbiology was less robust with major discrepancies reaching 39.5% of the samples for microscopy. Similarly, culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing were prone to discrepancies. This work was ground for reconsidering multiples aspects of our practices and demonstrates the importance of IQA to complete the other quality management procedures.","publish_time":"2017-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scherz, Valentin; Durussel, Christian; Greub, Gilbert","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/904be1b54f8b7ce0eba0f553eedc70dbb78f138d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5685576.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29135992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Applied Biosystems"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pairs of culture results","importance of microbiology results","Internal quality assurance","molecular analyses","external quality assurance","identical identification","identical description","identification of colonies","importance of IQA","description of colonies","sterile pairs","serological analyses","high quality standards","automated results transmission","quality management procedures","molecular biology analyses","limitations of internal quality control","semi-quantification","Conventional microbiology","antibiotic susceptibility testing","IQA program","major discrepancies","Molecular diagnosis","clinical microbiology facilities","low positive samples","blind resubmission of routine samples","stochastic repartition of nucleic acids","amounts of nucleic acids present","major discrepancy","serological tests","Gram stain microscopy","Applied Biosystems instruments","competency assessment","patient care","longitudinal insight","variations","laboratory information system","reconsidering multiples aspects","practices","work","ground","post-analytical steps","LIS","identified retranscription error","conclusion","months","discordances","limits of detection","parameters","member"],"language":"en"},

The double burden of infectious and chronic diseases constitutes major causes of morbidity and mortality. Over the last two decades, there has been a rise in infectious diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), the H1N1 pandemic influenza, the Ebolavirus and the Covid-19 virus. These diseases have rapidly spread across the world and have reminded us of the unprecedented connectivity that defines our modern civilization. Though some countries have made substantial progress toward improving global surveillance for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), the vast majority of Low-and Middle-income Countries (LMICs) with fragile health systems and various system-related bottlenecks remain vulnerable to outbreaks and, as such, experience dramatic social and economic consequences when they are reported. Lessons learned from past outbreaks suggest that gender inequalities are common across a range of health issues relating to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), with women being particularly disadvantaged, partially due to the burden placed on them. Though these countries are striving to improve their health systems and be more inclusive to this vulnerable group, the national/ global outbreaks have burdened the overall system and thus paralyzed normal services dedicated to the delivery of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services.

The host\u2013pathogen relationship in COPD is a complex, dynamic process characterised by frequent changes in pathogens, their strains and loads, and subsequent host immune responses. Exacerbations are detrimental events in the course of COPD and evidence suggests that 70% may be caused by microorganisms. When considering bacterial exacerbations, recent findings based on molecular typing have demonstrated that the acquisition of new strains of bacteria or antigenic changes in pre-existing strains are the most important triggers for exacerbation onset. Even in clinically stable COPD patients the presence of microorganisms in their lower airways may cause harmful effects and induce chronic low-grade airway inflammation leading to increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function and impaired health-related quality of life. Besides intraluminal localisation in the distal airways, bacteria can be found in the bronchial walls and parenchymal lung tissue of COPD patients. Therefore, the isolation of pathogenic bacteria in stable COPD should be considered as a form of chronic infection rather than colonisation. This new approach may have important implications for the management of patients with COPD.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matkovic, Zinka; Miravitlles, Marc","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/163f5cb9d4d18dda324d70d6b3a100c208434941.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23218452/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2012.10.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611112004106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611112004106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stable COPD patients","course of COPD","lower airways of COPD patients","parenchymal lung tissue of COPD patients","acquisition of new strains of bacteria","management of patients","pre-existing strains","isolation of pathogenic bacteria","distal airways","stable state","presence of microorganisms","bacterial exacerbations","Summary Microorganisms","lung function","frequent changes","antigenic changes","important triggers","important implications","exacerbation onset","new approach","increased exacerbation frequency","form of chronic infection","chronic low-grade airway inflammation","subsequent host immune responses","accelerated decline","harmful effects","impaired health-related quality of life","complex","loads","dynamic process","recent findings","pathogens","bronchial walls","molecular typing","pathogen relationship","detrimental events","intraluminal localisation","colonisation","evidence"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing FB after allo\u2010HSCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology from January 2013 to December 2016. We used PCR to detect various viruses in FB specimens, particularly for 27 viruses. RESULTS: One hundred forty\u2010nine diagnostic FBs were performed in 130 patients. The overall diagnostic yield was 58%. Eighty\u2010nine percent of the patients with a positive FB result were diagnosed with a pulmonary infection. Viruses were the most common infectious diagnosis (70%), followed by fungi (48%), bacteria (38%), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (12%). Multivariate analyses showed that a chest computed tomography (CT) finding of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (P = .012) and positive results in assisted microbiological and serological analyses (P = .000) predicted a positive FB result.

Secondary data from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007 were obtained from the Ghana National AIDS Control Programme and Biostatistics Department of the Health Ministry. Intervention time series analysis was applied separately to the data from the northern and southern sectors due to data collection mechanism and location of two tertiary teaching hospitals. The impact of GAC activities is measured by the statistical significance of the coefficients of the intervention variable. The intervention variable is coded as zero (0) for the period before and one (1), the period after the GAC activities commenced. It was shown that the HIV incidence in the northern follows an integrated moving average model, whilst in the southern sectors an autoregressive integrated moving average model was the appropriate model. No significant impact of GAC activities was observed in the northern sector. In contrast the GAC activities in the southern sector were associated with a reduction in new HIV infections (male=\u22120.20\u00B10.13, p \u003C0.05; female=0.14\u00B10.10, p \u003C0.05), corresponding to a 15% and 18% reduction in male and female new HIV infections respectively in the sector. It can therefore be concluded that the GAC activities were a success. However, greater focus of GAC efforts in the northern sector is required to ensure that its activities have an impact on the incidence there.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aboagye-Sarfo, Patrick; Mueller, Ute; Cross, James","journal":"HIV \u0026 AIDS Review","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f96669b6a853f3d0befdfe41836eacb9418d9a92.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1730127015000314; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1730127015000314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ghana AIDS Commission","GAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant impact of GAC activities","northern sector","female new HIV infections","HIV incidence","southern sectors","greater focus of GAC efforts","intervention variable","impact of Ghana AIDS Commission","autoregressive integrated moving average model","appropriate model","reduction","Secondary data","period","data collection mechanism","Intervention time series analysis","Ghana National AIDS Control Programme","Biostatistics Department","location","tertiary teaching hospitals","coefficients","statistical significance","Health Ministry","study","success"],"language":"en"},

Here, we provide new significant insights on the involvement of lipids in the structure and function of the CoV E protein channel on the basis of three series of experiments. First, reversal potential measurements over a wide range of pH allow the dissection of the contributions to channel selectivity coming from ionizable residues of the protein transmembrane domain and also from the negatively charged groups of diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine (DPhPS) lipid. The corresponding effective pKas are consistent with the model pKas of the acidic residue candidates for titration. Second, the change of channel conductance with salt concentration reveals two distinct regimes (Donnan-controlled electrodiffusion and bulk-like electrodiffusion) fully compatible with the outcomes of selectivity experiments. Third, by measuring channel conductance in mixtures of neutral diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids and negatively charged DPhPS lipids in low and high salt concentrations we conclude that the protein\u2013lipid conformation in the channel is likely the same in charged and neutral lipids. Overall, the whole set of experiments supports the proteolipidic structure of SARS-CoV E channels and explains the large difference in channel conductance observed between neutral and charged membranes.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verdi\u00E1-B\u00E1guena, Carmina; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Alcaraz, Antonio; DeDiego, Marta L.; Enjuanes, Luis; Aguilella, Vicente M.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b45941ca51d3a1efa379dcb5b0c56b23ed0729a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3715572.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2013.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23688394/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273613001545; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0005273613001545","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV E protein channel","channel selectivity","neutral lipids","change of channel conductance","DPhPS lipids","CoV E channels","involvement of lipids","protein transmembrane domain","outcomes of selectivity experiments","set of experiments","series of experiments","mixtures of neutral diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine","proteolipidic structure of SARS","model pKas","SARS coronavirus","ion channels","lipid conformation","Donnan-controlled electrodiffusion","high salt concentrations","corresponding effective pKas","groups of diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine","distinct regimes","ionizable residues","dissection","DPhPC","wide range of pH","large difference","basis","function","acidic residue candidates","bulk","contributions","envelope","reversal potential measurements","new significant insights","titration","partial characterization","membranes","Verdi\u00E1-B\u00E1guena"],"language":"en"},

Thus, our data indicated the induction of cross-protective VN antibodies by D/KV/ADJ vaccine, and importantly demonstrated that an inactivated PRRSV vaccine could also induce cross-protective response across the viral genotype.","publish_time":"2016-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tabynov, Kairat; Sansyzbay, Abylay; Tulemissova, Zhanara; Tabynov, Kaissar; Dhakal, Santosh; Samoltyrova, Aigul; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.; Mambetaliyev, Muratbay","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e091f4356b605ca9b9922f3e374e506bf354120.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.06.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516301778; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516301778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27527768/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ST (D/KV/ADJ","VN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivated PRRSV vaccine","ADJ vaccine","PRRSV strain","KV","commercial killed PRRSV vaccine","commercial vaccine","ADJ vaccinated pigs","candidate vaccine","Kazakh strains of PRRSV type","clinical disease","homologous vaccine strain LKZ","heterogeneous type","macroscopic lung lesions","protective VN antibodies","generation of VN antibodies","Clinical parameters","clinical protection","viral genotype","respiratory syndrome virus","respiratory disease scores","cross-protective response","challenged field isolates","RIBSP Republic of Kazakhstan","viral load","induction of cross","absence of viremia","novel BEI-inactivated porcine reproductive","quantitative real-time PCR","lungs","NVDC-JXA1","cell culture assay","body temperature","antibody titers","immunological profiles","ELISA","Gel","adjuvant Montanide","swine herds","efficacy","contrast","genotypes","data","results"],"language":"en"},

The task force hopes to help healthcare workers, particularly anesthesiologists, optimize the care of their patients and protect patients, healthcare workers, and the public from becoming infected. The recommendations were created mainly based on the practice and experience of anesthesiologists who provide care to patients in China. Therefore, adoption of these recommendations outside of China must be done with caution, and the local environment, culture, uniqueness of the healthcare system, and patients\u2019 needs should be considered.

The worldwide prevalence of FIV infection in domestic cats has been reported to range from 1 to 28%. Hence, an effective FIV vaccine will have an important impact on veterinary medicine in addition to being used as a small animal AIDS model for humans. Since the discovery of FIV reported in 1987, FIV vaccine research has pursued both molecular and conventional vaccine approaches toward the development of a commercial product. Published FIV vaccine trial results from 1998 to the present have been compiled to update the veterinary clinical and research communities on the immunologic and experimental efficacy status of these vaccines. A brief report is included on the outcome of the 10 years of collaborative work between industry and academia which led to recent USDA approval of the first animal lentivirus vaccine, the dual-subtype FIV vaccine. The immunogenicity and efficacy of the experimental prototype, dual-subtype FIV vaccine and the efficacy of the currently approved commercial, dual-subtype FIV vaccine (Fel-O-Vax FIV) are discussed. Potential cross-reactivity complications between commercial FIV diagnostic tests, Idexx Snap Combo Test\u00AE and Western blot assays, and sera from previously vaccinated cats are also discussed. Finally, recommendations are made for unbiased critical testing of new FIV vaccines, the currently USDA approved vaccine, and future vaccines in development.","publish_time":"2002-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uhl, E.

Circumstances can however, change dramatically due to emergencies, disasters, or pandemics and may make it difficult to meet the standard of care in the way nurses are accustomed. The Australian nursing profession has not yet facilitated a broad discussion and debate at the professional and institutional level about adapting standards of care under extreme conditions, a dialogue which goes beyond the content of basic emergency and disaster preparedness. The purpose of this paper is to encourage discussion within the nursing profession on this important ethical and legal issue. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken to determine the state of the evidence in relation to adapting standards of care under extreme conditions. Content analysis of the literature identified categories related to adapting standards of care that have been considered by individuals or groups that should be considered in Australia, should a dialogue be undertaken. The categories include ethical expectations of professional practice; legal interpretation of care requirements, resource priority between hospital and public health and informing communities. Literature reviews and commentary may provide the background for a national dialogue on the nursing response in an extreme event. However, it is only with the engagement of a broadly representative segment of the professional nursing community that appropriate guidance on adapting standards of care under extreme conditions can be developed and then integrated into the professional worldview of nursing in Australia.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cusack, Lynette; Gebbie, Kristine","journal":"Collegian","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cccde955a264d05967836168d2d642dc6edbf9e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110603.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1322769615000803; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1322769615000803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["adapting standards of care","standard of care","professional nursing community","professional worldview of nursing","extreme conditions","aspects of patient care","nursing response","legal interpretation of care requirements","Australian nursing profession","common understanding of nursing\u0027s professional standards","extreme event","ethical expectations of professional practice","categories","Literature reviews","national dialogue","circumstances","legal issue","Content analysis","broad discussion","content of basic emergency","resource priority","hospital","appropriate guidance","public health","debate","representative segment","institutional level","disaster preparedness","background","way nurses","matter","relation","pandemics","Summary Clinical practices","communities","commentary","state","evidence","emergencies","disasters","engagement","paper","groups","comprehensive review","individuals","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, CD8(\u002B) T-cells represent the predominant T-cell population in human MS lesions and are oligoclonally expanded at the site of pathology. However, their role in the autoimmune pathologic process has been both understudied and controversial. Several animal models and MS patient studies support a pathogenic role for CNS-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cells, whereas we and others have demonstrated a regulatory role for these cells in disease. In this review, we describe studies that have investigated the role of CD8(\u002B) T-cells in MS and EAE, presenting evidence for both pathogenic and regulatory functions. In our studies, we have shown that cytotoxic/suppressor CD8(\u002B) T-cells are CNS antigen-specific, MHC class I-restricted, IFN\u03B3- and perforin-dependent, and are able to inhibit disease. The clinical relevance for CD8(\u002B) T-cell suppressive function is best described by a lack of their function during MS relapse, and importantly, restoration of their suppressive function during quiescence. Furthermore, CD8(\u002B) T-cells with immunosuppressive functions can be therapeutically induced in MS patients by glatiramer acetate (GA) treatment. Unlike CNS-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cells, these immunosuppressive GA-induced CD8(\u002B) T-cells appear to be HLA-E restricted. These studies have provided greater fundamental insight into the role of autoreactive as well as therapeutically induced CD8(\u002B) T-cells in disease amelioration. The clinical implications for these findings are immense and we propose that this natural process can be harnessed toward the development of an effective immunotherapeutic strategy.","publish_time":"2015-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sinha, Sushmita; Boyden, Alexander W.; Itani, Farah R.; Crawford, Michael P.; Karandikar, Nitin J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1963d550043eb5a1d7c49a21530848025ac4eb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4674574.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26697014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAE","CNS","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cells","role of CD8","CNS-specific CD8","suppressor CD8","T-cell suppressive function","MS patient studies","immunosuppressive GA-induced CD8","predominant T-cell population","MS patients","MS relapse","pathogenic role","regulatory role","role of autoreactive","human MS lesions","immune basis of MS","regulators of disease","disease amelioration","CNS antigen-specific","vast majority of studies","EAE","immunosuppressive functions","regulatory functions","animal models","natural process","clinical implications","clinical relevance","autoimmune pathologic process","MHC class","IFN\u03B3","glatiramer acetate","restoration","evidence","greater fundamental insight","development","lack","mediators","perforin-dependent","effective immunotherapeutic strategy","findings","treatment","quiescence","CD4","HLA-E","site of pathology","review"],"language":"en"},

Breastfeeding is unique in its impact on the mother and the baby, their bonding and future health implications impacting the society. Breastmilk is produced specific for the infant by the biological mother. It changes in composition with lactation stage, and leads to optimal growth of the baby including establishing circadian rhythms, getting protective antibodies and establishing a healthy gut microbiome. Multiple hormones influence the composition of the milk. Lactation is maintained by removal of the milk. Blood-milk barrier allows for the specific composition of milk by transporting different sized molecules through different mechanisms. It is safe to assume that most medications will be found in some amount in human milk, however, the impact of that is usually not enough to justify stopping breastfeeding. When mothers milk is not available, formula or donor milk can be considered. There are resources to guide the use of medications during lactation that the providers should be aware of and use, to guide medication and breastfeeding recommendations.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Manisha","journal":"Adv Chronic Kidney Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd4ccbdac4837e90209823ff38dbb82e58c51c3f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1548559520300719?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1548559520300719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Breastmilk"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific composition of milk","mothers milk","donor milk","human milk","Blood-milk barrier","multiple medications","use of medications","baby","lactation stage","impact","breastfeeding recommendations","Abstract Pregnancy","different mechanisms","Multiple hormones","biological mother","high risk pregnancy","different sized molecules","low birth weight infant","preterm delivery","condition fraught","challenges","chronic kidney disease","fetal compromise","protective antibodies","bonding","formula","future health implications","circadian rhythms","optimal growth","providers","healthy gut microbiome","society","Breastmilk","resources","removal"],"language":"en"},

Here, complex networks models, like Erd\u00F6s\u2013R\u00E9nyi, Small-World, Scale-Free and Bar\u00E1basi\u2013Albert will be used for modeling a population, since they are used for social networks; and the disease will be modeled by a SIR (Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Recovered) model. The objective of this work is, regardless of the network/population model, analyze which topological parameters are more relevant for a disease success or failure. Therefore, the SIR model is simulated in a wide range of each network model and a first analysis is done. By using data from all simulations, an investigation with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is done in order to find the most relevant topological and disease parameters.","publish_time":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schimit, P.H.T.; Pereira, F.

In particular, RNA viruses deserve special concern given their documented impact on conservation biology, veterinary medicine and public health, with an unprecedented ability to promote an evolutionary host\u2013pathogen arms race from the ultimate infection and immunity perspective. However, besides the requisite molecular/gross anatomical and physiological bases for infectious diseases to transmit from one host to another, both viral pathogens and their reservoirs/vectors exploit a complex anthropological, cultural, historical, psychological and social suite that specifically defines the phylodynamics within Homo sapiens, unlike any other species. Some of these variables include the ecological benefits of living in groups, decisions on hunting and foraging behaviours and dietary preferences, myths and religious doctrines, health economics, travel destinations, population planning, political decisions on agricultural product bans and many others, in a homo-sociome memetic complex. Taken to an extreme, such complexities elucidate the underpinnings of explanations as to why certain viral zoonoses reside in neglected people, places and things, whereas others are chosen selectively and prioritized for active mitigation. Canine-transmitted rabies serves as one prime example of how a neglected viral zoonosis may transition to greater attention on the basis of renewed advocacy, social media, local champions and vested international community engagement. In contrast, certain bat-associated and arboviral diseases suffer from basic ignorance and perpetuated misunderstanding of fundamental reservoir and vector ecology tenets, translated into failed control policies that only exacerbate the underlying environmental conditions of concern. Beyond applied biomedical knowledge, epidemiological skills and biotechnical abilities alone, if a homo-sociome memetic complex approach is also entertained in a modern transdisciplinary context, neglected viral zoonosis may be better understood, controlled, prevented and possibly eliminated, in a more holistic One Health context.","publish_time":"2015-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rupprecht, C.

Previous multiplex PCR assays took hours to days from order time to result. We analyze the clinical impact of switching to a molecular assay with a 3-h test-turnaround-time (TAT). We performed a retrospective review of adult patients who presented to our emergency departments with respiratory symptoms and had a respiratory viral panel (xTAG RVP; RVP) or respiratory pathogen panel (ePlex RP; RPP) within 48 h of presentation. The average TATs for the RVP and RPP were 27.9 and 3.0 h, respectively (P \u003C 0.0001). In RVP-positive and RPP-positive patients, 68.9 and 44.5% of those with normal chest imaging received antibiotics (P = 0.013), while 95.4 and 89.6% of those with abnormal imaging received antibiotics, respectively (P = 0.187). There was no difference in antibiotic duration in RVP-positive and RPP-positive patients with abnormal chest imaging (6.2 and 6.0 days, respectively; P = 0.923) and normal chest imaging (4.5 and 4.3 days, respectively; P = 0.922). Fewer patients were admitted in the RPP-positive compared to the RVP-positive group (76.9 and 88.6%, respectively; P = 0.013), while the proportion of admissions were similar among RPP-negative and RVP-negative patients (85.3 and 87.1%, P = 0.726). Switching to a multiplex respiratory panel with a clinically actionable TAT is associated with reduced hospital admissions and, in admitted adults without focal radiographic findings, reduced antibiotic initiation. Opportunities to further mitigate inappropriate antibiotic use may be realized by combining rapid multiplex PCR with provider education, clinical decision-care algorithms, and active antibiotic stewardship.","publish_time":"2019-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weiss, Zoe F.; Cunha, Cheston B.; Chambers, Alison B.; Carr, Audrey V.; Rochat, Cleo; Raglow-Defranco, Mariska; Parente, Diane M.; Angus, Aimee; Mermel, Leonard A.; Sivaprasad, Latha; Chapin, Kimberle","journal":"J Clin Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86fe86ce31570f771ef1b5f8f8c92a97a9fe22c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6760939.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00861-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVP","TAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RPP-positive patients","RVP-negative patients","RVP-positive group","multiplex respiratory panel","xTAG RVP","RPP-negative","Fewer patients","respiratory symptoms","respiratory viral panel","respiratory pathogen panel","days","abnormal chest imaging","abnormal imaging","rapid multiplex PCR","utility of rapid multiplex molecular respiratory panels","antibiotic duration","retrospective review of adult patients","antibiotic initiation","Previous multiplex PCR assays","active antibiotic stewardship","inappropriate antibiotic use","antibiotics","h of presentation","reduced hospital admissions","h test-turnaround","molecular assay","actionable TAT","admitted adults","clinical impact","proportion of admissions","order time","clinical decision-care algorithms","provider education","hours","focal radiographic findings","ePlex RP","emergency departments","Opportunities","studies","difference","average TATs"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to compare this bacteriological examination with a serological method (ELISA) developed in our laboratory. This ELISA was first evaluated by use of artificially infected hens. During these experimental infection studies, several groups of hens were inoculated with SE, ST, different vaccines and different Salmonella serovars to calculate the experimental parameters of our ELISA. Then, in a field study, 43 flocks were followed monthly using two bacteriological samples (environmental swab and pool of faeces) and 20 serological samples (sera or yolks). Twenty-seven flocks without SE or ST gave a negative serological response throughout their surveillance. Among the 10 various serovars different from SE and ST isolated in this study, S. Heidelberg, S. Agona and S. Hadar gave seropositive results in seven flocks. Consequently, this ELISA was not specific of SE and ST as it detected serovars sharing or not common antigens with SE and ST. Seropositive results were also obtained each month for two flocks where no Salmonella could be isolated. Finally, in seven flocks found infected with SE or ST, the positive ELISA results appeared later than the bacteriological detection. Therefore, for the detection of chicken flocks recently infected with SE or ST, bacteriological examination currently used in France seems to be more appropriate than this ELISA.","publish_time":"2005-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jouy, E.; Proux, K.; Humbert, F.; Rose, V.; Lalande, F.; Houdayer, C.; Picault, J.-P.; Salvat, G.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/315b5e2aa4c317b1b71111c76ac04a48c33cae95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132513.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587705001704; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587705001704","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella Typhimurium","S.

Here we combine virus genomes and reconstructed poultry transportation data to measure and compare the spatial spread in China of three key subtypes of AIV: H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6. Although it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of confounding factors, such as bird migration and spatial distance, we find evidence that the dissemination of these subtypes among domestic poultry is geographically continuous and likely associated with the intensity of the live poultry trade in China. Using two independent data sources and network analysis methods, we report a regional-scale community structure in China that might explain the spread of AIV subtypes in the country. The identification of this structure has the potential to inform more targeted strategies for the prevention and control of AIV in China.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Qiqi; Zhao, Xiang; Lemey, Philippe; Suchard, Marc A.; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Weifeng; Liu, Di; Qi, Wenbao; Zhang, Guogang; Stenseth, Nils Chr.; Pybus, Oliver G.; Tian, Huaiyu","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f0bbda51be06c5872606d245c145bfffb3971e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7084072.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1906954117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123088/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["China","live poultry trade","domestic poultry","spread of AIV subtypes","key subtypes of AIV","reconstructed poultry transportation data","control of AIV","spatial spread","complex poultry production systems","spatial distance","important role","independent data sources","regional-scale community structure","pathogenic avian influenza","viruses","maintenance","network analysis methods","HP AIVs","bird migration","countries","virus genomes","H5N1","large geographic areas","prevention","contribution of confounding factors","targeted strategies","potential","abundance of small-scale observational studies","evidence","H7N9","dissemination","intensity","Asia","country","H5N6","identification"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Study 1 randomly assigned healthy adults to 0.5% carbomer 980 gel (n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) administered intranasally four times daily for 7 days. Nasal examinations were conducted at baseline and daily throughout the study. The primary endpoint was local nasal tolerability. Study 2 randomly assigned adults with an investigator-confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic common cold to 0.5% carbomer 980 gel (n = 87) or placebo (n = 81), administered intranasally four times daily for 7 days (except for day 1, where subjects who received their first dose mid-day administered only three doses). The primary efficacy endpoint was the average nasal symptom score over days 1\u20124 (ANSS(1\u20134)). Secondary efficacy endpoints included ANSS over days 1\u20127 and average total symptom score (ATSS). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: In study 1, subjects assigned to 0.5% carbomer 980 gel had no mucosal grading higher than grade 1B (superficial nasal mucosal erosion) and low incidences of mucosal bleeding and crusting. In study 2, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments for any efficacy endpoints. Active treatment was well-tolerated; the most commonly reported AEs were headache, myalgia, and cough. CONCLUSION: While 0.5% carbomer 980 gel nasal spray demonstrated good local nasal tolerability in healthy volunteers, the spray did not significantly impact the course of infection or resolution of cold symptoms in subjects with common cold.","publish_time":"2019-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dennie, Lara","journal":"Drugs R D","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3676f045c4be859fc72209ad9c657a69b40b9176.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6544708.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004286/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40268-019-0270-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Study","carbomer","gel nasal spray","Nasal examinations","days","good local nasal tolerability","average nasal symptom score","superficial nasal mucosal erosion","common cold symptoms","healthy adults","subjects","primary efficacy endpoint","healthy volunteers","resolution of cold symptoms","Secondary efficacy endpoints","diagnosis of symptomatic common cold","primary endpoint","ANSS","placebo","times","average total symptom score","mucosal grading higher","low incidences of mucosal bleeding","reported AEs","dose mid-day","grade","safety","headache","myalgia","crusting","treatments","course of infection","ATSS","investigator","significant differences","studies of intranasal","Active treatment","doses","baseline","cough","BACKGROUND","Adverse events","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The long-term trend of surface PM concentration in the SMA declined in the 2000s, but since 2012 its concentrations have tended to incline, which is coincident with frequent severe hazes in South Korea. This increase puts the Korean government\u2019s emission reduction efforts in jeopardy. This study reports that interannual variation of surface PM concentration in South Korea is closely linked with the interannual variations of wind speed. A 12-year (2004\u20132015) regional air quality simulation was conducted over East Asia (27-km) and over South Korea (9-km) to assess the impact of meteorology under constant anthropogenic emissions. Simulated PM concentrations show a strong negative correlation (i.e. R = \u22120.86) with regional wind speed, implying that reduced regional ventilation is likely associated with more stagnant conditions that cause severe pollutant episodes in South Korea. We conclude that the current PM concentration trend in South Korea is a combination of long-term decline by emission control efforts and short-term fluctuation of regional wind speed interannual variability.

This study examined the disease exposure of domestic carnivores living near a protected area in Bolivia. Forty dogs and 14 cats living in three towns on the eastern border of Madidi National Park were sampled. High levels of exposure to canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, Sarcoptes scabiei and Toxoplasma gondii were found among domestic dogs, with similarly high levels of exposure to feline parvovirus, feline calicivirus and T. gondii being found among domestic cats. If contact occurs between domestic and wild carnivores, disease spillover may represent an important risk for the persistence of wild carnivores in the region.

Its genome has three open reading frames (ORFs)\u2014called as ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. ORF1 encodes nonstructural polyprotein having multiple domains, namely: Methyltransferase, Y domain, Protease, Macro domain, Helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In the present study, we show that HEV-macro domain specifically interacts with light chain subunit of human ferritin (FTL). In cultured hepatoma cells, HEV-macro domain reduces secretion of ferritin without causing any change in the expression levels of FTL. This inhibitory effect was further enhanced upon Brefeldin-A treatment. The levels of transferrin Receptor 1 or ferroportin, two important proteins in iron metabolism, remained unchanged in HEV-macro domain expressing cells. Similarly, there were no alterations in the levels of cellular labile iron pool and reactive oxygen species, indicating that HEV-macro domain does not influence cellular iron homeostasis/metabolism. As ferritin is an acute-phase protein, secreted in higher level in infected persons and HEV-macro domain has the property of reducing synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, we propose that by directly binding to FTL, macro domain prevents ferritin from entering into circulation and helps in further attenuation of the host immune response.

The effects of landscape heterogeneity on parasite communities are poorly understood, although it has been shown that anthropogenic impacts may contribute to outbreaks of both parasites and pathogens. We tested for effects of landcover type, composition, configuration, and urbanisation on avian diversity and avian malaria prevalence in 26 communities of wetland-associated passerines in the Western Cape of South Africa. We predicted that avian malaria prevalence would be influenced by the pattern of farmland and urban areas in the surrounding landscapes and the sizes of the wetlands in which birds were sampled. We quantified landscape pattern using a six-class simplification of the National Landcover data set at 35 \u00D7 35 m resolution and five extents of between 1 and 20 km from each wetland. The bird community was sampled using point counts and we collected blood samples from birds at each site. We screened these for malaria using PCR and molecular techniques. Passerine species richness and infection prevalence varied significantly between different landcover types. Host richness and parasite prevalence were highest in viticultural and cropping sites respectively and lowest in urban sites. Wetlands located in indigenous vegetation had intermediate numbers of bird species and intermediate parasite prevalence. Landscape composition and habitat type surrounding wetlands emerged as useful correlates of infection prevalence. Anthropogenic landscape modification appears to have both direct and indirect effects on avian communities and their associated parasite assemblages, with attendant consequences for avian health.","publish_time":"2013-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okanga, Sharon; Cumming, Graeme S.; Hockey, Phillip A.

Effective vaccination strategies are needed. We report the development of a novel TB vaccine using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a viral vector system to express Ag85A. VSVAg85A was shown to be immunogenic when given to mice by either an intranasal or an intramuscular (IM) route. Although distinct T-cell profiles resulted from both routes of immunization, only intranasal delivery generated a mucosal T-cell response that was protective upon pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) challenge. While this protection manifested at an early time-point after immunization, it was not sustained. The potential of VSVAg85A to be used as a mucosal booster for parenteral priming by an adenoviral TB vaccine expressing Ag85A (AdAg85A) was investigated. VSVAg85A immunization markedly boosted antigen-specific T-cell responses in the airway lumen while also augmenting immune activation in the systemic compartment, after AdAg85A priming. This translated into significantly better protective efficacy against pulmonary challenge with M.tb than either vaccine used alone. Our study therefore suggests that VSV as a vector system is a promising candidate to be used in a heterologous viral prime-boost immunization regimen against intracellular bacterial infection.","publish_time":"2016-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roediger, Elizabeth K; Kugathasan, Kapilan; Zhang, XiZhong; Lichty, Brian D; Xing, Zhou","journal":"Mol Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b897789885d7e354ff7991528d15340bad90ff57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185538.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616317439; https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2008.59; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616317439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18388911/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VSVAg85A immunization","adenoviral TB vaccine","novel TB vaccine","routes of immunization","Pulmonary tuberculosis","pulmonary challenge","mucosal T-cell response","distinct T-cell profiles","viral vector system","pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis","AdAg85A priming","potential of VSVAg85A","boosted antigen-specific T-cell responses","heterologous viral prime-boost immunization regimen","parenteral priming","intranasal delivery","mucosal booster","better protective efficacy","vesicular stomatitis virus","airway lumen","intracellular bacterial infection","immune activation","systemic compartment","promising candidate","serious health problem","early time","development","Effective vaccination strategies","protection","mice","study"],"language":"en"},

This review focuses on several aspects of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) including epidemiology, diagnosis and management. COPD poses a major health and economic burden in the Asia\u2010Pacific region, as it does worldwide. Triggering factors of AECOPD include infectious (bacteria and viruses) and environmental (air pollution and meteorological effect) factors. Disruption in the dynamic balance between the \u2018pathogens\u2019 (viral and bacterial) and the normal bacterial communities that constitute the lung microbiome likely contributes to the risk of exacerbations. The diagnostic approach to AECOPD varies based on the clinical setting and severity of the exacerbation. After history and examination, a number of investigations may be useful, including oximetry, sputum culture, chest X\u2010ray and blood tests for inflammatory markers. Arterial blood gases should be considered in severe exacerbations, to characterize respiratory failure. Depending on the severity, the acute management of AECOPD involves use of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, oxygen and noninvasive ventilation. Hospitalization may be required, for severe exacerbations. Nonpharmacological interventions including disease\u2010specific self\u2010management, pulmonary rehabilitation, early medical follow\u2010up, home visits by respiratory health workers, integrated programmes and telehealth\u2010assisted hospital at home have been studied during hospitalization and shortly after discharge in patients who have had a recent AECOPD. Pharmacological approaches to reducing risk of future exacerbations include long\u2010acting bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, mucolytics, vaccinations and long\u2010term macrolides.

The traditional view of these RNA elements are as local structures present in non-coding regions. However, this view is changing due to the discovery of regulatory elements in coding regions and functional long-range intra-genomic base pairing interactions. The \u223C4.8 kb long RNA genome of the tombusvirus tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) contains these types of structural features, including six different functional long-distance interactions. We hypothesized that to achieve these multiple interactions this viral genome must utilize a large-scale organizational strategy and, accordingly, we sought to assess the global conformation of the entire TBSV genome. Atomic force micrographs of the genome indicated a mostly condensed structure composed of interconnected protrusions extending from a central hub. This configuration was consistent with the genomic secondary structure model generated using high-throughput selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (i.e. SHAPE), which predicted different sized RNA domains originating from a central region. Known RNA elements were identified in both domain and inter-domain regions, and novel structural features were predicted and functionally confirmed. Interestingly, only two of the six long-range interactions known to form were present in the structural model. However, for those interactions that did not form, complementary partner sequences were positioned relatively close to each other in the structure, suggesting that the secondary structure level of viral genome structure could provide a basic scaffold for the formation of different long-range interactions. The higher-order structural model for the TBSV RNA genome provides a snapshot of the complex framework that allows multiple functional components to operate in concert within a confined context.","publish_time":"2013-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Baodong; Grigull, J\u00F6rg; Ore, Moriam O.; Morin, Sylvie; White, K.

The disease spectrum of EV-D68 infections in children with underlying medical conditions other than asthma, the role of EV-D68 loads on clinical illness, and the variation of EV-D68 strains within the same institution over time have not been described. We sought to define the association between EV-D68 loads and sequence variation, and the clinical characteristic in hospitalized children at our institution from 2011 to 2014. METHODS: May through November 2014, and August to September 2011 to 2013, a convenience sample of nasopharyngeal specimens from children with rhinovirus (RV)/EV respiratory infections were tested for EV-D68 by RT-PCR. Clinical data were compared between children with RV/EV-non-EV-D68 and EV-D68 infections, and among children with EV-D68 infections categorized as healthy, asthmatics, and chronic medical conditions. EV-D68 loads were analyzed in relation to disease severity parameters and sequence variability characterized over time. RESULTS: In 2014, 44% (192/438) of samples tested positive for EV-D68 vs. 10% (13/130) in 2011\u201313 (p\u003C0.0001). PICU admissions (p\u003C0.0001) and non-invasive ventilation (p\u003C0.0001) were more common in children with EV-D68 vs. RV/EV-non-EV-D68 infections. Asthmatic EV-D68\u002B children, required supplemental oxygen administration (p = 0.03) and PICU admissions (p \u003C0.001) more frequently than healthy children or those with chronic medical conditions; however oxygen duration (p\u003C0.0001), and both PICU and total hospital stay (p\u003C0.01) were greater in children with underlying medical conditions, irrespective of viral burden. By phylogenetic analysis, the 2014 EV-D68 strains clustered into a new sublineage within clade B. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest pediatric cohorts described from the EV-D68 outbreak. Irrespective of viral loads, EV-D68 was associated with high morbidity in children with asthma and co-morbidities.

Recent evidence has raised doubts about the efficacy of this treatment in preschool-aged children with viral-induced wheezing and in smoking adults. The aims of the study were to: (1) document the magnitude of response to oral corticosteroids in children presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe asthma; (2) quantify potential determinants of response to corticosteroids and (3) explore the role of gene polymorphisms associated with the responsiveness to corticosteroids. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The design is a prospective cohort study of 1008 children aged 1\u201317 years meeting a strict definition of asthma and presenting with a clinical score of \u22654 on the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All children will receive standardised severity-specific treatment with prednisone/prednisolone and cointerventions (salbutamol with/without ipratropium bromide). Determinants, namely viral aetiology, environmental tobacco smoke and single nucleotide polymorphism, will be objectively documented. The primary efficacy endpoint is the failure of emergency department (ED) management within 72 h of the ED visit. Secondary endpoints include other measures of asthma severity and time to recovery within 7 days of the index visit. The study has 80% power for detecting a risk difference of 7.5% associated with each determinant from a baseline risk of 21%, at an \u03B1 of 0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from all participating institutions. An impaired response to systemic steroids in certain subgroups will challenge the current standard of practice and call for the immediate search for better approaches. A potential host\u2013environment interaction will broaden our understanding of corticosteroid responsiveness in children.

We aimed to describe clinical and serological characteristics of children with HBoV hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection and to evaluate whether differences occur between HBoV alone and in co-infection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 60 children (median age of 6.2 months, range 0.6\u201370.9) hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms, with HBoV detected from a respiratory sample, using a reverse transcriptase-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL-63 and HUK1, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus1\u20133, and human metapneumovirus). RESULTS: HBoV was detected alone in 29 (48.3%) patients, while in co-infection with other viruses in 31 patients (51.7%), with a peak between December and January. Among the 60 patients, 34 were bronchiolitis, 19 wheezing, 3 pneumonia, 2 upper respiratory tract infection, and 2 whooping cough. Seven children (11.6%) required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory failure. No differences was observed in age, family history for atopy and/or asthma, clinical presentations, chest X-ray, or laboratory findings in children with HBoV alone vs. multiple viral detection. RSV was the most frequently co-detected virus (61.3%). When compared with HBoV detection alone, the co-detection of RSV and HBoV was associated with male sex (P = 0.013), younger age (P = 0.01), and lower blood neutrophil count (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: HBoV can be detected alone and in co-infection respiratory samples of children with an acute respiratory tract infection. A cause\u2013effect relationship between HBoV and respiratory infection is not clear, so further studies are needed to clarify this point.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrarca, Laura; Nenna, Raffaella; Frassanito, Antonella; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Di Mattia, Greta; Scagnolari, Carolina; Midulla, Fabio","journal":"World J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94c8dd71f8f51cce1a45aa3763a5b4b0e5c6cdec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091143.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-019-00324-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31776891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infection","respiratory viruses","HBoV detection","respiratory failure","acute respiratory tract infection","respiratory pathogen","co-infection respiratory samples of children","upper respiratory tract infection","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory symptoms","co-detected virus","co-detection of RSV","patients","serological characteristics of children","median age","human metapneumovirus","younger age","differences","human coronavirus OC43","role of human bocavirus","multiple viral detection","clinical presentations","chest X-ray","asthma","PICU","pneumonia","paediatric intensive care unit","laboratory findings","adenovirus","HUK1","NL","parainfluenza virus1","admission","atopy","reverse transcriptase-PCR","effect relationship","reviewed data","lower blood neutrophil count","rhinovirus","family history","male sex","whooping cough","wheezing","bronchiolitis","BACKGROUND","cause","months","studies","METHODS","point","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","peak"],"language":"en"},

In this survey, we examine the RNA targets, design and discovery strategies, and chemical probe characterization techniques of these ligands. We discuss the applicability of current tools to identify and evaluate RNA-targeted chemical probes, suggest criteria to assess the quality of RNA chemical probes and targets, and propose areas where new tools are particularly needed.

While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Objective To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years. Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%). Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients). At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults. Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children. These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shekerdemian, Lara S; Mahmood, Nabihah R; Wolfe, Katie K; Riggs, Becky J; Ross, Catherine E; McKiernan, Christine A; Heidemann, Sabrina M; Kleinman, Lawrence C; Sen, Anita I; Hall, Mark W; Priestley, Margaret A; McGuire, John K; Boukas, Konstantinos; Sharron, Matthew P; Burns, Jeffrey P","journal":"JAMA pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["burden of COVID","infection","patients","characterization of COVID","confirmed COVID","hospitalized children","hospital outcomes of children","children positive","North American PICUs","extensive studies of children","early outcomes","Prehospital comorbidities","clinical trajectory","early report","early description","Main Outcomes","presence of comorbidities","range","significant preexisting comorbidities","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","median","adults","days","severity of disease","important platform","hospital lengths","important factor","used agent","follow-up period","ongoing coronavirus disease","Measures Prehospital characteristics","Participants","therapeutic interventions","cross-sectional study","mode of presentation","severe illness","pediatric intensive care units","unprecedented toll","date","Setting","Importance","Relevance","preliminary observations","adult counterparts","ventilatory support","limited reports","Conclusions","failure","pandemic","organ systems","Design","hydroxychloroquine","completion","Objective","male","Targeted therapies","evidence","combination","Results","respiratory symptoms","invasive ventilation","years"],"language":"en"},

The model builds on the recognition that public health is everybody\u0027s business and therefore, needs a common definitional base. Different levels of skill and a wide range of contributions are needed if public health programmes are to make the most impact. The different domains of practice help to construct a basis for understanding the necessary elements of the public health system and their interactions. Using teenage pregnancy as a case study of a public health programme highlights the characteristics of the model. It demonstrates not only the importance of the role of directors of public health in taking a population-based overview, but also the need for multisectoral, multidisciplinary working.

While there is no antiviral therapy available against this potentially lethal disease, the efficacy of the only approved vaccine is not optimal and its safety has been recently questioned. In order to develop better vaccines based on attenuated and/or chimeric viruses, one must consider how the human immune system is engaged during DENV infection. The activation of the innate immunity through the detection of viruses by cellular sensors is the first line of defence against those pathogens. This triggers a cascade of events which establishes an antiviral state at the cell level and leads to a global immunological response. However, DENV has evolved to interfere with the innate immune signalling at multiple levels, hence dampening antiviral responses and favouring viral replication and dissemination. This review elaborates on the interplay between DENV and the innate immune system. A special focus is given on the viral countermeasure mechanisms reported over the last decade which should be taken into consideration during vaccine development.","publish_time":"2019-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tremblay, Nicolas; Freppel, Wesley; Sow, A\u00EFssatou A\u00EFcha; Chatel-Chaix, Laurent","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac8b5e9b4a49a1062eddf4fc48a19778e66e9a78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6963221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658677/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7040145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immune system","DENV infection","innate immune signalling","antiviral responses","antiviral state","innate immunity","human immune system","antiviral therapy available","viral replication","detection of viruses","approved vaccine","chimeric viruses","vaccine development","viral countermeasure mechanisms","infections","multiple levels","risk","dengue virus","lethal disease","cellular sensors","cell level","serious threat","efficacy","interplay","line of defence","world population","better vaccines","decade","global immunological response","public health","consideration","dissemination","special focus","cascade of events","order","pathogens","safety","activation","review"],"language":"en"},

It is unclear whether pregnant women manifest enhanced disease similar to influenza viral infection or whether specific risk factors might predispose to severe disease. Objective To describe maternal disease and obstetrical outcomes associated with Covid-19 disease in pregnancy to rapidly inform clinical care. Study Design Retrospective study of pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from six hospital systems in Washington State between January 21, 2020 and April 17, 2020. Demographics, medical and obstetric history, and Covid-19 encounter data were abstracted from medical records. Results A total of 46 pregnant patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified from hospital systems capturing 40% of births in Washington State. Nearly all pregnant individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection were symptomatic (93.5%, n=43) and the majority were in their second or third trimester (43.5%, n=20 and 50.0%, n=23, respectively). Symptoms resolved in a median of 24 days (interquartile range 13-37). Seven women were hospitalized (16%) including one admitted to the intensive care unit. Six cases (15%) were categorized as severe Covid-19 disease with nearly all patients being either overweight or obese prior to pregnancy, asthma or other co-morbidities. Eight deliveries occurred during the study period, including a preterm birth at 33 weeks to improve pulmonary status in a woman with Class III obesity. One stillbirth occurred of unknown etiology. Conclusions Nearly 15% of pregnant patients developed severe Covid-19, which occurred primarily in overweight or obese women with underlying conditions. Obesity and Covid-19 may synergistically increase risk for a medically-indicated preterm birth to improve maternal pulmonary status in late pregnancy. Collectively, these findings support categorizing pregnant patients as a higher risk group, particularly for those with chronic co-morbidities.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lokken, Erica M.; Walker, Christie L.; Delaney, Shani; Kachikis, Alisa; Kretzer, Nicole M.; Erickson, Anne; Resnick, Rebecca; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Hwang, Joseph K.; Barnhart, Nena; Rah, Jasmine; Mccartney, Stephen A.; Ma, Kimberly K.; Huebner, Emily M.; Thomas, Chad; Sheng, Jessica S.; Paek, Bettina W.; Retzlaff, Kristin; Kline, Carolyn R.; Munson, Jeff; Blain, Michela; Lacourse, Sylvia M.; Deutsch, Gail; Adams Waldorf, Kristina","journal":"American journal of obstetrics and gynecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ad11c8de3536bfb54f1201d5829fe78700bd72d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820305585; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305585?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439389/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Washington State"],"keyphrases":["severe disease","maternal disease","severe Covid","coronavirus disease","categorizing pregnant patients","mild disease","pregnant individuals","pregnant women manifest enhanced disease similar","Study Design Retrospective study of pregnant patients","SARS-CoV","obese women","maternal pulmonary status","influenza viral infection","study period","maternal death","preterm birth","late pregnancy","hospital systems","Washington State","obesity","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","specific risk factors","higher risk group","chronic co-morbidities","encounter data","early data","medical records","clinical care","intensive care unit","laboratory","variable course of illness","case series","asthma","obstetrical outcomes","obstetric history","median","woman","Class","impact","underlying conditions","births","weeks","Abstract Background","days","interquartile range","Demographics","Objective","findings","stillbirth","unknown etiology","deliveries","total","Conclusions","Symptoms","majority","trimester","cases"],"language":"en"},

Thus, probiotics and the modulation of the intestinal microbiota are envisaged as therapeutic strategies in the prevention and treatment of viral infection.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monedero, Vicente; Rodr\u00EDguez-D\u00EDaz, Jes\u00FAs","journal":"Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6774ccc4c8730e2f8bc03e04ac48f313af55d6eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150029.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021897000629; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128021897000629","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intestinal microbiota","intestinal viral susceptibility","intestinal commensal bacteria","treatment of viral infection","viral infection capacity","use of probiotics","scientific studies","critical factor","prevention","therapeutic strategies","viruses","interaction of virus","pathogenesis","antiviral therapies","contact","modulation","Abstract","mucosal sites"],"language":"en"},

Recent years have seen considerable progress in the development of methodologies for reconstructing transmission chains using both epidemiological and genetic data. However, only a few of these methods have been implemented in software packages, and with little consideration for customisability and interoperability. Users are therefore limited to a small number of alternatives, incompatible tools with fixed functionality, or forced to develop their own algorithms at considerable personal effort. RESULTS: Here we present outbreaker2, a flexible framework for outbreak reconstruction. This R package re-implements and extends the original model introduced with outbreaker, but most importantly also provides a modular platform allowing users to specify custom models within an optimised inferential framework. As a proof of concept, we implement the within-host evolutionary model introduced with TransPhylo, which is very distinct from the original genetic model in outbreaker, and demonstrate how even complex model results can be successfully included with minimal effort. CONCLUSIONS: outbreaker2 provides a valuable starting point for future outbreak reconstruction tools, and represents a unifying platform that promotes customisability and interoperability. Implemented in the R software, outbreaker2 joins a growing body of tools for outbreak analysis.","publish_time":"2018-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campbell, Finlay; Didelot, Xavier; Fitzjohn, Rich; Ferguson, Neil; Cori, Anne; Jombart, Thibaut","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a3c6a9ff71461bd81862fc711d5605cfbbb975d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6196407.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2330-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343663/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["original model","original genetic model","future outbreak reconstruction tools","outbreak analysis","complex model results","incompatible tools","infectious disease outbreak","present outbreaker2","R software","host evolutionary model","customisability","interoperability","Users","growing body of tools","reconstructing transmission chains","considerable personal effort","valuable information","flexible framework","considerable progress","unifying platform","software packages","genetic data","modular platform","minimal effort","valuable starting point","individual transmission events","optimised inferential framework","R package re-implements","custom models","help","development of methodologies","small number of alternatives","little consideration","infection control policy","fixed functionality","TransPhylo","Recent years","BACKGROUND","algorithms","CONCLUSIONS","methods","proof of concept"],"language":"en"},

Some general coronavirus characteristics were apparent (e.g. high U, low C count), but we also detected species-specific signatures. Most strikingly, the high U and low C proportions are quite variable and act like communicating vessels, C goes down when U goes up and vice versa. U ranges among virus isolates from 30.7% to 40.3%, and C makes the opposite movement from 20.0% to 12.9%, respectively. The nucleotide biases are more pronounced in the unpaired regions of the structured RNA genome, which may suggest a certain biological function for these distinctive sequence signatures. Coronaviruses have an atypical codon usage that has been linked to mutational events operating on the viral RNA genome on an evolutionary time scale. We suggest that the atypical nucleotide bias may serve a distinct biological function and that it is the direct cause of the characteristic codon usage in these viruses.

The new virus was later named SARS-CoV-2. The virus has affected tens of thousands of patients in the world. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 causes severe pneumonia and even death. It is urgently needed to find a therapeutic method to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies showed that the surface spike (S) protein is essential for the coronavirus binding and entry of host cells. The heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) in the S protein play a decisive role in the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. We predicted the HR1 and HR2 regions in S protein by sequence alignment. We simulated a computational model of HR1/2 regions and the fusion core. The binding energy of HR1 and HR2 of the fusion core was -33.4kCal/mol. We then designed antivirus peptides by molecular dynamics simulation of the fusion core. The binding energy of HR2-based antiviral peptide to HR1 was -43.0kCal/mol, which was stronger than the natural stage of the fusion core, suggesting that the predicted antiviral peptide can competitively bind with HR1 to prevent forming of the fusion core. The antiviral peptides can prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion and can potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ling, Rongsong; Dai, Yarong; Huang, Boxuan; Huang, Wenjie; Lu, Xifeng; Jiang, Yizhou","journal":"Peptides","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9452faadfcda837a6c7743b049546c36da82f2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198429.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196978120300772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380200/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2020.170328; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978120300772?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["fusion core","membrane fusion","SARS-CoV","binding energy of HR1","S protein","HR2 regions","binding energy of HR2","infection of SARS","computational model of HR1","coronavirus binding","antiviral peptides","predicted antiviral peptide","viral membrane","host cell membrane","patients","kCal","novel coronavirus","antivirus peptides","new virus","entry of host cells","molecular dynamics simulation","Wuhan City","surface spike","sequence alignment","decisive role","Hubei Province","China","natural stage","tens of thousands","severe pneumonia","nCoV","therapeutic method","forming","prevention","treatment of infections","death","Studies","outbreak","world","heptad repeats"],"language":"en"},

In total, 44, 39, 41, 48, and 38 proteins were identified in the tracheal tissues of the chickens inoculated with IBV (ck/CH/LDL/97I, H120), NDV (La Sota), and AIV H9, and between ck/CH/LDL/97I and H120, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis showed that IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 induced similar core host responses involved in biosynthetic, catabolic, metabolic, signal transduction, transport, cytoskeleton organization, macromolecular complex assembly, cell death, response to stress, and immune system process. Comparative analysis of host response induced by different viruses indicated differences in protein expression changes induced by IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 may be responsible for the specific pathogenesis of these different viruses. Our result reveals specific host response to IBV, NDV, and AIVH9 infections and provides insights into the distinct pathogenic mechanisms of these avian respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2014-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Junfeng; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Cao, Zhongzan; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3370a85527782792c15d5992619f9f44a34b4ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167649.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201300404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610701/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIV","MALDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV","NDV","AIV H9 infections","different viruses","H9 subtype","avian respiratory viruses","Comparative analysis of host response","specific host response","specific pathogenesis","TOF","comparative proteomic analysis","Bioinformatics analysis","LDL","H120","Newcastle disease virus","avian influenza virus","serious respiratory tract disease","similar core host responses","target organs","molecular pathogenesis","AIVH9 infections","proteome changes of primary target organ","major pathogens of chickens","protein expression changes","cytoskeleton organization","macromolecular complex assembly","transport","signal transduction","cell death","stress","distinct pathogenic mechanisms","differences","heavy economic losses","insights","DIGE","MALDI","Infectious bronchitis coronavirus","result","Sota","immune system process","tracheal tissues","replication features","proteins","total"],"language":"en"},

The governance of nutrition, which is essential to designing and implementing policies to realise the right to food, is among the most important and most defining duties of society. But research and action on nutrition governance are hampered by the absence of conceptual rigour, even as the continuing very high burden of undernutrition and the rapid rise in obesity highlight the need for such structures. The breadth of nutrition itself suggests that governance is both needed and sure to be complicated. This analysis explores the reasons attention has come to governance in development policy making, and why it has focused on nutrition governance in particular. It then assesses how the concept of nutrition governance has been used, finding that it has become increasingly prominent in scholarship on poor nutritional outcomes, but remains weakly specified and is invoked by different authors to mean different things. Undernutrition analysts have stressed coordination problems and structural issues related to the general functioning of government. Those studying obesity have emphasised international trade policies, regulatory issues and corporate behaviour. This paper argues that the lack of a clear, operational definition of governance is a serious obstacle to conceptualising and solving major problems in nutrition. To address this need, it develops a unified definition of nutrition governance consisting of three principles: accountability, participation and responsiveness. These are justified with reference to the social contract that defines modern nations and identifies citizens as the ultimate source of national power and legitimacy. A unified framework is then employed to explore solutions to nutrition governance problems.","publish_time":"2018-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bump, Jesse B","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a098b3876e799d9b21608e26e80d05aa9ec6475.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6195135.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30364379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["governance of nutrition","nutrition governance problems","concept of nutrition governance","unified definition of nutrition governance","breadth of nutrition","operational definition of governance","obesity","need","Undernutrition analysts","high burden of undernutrition","coordination problems","major problems","paper","regulatory issues","structural issues","essential underpinning","global development","different authors","different things","development policy","unified framework","international trade policies","absence of conceptual rigour","world\u2019s disease burden","poor nutritional outcomes","single greatest constraint","rapid rise","analytic clarity","ultimate source of national power","citizens","serious obstacle","principles","modern nations","corporate behaviour","effective approaches","social contract","legitimacy","scholarship","lack","accountability","solutions","reasons attention","general functioning of government","defining duties of society","participation","responsiveness","food","research","action","reference","analysis","right","structures"],"language":"en"},

Descriptive statistics were produced and differences between deans and association presidents were tested by Fisher exact test. Results The questionnaire response rate was 50% (25 returned/50 sent) for the state association presidents and 65% (11/17) for the deans. There were no statistically significant differences between the leadership groups for any survey questions. All agreed that optometrists have the skills, are ethically obligated to help, and that optometrists should receive additional training for participation in disaster response. There was general agreement that optometrists should provide first-aid, obtain medical histories, triage, maintain infection control, manage a point of distribution, prescribe medications, and counsel the \u201Cworried well.\u201D Starting intravenous lines, interpreting radiographs, and suturing were less favorably supported.

Cattle production is one of the most important economic sectors in Uruguay. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of BCoV infections and their genetic diversity in Uruguayan calves and to describe the evolutionary history of the virus in South America. The overall detection rate of BCoV in Uruguay was 7.8% (64/824): 7.7% (60/782) in dairy cattle and 9.5% (4/42) in beef cattle. The detection rate of BCoV in samples from deceased and live calves was 10.0% (6/60) and 7.6% (58/763), respectively. Interestingly, there was a lower frequency of BCoV detection in calves born to vaccinated dams (3.3%, 8/240) than in calves born to unvaccinated dams (12.2%, 32/263) (OR: 4.02, 95%CI: 1.81\u20138.90; p = 0.00026). The frequency of BCoV detection was higher in colder months (11.8%, 44/373) than in warmer months (1.5%, 3/206) (OR: 9.05, 95%CI: 2.77\u201329.53, p = 0.000013). Uruguayan strains grouped together in two different lineages: one with Argentinean strains and the other with Brazilian strains. Both BCoV lineages were estimated to have entered Uruguay in 2013: one of them from Brazil (95%HPD interval: 2011\u20132014) and the other from Argentina (95%HPD interval: 2010\u20132014). The lineages differed by four amino acid changes, and both were divergent from the Mebus reference strain.

Currently, the world is suffering a pandemic caused by a new strain of the coronavirus family called COVID-19. Certain infection control precautions are needed to protect immunocompromised and vulnerable patients, including liver transplant candidates and recipients from acquiring COVID-19 infection. Restricting non-transplant elective surgical procedures, managing transplant patients in separate outpatient clinics, and in-patient wards can prevent transmission of infection both to patients and healthcare workers.

The construction of these hospitals can be considered as the concrete expression of a therapeutic innovation which recognized insanity as an illness that could be treated in such specialised institutions. The spatial diffusion of these innovative institutions through 19th and 20th century France is analysed and we explore how far this can be understood through theories of diffusion of innovations including geographical models of hierarchical and expansion diffusion (or whether other conceptual models are more appropriate). The research reported here particularly focuses on the period 1800\u20131961. It involved the construction of an original historical database of both psychiatric hospitals and information on the cities where these institutions were located. This was used to examine and interpret the different phases of development of psychiatric institutions and the parts of the country and types of geographical setting where they were concentrated. A multiple correspondence analysis was then performed to examine the connections between different aspects of the diffusion process. The study shows the limitations of classical models of spatial diffusion, which are found to be consistent with some, but not all aspects of the development of psychiatric institutions in France. An alternative political ecology approach seems more appropriate to conceptualise the various processes involved; national policies, social representations, medicalisation of care of mental illness, and urban and economic growth all seem to be associated with the emergence of a variable and complex pattern. This paper also opens a large field of research. Compared with other western countries, the geography of French psychiatric care is relatively under-researched, although there has been a strong spatial dimension to mental health policy in the country. This analysis provides a context for studies of more contemporary processes of French deinstitutionalisation, which is strongly structured by the past heritage of these large asylum facilities.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coldefy, Magali; Curtis, Sarah E.","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dacecb408b073b59ccfe0ddd540243a021a7268b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116974.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953610006921; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953610006921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21055855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["development of psychiatric institutions","specialised institutions","specialised psychiatric hospitals","expansion diffusion","theories of diffusion","diffusion process","innovative institutions","limitations of classical models of spatial diffusion","geography of French psychiatric care","century France","mental illness","geographical models of hierarchical","conceptual models","country","different aspects","construction","strong spatial dimension","different phases of development","large field of research","medicalisation of care","contemporary processes of French deinstitutionalisation","various processes","European countries","western countries","mental health policy","types of geographical setting","large asylum facilities","multiple correspondence analysis","national policies","social representations","original historical database","studies","innovations","information","parts","therapeutic innovation","past heritage","alternative political ecology approach","context","cities","concrete expression","economic growth","emergence","variable","complex pattern","insanity","study","connections","paper","period"],"language":"en"},

Identifying novel targets/pathways required for MERS infectivity is therefore important for developing novel therapeutics. As an enveloped virus, translocation through the endolysosomal system provides one pathway for cellular entry of MERS-CoV. In this context, Ca2\u002B-permeable channels within the endolysosomal system regulate both the luminal environment and trafficking events, meriting investigation of their role in regulating processing and trafficking of MERS-CoV. Knockdown of endogenous two-pore channels (TPCs), targets for the Ca2\u002B mobilizing second messenger NAADP, impaired infectivity in a MERS-CoV spike pseudovirus particle translocation assay. This effect was selective as knockdown of the lysosomal cation channel mucolipin-1 (TRPML1) was without effect. Pharmacological inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2\u002B release using several bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids also blocked MERS pseudovirus translocation. Knockdown of TPC1 (biased endosomally) or TPC2 (biased lysosomally) decreased the activity of furin, a protease which facilitates MERS fusion with cellular membranes. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TPC1 activity also inhibited endosomal motility impairing pseudovirus progression through the endolysosomal system. Overall, these data support a selective, spatially autonomous role for TPCs within acidic organelles to support MERS-CoV translocation.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunaratne, Gihan S.; Yang, Yang; Li, Fang; Walseth, Timothy F.; Marchant, Jonathan S.","journal":"Cell Calcium","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61ac93bdaec7585d407c80ad2f33708fac3977d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6251489.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2018.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121440/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143416018301210; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143416018301210","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV translocation","MERS infectivity","trafficking of MERS","MERS pseudovirus translocation","MERS fusion","cellular entry of MERS","MERS-CoV spike pseudovirus particle translocation assay","endolysosomal system","Knockdown of TPC1","TPCs","evoked Ca2","Pharmacological inhibition of NAADP","Knockdown of endogenous","novel targets","effect","genetic inhibition of TPC1 activity","autonomous role","activity of furin","impaired infectivity","trafficking events","pore channels","permeable channels","messenger NAADP","cellular membranes","novel therapeutics","endosomal motility impairing pseudovirus progression","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","luminal environment","bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids","acidic organelles","existing drugs","meriting investigation","lysosomal cation channel mucolipin","significant mortality rate","release","TPC2","protease","infections","processing","TRPML1","pathways","poor efficacy","enveloped virus","context","data"],"language":"en"},

Patients and methods Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. Results A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A\u002BB 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was \u20AC177.00 (N =131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. Conclusion Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type.

HOCl, the active ingredient in bleach, has antibacterial/antiviral properties. As myeloperoxidase is needed for HOCl production, non-myeloid cells are considered incapable of producing HOCl. Here, we show that epithelial, fibroblast and hepatic cells have enhanced antiviral activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl). Replication of enveloped/non-enveloped, DNA (herpes simplex virus-1, murine gammaherpesvirus 68) and RNA (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, human coronavirus 229E, coxsackievirus B3) viruses are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Whilst treatment with sodium channel inhibitors did not prevent NaCl-mediated virus inhibition, a chloride channel inhibitor reversed inhibition by NaCl, suggesting intracellular chloride is required for antiviral activity. Inhibition is also reversed in the presence of 4-aminobenzoic hydrazide, a myeloperoxidase inhibitor, suggesting epithelial cells have a peroxidase to convert Cl(\u2212) to HOCl. A significant increase in intracellular HOCl production is seen early in infection. These data suggest that non-myeloid cells possess an innate antiviral mechanism dependent on the availability of Cl(\u2212) to produce HOCl. Antiviral activity against a broad range of viral infections can be augmented by increasing availability of NaCl.","publish_time":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramalingam, Sandeep; Cai, Baiyi; Wong, Junsheng; Twomey, Matthew; Chen, Rui; Fu, Rebecca M.; Boote, Toby; McCaughan, Hugh; Griffiths, Samantha J.; Haas, J\u00FCrgen G.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce50fd91c0c1bbd6f3f9de6a231a9cd41700108b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6134045.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-31936-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30206371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","intracellular HOCl production","non-myeloid cells","NaCl-mediated virus inhibition","intracellular chloride","epithelial cells","antiviral properties","availability of NaCl","chloride channel inhibitor","hepatic cells","chloride ions","myeloperoxidase inhibitor","innate antiviral mechanism dependent","presence of increasing concentrations of sodium chloride","herpes simplex virus","respiratory syncytial virus","enzyme myeloperoxidase","sodium channel inhibitors","Replication of enveloped","dose-dependent manner","influenza","human coronavirus","RNA","hypochlorous acid","bleach","DNA","coxsackievirus B3","murine gammaherpesvirus","ingested microbes","broad range of viral infections","viruses","phagolysosomes","active ingredient","aminobenzoic hydrazide","significant increase","fibroblast","Phagocytes","treatment","data","hydrogen peroxide"],"language":"en"},

This disease, named as COVID-19, is similar to patients infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and nearly 20% of patients developed severe condition. Cardiac injury is a prevalent complication of severe patients, exacerbating the disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the key host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in multiple organs, but its cellular distribution in human heart is not illuminated clearly. This study performed the first state-of-art single cell atlas of adult human heart, and revealed that pericytes with high expression of ACE2 might act as the target cardiac cell of SARS-CoV-2. The pericytes injury due to virus infection may result in capillary endothelial cells dysfunction, inducing microvascular dysfunction. And patients with basic heart failure disease showed increased ACE2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, meaning that if infected by the virus these patients may have higher risk of heart attack and critically ill condition. The finding of this study explains the high rate of severe cases among COVID-19 patients with basic cardiovascular disease; and these results also perhaps provide important reference to clinical treatment of cardiac injury among severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Liang; Li, Xiangjie; Chen, Mingquan; Feng, Yi; Xiong, Chenglong","journal":"Cardiovasc Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c315ecf3cdd574a4804671e89a187c8e23b7c31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184507.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32227090/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvaa078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["prevalent complication of severe patients","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","coronavirus disease","MERS-CoV","basic heart failure disease","disease severity","COVID","severe condition","target cardiac cell of SARS","basic cardiovascular disease","pericytes injury","high expression of ACE2","increased ACE2 expression","clinical treatment of cardiac injury","key host cellular receptor of SARS","high rate of severe cases","study","higher risk of heart attack","art single cell atlas of adult human heart","cellular distribution","microvascular dysfunction","virus infection","ill condition","capillary endothelial cells dysfunction","important reference","mRNA","results","outbreaks","state","China","protein levels","new type of pneumonia","spreads","multiple organs","countries","Angiotensin","enzyme","finding"],"language":"en"},

High-resolution structures revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, molecular mimicry was a major feature of mAb-GP interactions. Broadly neutralizing mAb rEBOV-520 targeted a conserved epitope on the GP base region. mAb rEBOV-548 bound to a glycan cap epitope, possessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector function activities, and potentiated neutralization by rEBOV-520.

Thus, upon intracellular virus detection, the infected cell must initiate clearance pathways without triggering neuronal cell death.

Early restriction of virus replication is accomplished by the innate immune response upon activation of pattern recognition receptors in resident cells.

This approach can lead to a limited understanding of trust in physicians as trust is based on the relationship, an interaction of both parties: patients and physicians. This study aimed to investigate the factors for trust in physicians among the Koreans by focusing on patients\u2019 traits which are related to their subjective perceptions. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted between August and September 2016 among 1000 Korean adults aged 18 to 59 years. Survey participants were selected by a proportionate quota sampling based on age, sex and place of residence. The t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to examine the difference in trust in physicians among the different groups in each variable of patient characteristics. An ordinal logistic regression model was employed to examine the association between trust in physicians and patient attributes. RESULTS: Negative health-related traits, such as stress and low self-rated health, were likely to lower trust in physicians, and women were less likely to trust physicians. The negative attitudes toward the current health care system were strongly associated with low trust in physicians. Meanwhile, recent experience of hospitalization or outpatient visit was positively associated with trust in physicians, and experience of not being able to use health facilities showed no significant association. These results suggest that trust in physicians is more likely to be lowered by negative perception than by the objective conditions or experience. CONCLUSION: In investigating the factors for trust in physicians, the patients\u2019 predispositions, which make them less likely to trust physicians, should be considered. The attributes of the patients in Korea, which could negatively affect trust in physicians, need to be investigated in consideration of the recent changes in patient-physician relationships and the medical environment in Korea.

The main objective of this article made up of two parts is to present the actual sequencing methodologies and the main evolutions in progress in this field. Individual human sequencing is not so far. In addition to ethical questions that will rise, other questions need to be considered.

Here we show that immunogens based on full-length S DNA and S1 subunit protein elicit robust serum-neutralizing activity against several MERS-CoV strains in mice and non-human primates. Serological analysis and isolation of murine monoclonal antibodies revealed that immunization elicits NAbs to RBD and, non-RBD portions of S1 and S2 subunit. Multiple neutralization mechanisms were demonstrated by solving the atomic structure of a NAb-RBD complex, through sequencing of neutralization escape viruses and by constructing MERS-CoV S variants for serological assays.

Information regarding infection in pregnancy is still limited. Objectives To describe the clinical course of severe and critical infection in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for SARS-CoV2. Study Design This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020. Severe infection was defined according to published criteria by patient reported dyspnea, respiratory rate \u003E 30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation \u2264 93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen \u003C300 and/or lung infiltrates \u003E50% within 24 to 48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded if they had presumed COVID-19 infection but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results Of 64 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, 44 (69%) had severe and 20 (31%) critical disease. The following pre-existing comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease and the mean BMI was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean 29 \u00B16 weeks and at hospital admission a mean of 30 \u00B16 weeks, on a median day of disease 7 since first symptoms. Eighty-one percent of women were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 9% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days for severe, 10.5 days for critical, p=0.01). For those who required it, intubation usually occurred around day 9, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease occurred on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was performed in 20% of cases, the rate of ARDS was 70%, and re-intubation was necessary in 20%. There was one case of maternal cardiac arrest, but no cases of cardiomyopathy and no maternal deaths. Thirty-two (50%) women in this cohort delivered during their COVID-19 hospitalization (34% of severe and 85% of critical women). Eighty-eight percent (15/17) of pregnant women with critical COVID-19 who delivered during their disease course were delivered preterm, 94% of them via cesarean; in all, 75% (15/20) of critically ill women delivered preterm. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths, or cases of vertical transmission. Conclusion In hospitalized pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection, admission typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 severe versus 12 critical). Critically ill women had a high rate of ARDS, and there was one case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy, or maternal mortality. Hospitalization for severe or critical COVID-19 infection resulted in delivery during the course of infection in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester. There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pierce-Williams, Rebecca A.M.; Burd, Julia; Felder, Laura; Khoury, Rasha; Bernstein, Peter S.; Avila, Karina; Penfield, Christina A.; Roman, Ashley S.; DeBolt, Chelsea A.; Stone, Joanne L.; Bianco, Angela; Kern-Goldberger, Adina R.; Hirshberg, Adi; Srinivas, Sindhu K.; Jayakumaran, Jenani S.; Brandt, Justin S.; Anastasio, Hannah; Birsner, Meredith; O\u2019Brien, Devon S.; Sedev, Harish M.; Dolin, Cara D.; Schnettler, William T.; Suhag, Anju; Ahluwalia, Shabani; Navathe, Reshama S.; Khalifeh, Adeeb; Anderson, Kathryn; Berghella, Vincenzo","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ecf5525fb3a72fb0b6907979818156871e1195e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258993332030077X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391519/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100134; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S258993332030077X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Design This","BMI","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["critical women","Critical disease","severe disease","critical infection","critical COVID","Severe infection","ill women","percent of women","hospitalized pregnant women","cardiac disease","disease course","cohort study of pregnant women","median disease day","median day of disease","course of infection","clinical course of severe","days","presumed COVID","cases of cardiomyopathy","hospital admission","respiratory rate","case of cardiac arrest","case of maternal cardiac arrest","duration of hospitalization","maternal deaths","median duration of hospital stay","supplemental oxygen","inspired oxygen","respiratory failure","neonatal outcomes","symptom onset","neonatal deaths","onset of symptoms","blood oxygen saturation","cases of vertical transmission","Secondary outcomes","mean BMI","high rate of ARDS","weeks","maternal mortality","re-intubation","perinatal deaths","partial pressure of arterial oxygen","positive laboratory testing","peak respiratory support","Study Design","timing of delivery","clinical courses","room air","pandemic","patient","dyspnea","published criteria","need","minute","septic shock","SARS-CoV2","primary outcome","therapeutic anticoagulation","world","impact","multiple organ dysfunction","prone positioning","Conclusion","healthcare systems","resultant mortalities","Gestational age","Abstract Background","stillbirths","hydroxychloroquine","remdesivir","pulmonary condition","hours","chest imaging","following pre-existing comorbidities","writing","m2","Treatment","Objectives","Information","pregnancy","US institutions","Results","lung infiltrates","trimester","cesarean"],"language":"en"},

A model-based analysis using a retrospective cohort of all hospitalized children with CSF EV PCR testing done between November 2013 and 2017. The primary outcome measured was the potential date of discharge if the EV PCR result had been available on the same day. Patients with positive EV PCR were considered for potential earlier discharge once clinically stable with no reason for hospitalization other than intravenous antibiotics. Descriptive statistics and cost-sensitivity analyses were performed. CSF EV PCR testing was done on 153 patients, of which 44 (29%) had a positive result. Median test TAT was 5.3 days (IQR 3.9\u20137.6). Median hospital LOS was 5 days (IQR 3\u201312). Most (86%) patients received intravenous antibiotics with mean duration of 5.72 \u00B1 6.51 days. No patients with positive EV PCR had a serious bacterial infection.

This article describes the physical conversion of a standard positive pressure operating theatre into a negative pressure environment, problems encountered, airflow design, and evaluation of performance. Since entering regular service, routine measurements and observations have indicated that the airflow performance has been satisfactory. This has also been confirmed by regular air sampling checks. Computational fluid dynamics, a computer modelling technique, was used to compare the distribution of room air before and after the design changes from positive to negative pressure. The simulation results show that the physical environment and the dispersion pattern of bacteria in the negative pressure theatre were as good as, if not better than, those in the original positive pressure design.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, T.

The ongoing Ebola virus (EBOV) disease epidemic in Western Africa claimed more than 11,300 lives and was associated with secondary cases outside Africa, demonstrating that filoviruses pose a global health threat. Bats constitute an important natural reservoir of filoviruses, including viruses of the recently identified Cuevavirus genus within the Filoviridae family. However, the interactions of filoviruses with bat cells are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether filoviruses employ different strategies to enter human and bat cells. For this, we examined host cell entry driven by glycoproteins (GP) from all filovirus species into cell lines of human and fruit bat origin. We show that all GPs were able to mediate entry into human and most fruit bat cell lines with roughly comparable efficiency. In contrast, the efficiency of entry into the cell line EidNi/41 derived from a straw-colored fruit bat varied markedly between the GPs of different filovirus species. Furthermore, inhibition studies demonstrated that filoviruses employ the same host cell factors for entry into human, non-human primate and fruit bat cell lines, including cysteine proteases, two pore channels and NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C1 molecule). Finally, processing of GP by furin and the presence of the mucin-like domain in GP were dispensable for entry into both human and bat cell lines. Collectively, these results show that filoviruses rely on the same host cell factors for entry into human and fruit bat cells, although the efficiency of the usage of these factors might differ between filovirus species.","publish_time":"2016-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmann, Markus; Gonz\u00E1lez Hern\u00E1ndez, Mariana; Berger, Elisabeth; Marzi, Andrea; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca96f361ba8d99dedbd1421fe735d230e86f7797.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4762945.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26901159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Western Africa"],"keyphrases":["cell lines of human","fruit bat cell lines","host cell entry","fruit bat cells","fruit bat origin","straw-colored fruit bat","host cell factors","efficiency of entry","interactions of filoviruses","cell line EidNi","non-human primate","GPs of different filovirus species","important natural reservoir of filoviruses","family Filoviridae","Filoviridae family","comparable efficiency","processing of GP","Western Africa","different strategies","ongoing Ebola virus","NPC1","EBOV","cysteine proteases","disease epidemic","pore channels","domain","Niemann-Pick C1 molecule","severe hemorrhagic fever","glycoproteins","lives","furin","presence","mucin","Cuevavirus genus","marburgviruses","members","secondary cases","humans","Bats","global health threat","inhibition studies","usage","contrast","results"],"language":"en"},

The treatment of lipid disorders was revolutionized with the introduction of statins which have become the most important therapeutic option available today to reduce and prevent atherosclerosis and its detrimental consequences like cardiovascular diseases and stroke. With and optimized reduction of elevated LDL levels with statins, the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) can be reduced by 30%, indicating a residual remaining risk of 70% for the development and progression of CVD notifying still a high medical need for more effective antilipidemic drugs. Consequently, the search for novel lipid-modifying drugs is still one of the most active areas in research and development in the pharmaceutical industry. Major focus lies on approaches to LDL-lowering drugs superior to statins with regard to efficacy, safety, and patient compliance and on approaches modifying plasma levels and functionality of HDL particles based on the clinically validated inverse relationship between high-plasma HDL levels and the risk for CVD. The available drugs today for the treatment of dyslipidemia are small organic molecules or nonabsorbable polymers for binding of bile acids to be applied orally. Besides small molecules for novel targets, biological drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, antisense or gene-silencing oligonucleotides, peptidomimetics, reconstituted synthetic HDL particles and therapeutic proteins are novel approaches in clinical development are which have to be applied by injection or infusion. The promising clinical results of several novel drug candidates, particularly for LDL cholesterol lowering with monoclonal antibodies raised against PCSK9, may indicate more than a decade after the statins, the entrance of new breakthrough therapies to treat lipid disorders.","publish_time":"2015-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kramer, Werner","journal":"Metabolic Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41c4b60cad3cbf877abae55869362628707b31b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122375.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330256/; https://doi.org/10.1007/164_2015_15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available drugs","different drugs","novel approaches","biological drugs","novel lipid","drugs superior","effective antilipidemic drugs","treatment of lipid disorders","plasma levels","high-plasma HDL levels","novel targets","introduction of statins","clinical development","treatment of dyslipidemia","functionality of HDL particles","LDL cholesterol","novel drug candidates","small molecules","monoclonal antibodies","cardiovascular diseases","progression of CVD","optimized reduction of elevated LDL levels","reconstituted synthetic HDL particles","small organic molecules","residual remaining risk","therapeutic proteins","important therapeutic option available","high medical need","promising clinical results","different modes of action","nonabsorbable polymers","peptidomimetics","gene-silencing oligonucleotides","efficacy","entrance of new breakthrough therapies","patient compliance","research","safety","detrimental consequences","regard","inverse relationship","binding of bile acids","atherosclerosis","stroke","active areas","pharmaceutical industry","Major focus","decade","PCSK9","armamentarium","injection","infusion"],"language":"en"},

Statistical analyses, such as traditional mean tests, rank order tests, two-step cluster analysis, and principal component analysis were used to analyze the survey data. The results revealed that Chinese tend to be more tolerant of risk than Japanese and South Koreans. In all three countries, the threats of global warming, cancer, traffic accidents, and fire were perceived as higher-order risks, while infectious diseases and threats from high technology were perceived as lower-order risks. Looking across the entire multi-country sample, we found that Chinese participants perceived greater risk in typhoons, SARS, and drugs; Japanese saw greater risk from gas explosions and potential threats coming over the Internet; while people in all three countries identified earthquakes as a primary risk. These differences in risk perception reflect the natural and socioeconomic conditions in the three countries. Although the study did not emphasize differences in risk perception within countries based on demographic factors such as education, age, and gender, we found that differences based on education and age tended to be greater in China and South Korea than in Japan. We also found that men perceived greater risks than women in China and South Korea, while in Japan it was the opposite with women perceiving greater risks. A comparison of these results with previous studies reveals a bias in past studies toward student samples and indicates the need for more representative samples in multi-country surveys.","publish_time":"2008-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhai, Guofang; Suzuki, Takeshi","journal":"Environ Monit Assess","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f57e1e7c2d9bdd9c24ecfe19297db274a88f05a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0524-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18841489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan","China","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["risk perception","greater risks","tolerant of risk","primary risk","countries","Japanese saw greater risk","public\u2019s perception of risk","China","differences","lower-order risks","higher-order risks","Multi-country surveys","South Koreans","rank order tests","potential threats","women","entire multi-country sample","age","education","results","threats of global warming","past studies","previous studies","student samples","representative samples","Chinese participants","traditional mean tests","two-step cluster analysis","principal component analysis","bias","gas explosions","infectious diseases","typhoons","SARS","drugs","high technology","demographic factors","cancer","need","socioeconomic conditions","traffic accidents","earthquakes","opposite","Statistical analyses","Internet","people","comparison","gender","study","questionnaire","survey data"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have shown significant variation in the incidence of viral, bacterial and mixed infections, with conflicting risk associations for mortality. We aimed to determine the risk association of microbial aetiologies with hospital mortality in severe CAP, utilising a diagnostic strategy incorporating molecular testing. Our primary hypothesis was that respiratory viruses were important causative pathogens in severe CAP and was associated with increased mortality when present with bacterial pathogens in mixed viral-bacterial co-infections. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2014 to July 2015 was conducted in a tertiary hospital medical intensive care unit in eastern Singapore, which has a tropical climate. All patients diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia were included. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were in the study. Microbial pathogens were identified in 84 (71.8%) patients. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections occurred in 18 (15.4%) of patients. Isolated viral infections were present in 32 patients (27.4%); isolated bacterial infections were detected in 34 patients (29.1%). Hospital mortality occurred in 16 (13.7%) patients. The most common bacteria isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae and the most common virus isolated was Influenza A. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that serum procalcitonin, APACHE II severity score and mixed viral-bacterial infection were associated with increased risk of hospital mortality. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.99 (95% CI 1.30\u2013151.05, p = 0.03) for hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are common organisms isolated in severe community-acquired pneumonia. Mixed viral-bacterial infections may be associated with an increased risk of mortality.","publish_time":"2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quah, Jessica; Jiang, Boran; Tan, Poh Choo; Siau, Chuin; Tan, Thean Yen","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b64cf541af6560335b092dc63f67dd4cd81691a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6122562.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3366-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180811/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["Influenza A.

Abstract Background Respiratory syncytial virus and Influenza virus infections are known causes of hospital admission in infants. It is less well known the pattern of virus infections in infants under 6 months of age in the outpatient setting. Objective To describe the clinical and epidemiological pattern of community-acquired viral respiratory infections in infants under 6 months. Patients and methods A cohort of infants from the 8 and 9 Madrid Health Districts was followed by telephone calls every two weeks since birth during the epidemic winter season. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected in pre-designed questionnaires. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained in every patient with symptoms compatible with respiratory infection. Diagnosis of the more common virus was made with direct immunofluorescence and nucleic acid amplification test (PCR). Results Were recruited 316 newborns. The 1,865 phone calls made (median 4 for every child), produced 106 visits, and the illness confirmed in 89 illness. Rhinitis (91 %) and cough (69 %) were the most common symptoms. Upper respiratory infection was the principal clinical diagnosis (84.5 %), and 17 of the 72 samples (23.2 %) were positive. Most common viruses were RSV (41.1 %) and rhinovirus (35.2 %). Of the children visited, 17 out of 106 (16 %) (5.3% of the cohort) were admitted to hospital. Diagnoses were febrile syndrome and bronchiolitis. We did not find any epidemiological factor associated with viral respiratory infection in positive cases. Conclusions In our population most of the respiratory infections in infants are minor and do not need hospital assistance. Rhinovirus and RSV are the major pathogens. We did not find any epidemiological factor associated with viral respiratory infection.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bueno Campa\u00F1a, M.; Calvo Rey, C.; V\u00E1zquez \u00C1lvarez, M.

The ongoing outbreak of this respiratory disease has posed critical challenges for the public health, research, and medical communities around the world. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with lung cancer in China. Methods We collected data on 397 inpatients from a single center during 4 weeks of the epidemic time (2020 group), and that of 2504 inpatients during the same period (4 weeks) in last 5 years (2015-2019 group). A questionnaire was used to investigate medical demands among 803 patients with lung cancer at 65 hospitals from 20 provinces in China during the epidemic. We evaluate the incidence data of COVID-19 in Guangdong to analyze the tendency of the pandemic and compared it with inpatient data. Results The number of hospitalizations and lung cancer-related surgeries had steadily increased in 2015-2019 but reduced by an average of 26.72% (133.8) and 57.18% (45.4) in 2020. The hospital capacity decreased by 28.00% (35 inpatient beds) during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period. The epidemic caused a greater impact on medical work related to lung cancer after the Chinese New Year holiday. Patients were most concerned about longer waiting time for outpatient services, inpatient beds, physical examinations, or surgeries (406; 50.56%), the possibility of infection with the novel coronavirus (359; 44.71%), difficulties in getting to a hospital due to transportation outages (279; 34.74%). Patients in stage I and II showed less fear about disease progression (14, 18.18%; 4, 14.81%), lower proportions of delayed medical arrangement (15, 19.48%; 6, 22.22%) and less complain about complex treatment procedures (12, 15.58%, 5, 18.52%). Patients in high-infected area (345, 56.74%) complained more frequently about longer booking periods than in low-infected area (61, 31.28%). Conclusion Treatment of patients with lung cancer has been affected by the epidemic to some extent. We provide suggestions on both clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies of lung cancer to optimize the process regarding to the currently urgent circumstances. The demand for medical support among patients with lung cancer or other life-threatening diseases should be given sufficient attention, especially during the current COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Rui; Wu, Lin; Zhang, Chao; Chu, Qian; Hu, Jie; Lin, Gen; Yang, Lin; Li, Ji-Sheng; Yang, Xue-Ning; Yang, Jin-Ji; Zhou, Qing; Wu, Yi-Long; Zhong, Wen-Zhao","journal":"JTO Clinical and Research Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e0faecc9e902ff951402b9e28321acd14c5f878.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364320300588?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtocrr.2020.100053; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666364320300588","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["treatment strategies of lung cancer","lung cancer-related surgeries","Conclusion Treatment of patients","epidemic time","epidemic period","medical work","medical demands","medical support","medical communities","impact of COVID","inpatient data","incidence data of COVID","inpatient beds","current COVID","respiratory disease","pandemic","disease progression","weeks","ongoing outbreak","China","inpatients","world","group","lower proportions of delayed medical arrangement","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease","complex treatment procedures","low-infected area","high-infected area","greater impact","novel coronavirus","hospital capacity","outpatient services","critical challenges","public health","physical examinations","clinical diagnosis","life-threatening diseases","research","hospitals","Chinese New Year holiday","huge burden","sufficient attention","SARS-CoV","way","billions of people","single center","process","provinces","number of hospitalizations","healthcare system","possibility of infection","fear","suggestions","periods","Guangdong","urgent circumstances","transportation outages","tendency","years","questionnaire","stage","Methods","difficulties","study","extent","average"],"language":"en"},

We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Material and methods The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an \u201Conline\u201D registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids.

Improved etiological insight is needed to improve clinical management and prevention of ARIs. METHODS: Clinical and demographic information and throat swabs were collected from 607 patients from 2011 to 2013 in Shandong Province, China. Multiplex RT-PCR (SeeplexTM RV detection, Seegene) was performed to detected 12 respiratory viral pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 607 hospitalized patients were enrolled from 2011 to 2013. Viruses were identified in 35.75 % (217/607) of cases, including 78 influenza virus A and B (IVA and IVB), 47 para-influenza viruses (PIVs), 41 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 38 adenovirus (ADV). For the children under 15 year old, the common detected viruses were influenza viruses, RSV, PIVS and ADV, while the principal respiratory viruses were human coronaviruses (HCoV), PIVs, influenza viruses for the old adults. Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 15.67 % of patients. Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ARI. The peak of ARI caused by the respiratory viruses occurred in winter. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated respiratory viruses were the major cause of hospitalized ARI patients in Shandong Province, influenza virus was the most common detected, RSV was the highest incidence among the young children (\u22645 years). These findings also gave a better understand of virus distribution among different age and seasons, which help to consider potential therapeutic approaches and develop effective prevention strategies for respiratory virus infection.","publish_time":"2015-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ti; Li, Zhong; Zhang, Shengyang; Song, Shaoxia; Julong, Wu; Lin, Yi; Guo, Nongjian; Xing, Chunyan; Xu, Aiqiang; Bi, Zhenqiang; Wang, Xianjun","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/355eb5b5bf565e8e432d8746982b5100764db289.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4606902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26467854/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0388-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiplex","ADV","ARI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["principal respiratory viruses","para-influenza viruses","multiple viruses","common detected viruses","respiratory virus infection","respiratory syncytial virus","hospitalized patients","virus distribution","detectable virus","acute respiratory infections","respiratory viral pathogens","PIVs","RSV","major cause of hospitalized ARI patients","prevention of ARIs","Shandong Province","ADV","peak of ARI","young children","years","clinical management","year old","Co-infections","old adults","effective prevention strategies","dominant viral etiologies responsible","HCoV","human coronaviruses","SeeplexTM RV detection","highest incidence","Multiplex RT-PCR","demographic information","potential therapeutic approaches","seasons","throat swabs","IVA","Seegene","BACKGROUND","IVB","different age","study","Improved etiological insight","METHODS","total","adenovirus","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","China","cases","winter","findings"],"language":"en"},

The application of antiviral drugs provides an immediate and direct control of influenza virus infection. At present, the major strategy for managing patients with influenza is through targeting conserved viral proteins critical for viral replication. Two classes of conventional antiviral drugs, the M2 ion channel blockers and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are frequently used. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern, highlighting the urgent need for the development of alternative treatments. Novel classes of antiviral compounds or biomolecules targeting viral replication mechanism are under development, using approaches including high-throughput small-molecule screening platforms and structure-based designs. In response to influenza virus infection, host cellular mechanisms are triggered to defend against the invaders. At the same time, viruses as obligate intracellular pathogens have evolved to exploit cellular responses in support of their efficient replication, including antagonizing the host type I interferon response as well as activation of specific cellular pathways at different stages of the replication cycle. Numerous studies have highlighted the possibility of targeting virus\u2013host interactions and host cellular mechanisms to develop new treatment regimens.

Intensive care respirators were specifically developed for the use in patients with pathological lung mechanics. Nevertheless, modern anesthesia machines offer similar technical capabilities including a number of different modes.

Here, we studied IL17A from five lagomorphs, European rabbit, pygmy rabbit, brush rabbit, European brown hare, and American pika. We observed that this protein is highly conserved between these species, with a similarity of 97\u201399% in leporids and ~88% between leporids and American pika. The exon/intron structure, N-glycosylation sites, and cysteine residues are conserved between lagomorphs. However, at codon 88, one of the interaction sites between IL17A and its receptor IL17RA, there is an Arg\u003EPro mutation that only occurs in European rabbit and European brown hare. This could induce critical alterations in the IL17A structure and conformation and consequently modify its function. The differences observed between leporids and humans or rodents might also represent important alterations in protein structure and function. In addition, as for other interleukins, IL17A sequences of human and European rabbit are more closely related than the sequences of human and mouse or European rabbit and mouse. This study gives further support to the hypothesis that European rabbit might be a more suitable animal model for studies on human IL17.","publish_time":"2015-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neves, Fabiana; Abrantes, Joana; Almeida, Tereza; Costa, Paulo P.; Esteves, Pedro J.","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c6efd303141e36db6479eda5dc5d2a379e6bcd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4692990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26788019/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/367670","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Francisella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["European rabbit","brush rabbit","pygmy rabbit","IL17A structure","leporids","European brown hare","IL17A sequences of human","protein structure","intron structure","human IL17","mouse","lagomorphs","American pika","function","important alterations","interaction sites","critical alterations","N-glycosylation sites","rabbits","suitable animal model","extracellular pathogens","Francisella tularensis","studies","cysteine residues","receptor IL17RA","Arg","hares","humans","rodents","interleukins","support","hypothesis","conformation","host defense","zoonotic disease tularemia","Pro mutation","exon","species","study","differences","similarity","codon","addition"],"language":"en"},

Although DNA-based assays are more sensitive than bacterial culture in detecting the pathogen, the molecular results are often inconsistent and challenged by doubts on false positives, such as those due to system- and environment-derived contaminations. In addition, these molecular tools require expensive laboratory instruments. Therefore, establishing molecular tools for field use require simpler molecular platforms. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in a routine clinical bacteriology laboratory. A simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in the same platform has been developed in recent years. This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In this study, we attempted to utilize this method for rapid detection of A. baumannii. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Species-specific primers were designed to test the utility of this method. Clinical samples of A. baumannii were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to bacterial culture and a polymerase chain reaction method. All positive samples isolated from sputum were confirmed to be the species of Acinetobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The RealAmp method was found to be simpler and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification, and could distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. DNA was extracted by simple boiling method. Compared to bacterial culture, the sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting A. baumannii was 98.9% and 75.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The RealAmp assay only requires a single unit, and the assay positivity can be verified by visual inspection. Therefore, this assay has great potential of field use as a molecular tool for detection of A. baumannii.","publish_time":"2013-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qinqin; Zhou, Yanbin; Li, Shaoli; Zhuo, Chao; Xu, Siqi; Huang, Lixia; Yang, Ling; Liao, Kang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e03474356ba4414f631c94959e3c22e8e239c49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3699609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23843955/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0066406","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Detection of Acinetobacter baumannii","RealAmp method","isothermal amplification method","bacterial culture","simple boiling method","molecular tools","molecular results","real-time detection of DNA amplification","species of Acinetobacter","RealAmp assay","rapid detection of","simpler molecular platforms","Acinetobacter calcoaceticus","polymerase chain reaction method","specificity of RealAmp","Acinetobacter genomic species","better use","assay positivity","real-time loop","system","sensitivity","Clinical samples of","great potential of field use","DNA-based assays","routine clinical bacteriology laboratory","useful results","positive samples","expensive laboratory instruments","single unit","Species-specific primers","S rRNA gene sequencing","METHODOLOGY","SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS","pathogen","portable device capable","doubts","environment-derived contaminations","sputum","addition","fluorescence","BACKGROUND","false positives","visual inspection","recent years","utility","CONCLUSION","study"],"language":"en"},

Work by others suggests that these stress responses, which are part of the integrated stress response (ISR), may benefit rather than repress reovirus replication. Here, we report that compared to untreated cells, treating cells with sodium arsenite (SA) to activate the ISR prior to infection enhanced viral protein expression, percent infectivity, and viral titer. SA-mediated enhancement was not strain-specific, but was cell-type specific. While SA pre-treatment of cells offered the greatest enhancement, treatment within the first 4 h of infection increased the percent of cells infected. SA activates the heme-regulated eIF2\u03B1 (HRI) kinase, which phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03B1) to induce stress granule (SG) formation. Heat shock (HS), another activator of HRI, also induced eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation and SGs in cells. However, HS had no effect on percent infectivity or viral yield but did enhance viral protein expression. These data suggest that SA pre-treatment perturbs the cell in a way that is beneficial for reovirus and that this enhancement is independent of SG induction. Understanding how to manipulate the cellular stress responses during infection to enhance replication could help to maximize the oncolytic potential of reovirus.","publish_time":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lutz, Michael M.; Worth, Megan P.; Hinchman, Meleana M.; Parker, John S.L.; Ledgerwood, Emily D.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43d98a92044a0de6683fc54fb2b5694a828856d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631071.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11060563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216693/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISR","SA","HRI","SG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["percent of cells","SA pre-treatment of cells","reovirus infection","untreated cells","stress granule","cellular stress responses","SA-mediated enhancement","reovirus replication","viral protein expression","viral yield","percent infectivity","viral titer","h of infection","integrated stress response","eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","greatest enhancement","ISR","HS","oncolytic potential of reovirus","heme-regulated eIF2\u03B1","cell-type specific","canonical translation","activator of HRI","independent of SG induction","eukaryotic translation initiation factor","kinase","alpha","mechanism","effect","sodium arsenite","way","progeny virion production","formation","SGs","Heat shock","data","Work"],"language":"en"},

Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The performance of AEIS for the period 2006 through 2008 was evaluated based on a number of response times (RT) and the public health impact. After implementation of the system, the apparent overall shortened RT was mainly due to the shortening of personnel response time (PRT) and the time needed to draft a new questionnaire that incurred as personnel-system interface (PSI); PRT dropped from a fluctuating range of 9.8 \u223C28.8 days in the first four months to \u003C10 days in the following months and remained low till 2008 (0.88\u00B11.52 days). The PSIs for newly emerged infectious diseases were 2.6 and 3.4 person-hours for H5N1 in 2007 and chikungunya in 2008, respectively, a much improvement from 1142.5 person-hours for SARS in 2003. The duration of each rubella epidemic cluster was evaluated as public health impact and showed a shortening trend (p = 0.019) that concurred with the shortening of PRT from 64.8\u00B147.3 to 25.2\u00B138.2 hours per cluster (p\u003C0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The first evaluation of the novel instrument AEIS that had been used to assist Taiwan\u0027s multi-level government for infectious diseases control demonstrated that it was well integrated into the existing public health infrastructure. It provided flexible tools and computer algorithms with friendly interface for timely data collection, integration, and analysis; as a result, it shortened RTs, filled in gaps of personnel lacking sufficient experiences, created a more efficient flow of response, and identified asymptomatic/mild cases early to minimize further spreading.

Abstract Understanding routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a key element in establishing both occupational health and public health guidelines in the Covid-19 management. SARS-CoV-2 is found in patients\u2019 airways, including for asymptomatic ones. Available data suggest a underestimated risk of air transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, but also when he speaks or simply breezes, the majority of emitted particles being smaller than 1 \u03BCm. Preliminary data indicate the presence of viral RNA in air samples and on surfaces far from source patients. However, it is important to note that the detection of viral genetic material by RT-PCR does not mean that the virus is alive or infectious. According to data on the quantification of the infective power of such aerosol with small size particles and if such air transmission was confirmed, a larger use of N95 respirators should be promoted particularly in health care units.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gehanno, JF; Bonneterre, V; Andujar, P; Pairon, JC; Paris, C; Petit, A; Verdun-Esquer, C; Durand-Moreau, Q; Brochard, P","journal":"Archives des Maladies Professionnelles et de l\u0026#039;Environnement","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/217aa2e3582a495fe7f49d38865ec1182d824b5e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.admp.2020.04.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1775878520309875?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1775878520309875","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":["FFP2"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission du SARS","the quantification","the majority","is found in patients","risque de transmission","telle transmission","public health guidelines in the Covid","the infective power","indicate the presence","viral RNA in air samples","mean that the virus is alive or infectious","it is important to note that the detection","if such air transmission was confirmed","ARN viral","patients sources","viral genetic material","donn\u00E9es pr\u00E9liminaires","donn\u00E9es r\u00E9centes","fonction de donn\u00E9es","key element in establishing both occupational health","surfaces far from source patients","d\u00E9tection de mat\u00E9riel g\u00E9n\u00E9tique viral","N95 respirators should be promoted particularly in health care units","PCR does","quantification du pouvoir","surfaces distantes","According to","sant\u00E9 publique","a\u00E9rosols g\u00E9n\u00E9r\u00E9s","a\u00E9rosols de petite taille","such aerosol with small","but also when he speaks","emitted particles being smaller than","when an infected individual coughs","sneezes","simply breezes","larger","airways","indications de port","including","underestimated risk","\u00E9laboration des strat\u00E9gies","type FFP2","protections respiratoires","\u03BCm","travail","hypoth\u00E8se","However","suggest","pr\u00E9sence","Abstract Understanding routes","diam\u00E8tre","cadre de la gestion","pr\u00E9vention","\u00E9l\u00E9ment fondamental","litt\u00E9rature","Preliminary","management","fait de particules","asymptomatic ones","voies a\u00E9riennes","connaissance des modes","composition","Available","toux","crise","voie a\u00E9rienne","respiration","milieu de soin","\u00B5m","\u00E9ternuements","parole"],"language":"fr"},

AIMS: To investigate changes in ED presentations and care processes, and the relationship of patient demand and ED staff resources to waiting times and processing times. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected administrative data from January 1999 to April 2005 in an emergency department in a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. All patients attending the emergency department during the study period were included. Monthly attendance data were retrieved and analysed to determine both qualitative and quantitative changes in the patterns of presentation to the ED using prospectively gathered data. RESULTS: Total ED attendances decreased by 25% during the study with little seasonal variation. The admission rate and the use of ambulances increased steadily and significantly. Medical patients are increasing proportionately, but trauma patients are decreased in number. CONCLUSION: There have been major changes in the patterns of ED attendances and ED waiting times over the study period in this teaching hospital ED. Decreasing overall ED numbers are offset by an increasingly elderly population and a more complex case mix. Reducing clinical staff numbers appears to reduce the ED\u2019s capacity to provide timely assessments and care and to function as hospital gatekeepers. Restoring staff numbers to previous levels may improve the quality and timeliness of ED services. It is necessary to refine measures of ED complexity and workload to determine appropriate staffing levels in the future.","publish_time":"2009-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wai, Abraham K. C.; Chor, C.

Although infertility does not jeopardize the physical survival of infertile couples, it does jeopardize their future quality of life. Human infertility can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are age-dependent, and their effects may become irreversible if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent irreversible childlessness. Accordingly, each case of infertility should be evaluated comprehensively to establish its position of priority. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) makes it possible to separate fertilization and pregnancy in time. Whereas pregnant women infected with coronavirus may have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, gametes do not transmit COVID-19. Thus, performing ovarian stimulation and fertilization without delay, freezing the resulting embryos and delaying embryo transfer until the end of the pandemic appears to be the best strategy at present.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tesarik, Jan","journal":"Reprod Biomed Online","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03add7bd1360dba1182a5f4c8803413f8bf483a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141638.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1472648320301814; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648320301814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354664/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human infertility","case of infertility","fertilization","time","COVID","current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease","irreversible childlessness","future quality of life","non-life-threatening diseases","resulting embryos","care providers","increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes","delaying embryo transfer","effects","gametes","appropriate measures","physical survival of infertile couples","attention of medical","ART","best strategy","ovarian stimulation","pregnancy","reproductive technology","age-dependent","present","number of factors","pregnant women","position of priority"],"language":"en"},

For the fast system, the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the basic reproduction number and the existence for infection-free and unique virus infectious equilibria are obtained, and the threshold conditions on the local stability of equilibria are established. In the slow system, except for the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the existence for disease-free, unique endemic and two endemic equilibria are obtained, and the sufficient conditions on the local stability for disease-free and unique endemic equilibria are established. To return to the coupling system, the local stability for the virus- and disease-free equilibrium, and virus infectious but disease-free equilibrium is established.

Most commercial mAbs studied as antiviral agents in the clinic have either directly or indirectly targeted human immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or hepatitis C virus infections. However, the ability of mAbs to bind to specific targets and utilize various anti-infective modes of action would seem to make them well suited for the prevention and/or treatment of a wider variety of viral diseases. A number of factors, including the continuing need for innovative medicines for viral infections, the global spread of viral infections, and increased government funding for the study of pathogen countermeasures, have prompted companies to reconsider mAbs as antiviral agents.

Using the ATS/ERS classification of interstitial pulmonary diseases in premature infants, infants and children is problematic, since UIP, RB-ILD and AIP do not occur at this age.

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 618 inpatients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection admitted to 36 Spanish hospitals between July 2009 and February 2010. Risk factors evaluated included host-related factors and clinical data at admission. We developed a composite index of severe in-hospital complications (SIHC), which included: mortality, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and requirement for resuscitation maneuvers. Six factors were independently associated with SIHC: age \u003E45 years, male sex, number of comorbidities, pneumonia, dyspnea, and confusion. From the \u03B2 parameter obtained in the multivariate model, a weight was assigned to each factor to compute the individual influenza risk score. The score shows an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77. The SIHC rate was 1.9 % in the low-risk group, 10.3 % in the intermediate-risk group, and 29.6 % in the high-risk group. The odds ratio for complications was 21.8 for the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group.

Median age was 48 years (22 to 68); 14 out of 26 leukemia patients (54 %) had circulating blasts at transplant, 20 (50 %) evaluable patients had poor-risk cytogenetics, 12 (25 %) had prior SCT, and 10 (21 %) received stem cells from a mismatch donor. All patients received tacrolimus with or without methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. At the time of analysis, 13 patients (27 %) were alive and disease free. Engraftment was complete in all patients. The median time to ANC recovery (\u003E500) was 12 days (range, 6\u201328). The most common grade III and IV toxicities were mucositis and infections. Eighteen patients (43 %) developed grade II\u2013IV acute GVHD, and eight (26 %) had extensive chronic GVHD. Of 44 evaluable patients for response, 28 (64 %) achieved a complete remission (CR), and seven (15 %) had a partial remission after the transplant.

Questionnaires were used to collect prospective data on 1,122 cases with influenza-like illness at our medical institutions. The independent predictors of influenza A virus were identified on the basis of demographic features and the clinical symptoms of the patients who tested positive for influenza A virus in the RIDT test. Of the 1,122 cases tested, 389 (34.7%) were positive for the influenza A virus. The median age of the influenza-positive patients was 14, and 58.9% of the patients were male. The symptoms fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and headache were statistically dominant. A history of recent contact with persons suffering from influenza or influenza-like illness at home, school, or in the workplace was significantly more common in the positive group than in the negative group. Pneumonia was observed in 2 (0.5%) of the positive patients, but the symptoms were only severe enough to require hospitalization in 1 of the 2. No deaths were observed among the 389 RIDT-positive patients. Although the spread of influenza A virus was both rapid and extensive, mainly among children under the age of 18, it seemed to be mild. Appropriate interpretation of the RIDT on the basis of recent clinical information, and early treatment with antiviral drugs might help to prevent severe illness from influenza pandemics in the future.","publish_time":"2010-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takayama, Koji; Kuramochi, Jin; Oinuma, Takeshi; Kaneko, Hiromi; Kurasawa, Satoshi; Yasui, Makito; Okayasu, Kaori; Ono, Hiroshi; Inase, Naohiko","journal":"J Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/722488dad8eed5b703ea748c376afb56d76ecc5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101646.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza-positive patients","influenza pandemics","spread of influenza","pandemic influenza outbreak","independent predictors of influenza","virus","RIDT-positive patients","rapid influenza diagnostic test","clinical symptoms","positive group","RIDT test","severe illness","symptoms fever","clinical features of outpatients","basis of recent clinical information","cases","basis of demographic features","negative group","median age","history of recent contact","early treatment","use","rhinorrhea","antiviral drugs","type","persons","cough","prospective data","headache","school","children","home","future","Appropriate interpretation","medical institutions","workplace","Questionnaires","hospitalization","deaths","male","Pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

We identified a complex sequence of molecular events including shock-dependent and reperfusion-dependent responses that offer a new comprehensive approach for consequences of HS. Shock-dependent initializing mechanisms include the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and CD14 and play a catalyzing role for subsequent phenotypic changes following resuscitation. The early immediate response genes iNOS and COX-2 promote the inflammatory response by the rapid and excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) may regulate the induction of iNOS during the ischemic phase of shock. NO is an important signaling molecule which is involved in redox-sensitive mechanisms including the downstream activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB. NO-dependent NF-\u03BAB activation promotes the induction of inflammatory cytokine expression during the reperfusion phase. Peroxynitrite-mediated direct toxicity and NO-mediated inflammatory toxicity contribute to organ injury. Patients suffering consequences of severe HS are susceptible to systemic inflammation, organ injury, and mortality if physiologic and therapeutic mechanisms are ineffective in limiting the activation of the inflammatory cascade.","publish_time":"2001-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hierholzer, Christian; Billiar, Timothy R.","journal":"Langenbecks Arch Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68015166c0f97e6219839835b9b613ff2f2dbadf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory response","inflammatory toxicity","inflammatory cascade","induction of iNOS","Shock-dependent initializing mechanisms","dependent NF-\u03BAB activation","induction of inflammatory cytokine expression","consequences of HS","Hemorrhagic shock","reperfusion-dependent responses","ischemic phase of shock","induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase","downstream activation of nuclear factor","therapeutic mechanisms","COX","transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor","consequences of severe HS","organ injury","reperfusion phase","redox-sensitive mechanisms","early immediate response genes iNOS","excessive production of nitric oxide","direct toxicity","successful resuscitation","systemic inflammation","mortality","new comprehensive approach","catalyzing role","subsequent phenotypic changes","survival","results","complex sequence of molecular events","cyclooxygenase","initiation","CD14","Patients","molecule","Peroxynitrite","prostaglandins","HIF"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesize that these diagnostic markers do not predict relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in the critically ill or injured patient. METHODS: Chart review of surgical, trauma, and medical patients admitted over 7 years to a critical care unit was performed to evaluate cortisol levels drawn for suspicion of RAI, which was defined as a cortisol concentration \u003C25 mcg/dl. Laboratory parameters were defined as hyponatremia \u003C135 mmol/l, hyperkalemia \u003E5.3 mmol/l, hypercalcemia \u003E2.55 mmol/l (10.2 mg/dl), hypoglycemia \u003C3.89 mmol/l (70 mg/dl), and eosinophilia \u003E5%. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients had cortisol levels drawn. Fifty-seven percent were male and their mean age was 59 years. Fifty-three percent had RAI. Average cortisol level was 30.5 \u03BCg/dl. No significant differences were seen in mean potassium, sodium, calcium, or glucose levels between RAI and non-RAI patients. Few patients had laboratory values consistent with RAI. In fact, many with RAI had opposite findings: 75% had hypernatremia, 90% had hypokalemia, 100% had hypocalcemia, and 97% had hyperglycemia. Eosinophilia was statistically significant (P = 0.026).

Systemic activation of the inflammatory system after aortic injury may play a role in the development of LOI. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of beta-blockers on systemic inflammation and the development of LOI after distal type AAD. A total of 49 patients, who were admitted with distal type AAD and treated conservatively, were examined. White blood cell (WBC) count, serum CRP level, and arterial blood gases were measured serially. Forty patients received beta-blocker treatment within 24 h of the onset, while 9 patients received no beta-blocker treatment. Maximum WBC count, maximum CRP level, lowest PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio, and patient background were compared between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups according to age, sex, coronary risk factors, blood pressure, serum level of CRP, WBC count, and oxygenation index on admission. Beta-blocker treatment was associated with lower maximum WBC count (P = 0.0028) and lower maximum serum CRP level (P = 0.0004). The minimum P/F ratio was higher in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without (P = 0.0076). Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of a beta-blocker was an independent negative determinant of LOI (P/F ratio \u2264200 mmHg). In conclusion, early use of beta-blockers prevented excessive inflammation and LOI after distal type AAD, suggesting a pleiotropic effect of beta-blockers on the inflammatory response after AAD.","publish_time":"2008-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jo, Yusuke; Anzai, Toshihisa; Sugano, Yasuo; Naito, Kotaro; Ueno, Koji; Kohno, Takashi; Yoshikawa, Tsutomu; Ogawa, Satoshi","journal":"Heart Vessels","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e135ced2effa0828634a4070e3fff0964fddffe0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LOI","AAD","WBC","LOI (P/F"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["beta-blocker treatment","serum level of CRP","maximum CRP level","distal type AAD","patients","lower maximum serum CRP level","lower maximum WBC count","development of LOI","minimum P","F ratio","distal type acute aortic dissection","independent negative determinant of LOI","blood pressure","systemic inflammation","pleiotropic effect of beta-blockers","groups","serum C-reactive protein","White blood cell","arterial blood gases","early use of beta-blockers","excessive inflammation","inflammatory system","aortic injury","oxygenation index","inflammatory response","Systemic activation","independent predictor of lung oxygenation impairment","coronary risk factors","age","sex","elevation","lowest PaO","administration","role","patient background","conclusion","FiO","admission","onset","mmHg","Multivariate analysis","study","difference","aim","total"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of LR blood on morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that the use of LR blood does not improve outcome in trauma patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of trauma patients transfused at a level 1 Trauma Center from 2001 to 2004. Between 2002 and 2003, LR blood was transfused. Prior to that time and subsequent to it, non-leukoreduced (NLR) blood was transfused. This created two historical comparison groups. Data collected included patient demographics, units of blood transfused, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital days, ventilator days, injury severity score (ISS), mortality, presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and infectious complications. A multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score was calculated. RESULTS: The distribution of patients was as follows: 284 patients received only NLR blood, 153 received only LR blood, and 58 received at least one unit of each. The mean ISS was similar (NLR: 26, LR: 24; P \u003E 0.1). No differences were seen between groups in units transfused (6.2 vs. 5.5), number of ICU days (8.2 vs. 9.0), number of hospital days (16.9 vs. 18.6), number of ventilator days (6.1 vs. 5.7), incidence of ARDS (8.3% vs. 8.5%), MODS score (5.5 vs. 5.9), mortality rate (15.1% vs. 15.7%), or infection rate (36% vs. 30%) (P \u003E 0.1).

These data on the medical complications of VCA should allow for precautions to avoid poor outcomes, data to better provide informed consent to potential recipients, and result in improvements in graft and patient outcomes as VCA finds a place as a therapeutic option for selected patients.","publish_time":"2016-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uluer, Mehmet C.; Brazio, Philip S.; Woodall, Jhade D.; Nam, Arthur J.; Bartlett, Stephen T.; Barth, Rolf N.","journal":"Curr Transplant Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbc5fa7e536c164819f865e3283e58eca9d8563f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzIyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcomes of graft","patient outcomes","poor outcomes","field of VCA","data","medical complications of VCA","impressive good outcomes","risks","selective publishing of negative outcomes","current outline of complications","patient survival","new field","experienced poor results","improvements","place","vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation","potential recipients","informed consent","precautions","therapeutic option","increasing experience","communications","upper extremity","collective knowledge","challenges","selected patients","review","attempt","facial transplantation","conference proceedings","decade","morbidities","objective"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the physiologically active mediator and mediates the main pathophysiological actions in RAS. Ang II exerts the effects by activating its receptors, primarily type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R). Most of the known pathophysiological effects of Ang II are mediated by AT1R activation. The precise physiological function of AT2R is still not clear. Generally, AT2R is considered to oppose the effects of AT1R. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein scavenger receptor-1 (LOX-1) is one of the major receptors responsible for binding, internalizing and degrading ox-LDL. The activation of LOX-1 has been known to be related to many pathophysiological events, including endothelial dysfunction and injury, fibroblast growth, and vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Many of these alterations are present in atherosclerosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia and remodeling. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of a cross-talk between LOX-1 and Ang II receptors. Their interplays are embodied in the reciprocal regulation of their expression and activity. Their interplays are involved in a series of signals. Recent studies suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important signals responsible for their cross-talk. This paper reviews these aspects of dyslipidemia and RAS activation.","publish_time":"2011-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xianwei; Phillips, M.

Chest X-ray exhibited bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. First-line empirical antibiotics were started and influenza discarded. Patient evolved with severe respiratory failure, associated with hemoptysis, and rapidly severe hemodynamic compromise. Despite neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning, respiratory failure increased. Accordingly, veno-venous ECMO was initiated, with bilateral femoral extraction and jugular return. After ECMO connection, there was no significant improvement in oxygenation, and low pre-membrane saturations and low arterial PaO(2) of the membrane showed that we were out of the limits of the rated flow. Thus, a second membrane oxygenator was installed in parallel. Afterward, oxygenation improved, with subsequent perfusion enhancement. Regarding etiology, due to high suspicion index, Leptospira serology was performed, coming back positive and meropenem was maintained. The patient ultimately recovered and experience excellent outcome. The clinical relevance of the case is the scared evidence of leptospirosis-associated severe respiratory failure treated with ECMO. This experience emphasizes the importance of an optimal support, which requires enough membrane surface and flow for an obese, highly hyperdynamic patient, during this reversible disease. A high index of suspicion is needed for an adequate diagnosis of leptospirosis to implement the correct treatment, particularly in the association of respiratory failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and an epidemiological-related context.","publish_time":"2017-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cantwell, Tamara; Ferre, Andr\u00E9s; Van Sint Jan, Nicolette; Blamey, Rodrigo; Dreyse, Jorge; Baeza, Cristian; Diaz, Rodrigo; Regueira, Tom\u00E1s","journal":"J Artif Organs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28e3d7d64740e1b0c6b04865a5f8413bacad00ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102126.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe respiratory failure","association of respiratory failure","membrane surface","Patient laboratory","hyperdynamic patient","membrane oxygenator","low pre-membrane saturations","oxygenation","high suspicion index","high index of suspicion","ECMO connection","severe hemodynamic compromise","veno-venous ECMO","rated flow","low arterial PaO","bilateral femoral extraction","scared evidence of leptospirosis","year-old obese farmer","adequate diagnosis of leptospirosis","experience excellent outcome","bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates","abdominal pain","hemoptysis","pulmonary hemorrhage","diarrhea","fever","headache","myalgia","case","tachycardic","Chest X-ray","acute kidney injury","significant improvement","prone positioning","neuromuscular blockade","Leptospira serology","mice","thrombocytopenia","jugular return","optimal support","symptoms onset","direct contact","progressive dyspnea","correct treatment","line empirical antibiotics","influenza","epidemiological-related context","subsequent perfusion enhancement","importance","reversible disease","etiology","clinical relevance","contaminated drain","days","limits","meropenem"],"language":"en"},

BALF samples were harvested and used for mNGS as well as microbiological detection. Infectious bacteria or fungi were defined according to relative abundance and number of unique reads. We performed mNGS on 35 BALF samples from 32 patients. The positive rate reached 100% in the mNGS analysis of nine immunocompromised patients. Compared with the culture method, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 88.89% and a specificity of 74.07% with an agreement rate of 77.78% between these two methods. Compared with the smear method and PCR, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 77.78% and a specificity of 70.00%. In 13 cases, detection results were positive by mNGS but negative by culture/smear and PCR. The mNGS findings in 11/32 (34.4%) cases led to changes in treatment strategies. Linear regression analysis showed that diversity was significantly correlated with interval between disease onset and sampling. Dynamic changes in reads could indirectly reflect therapeutic effectiveness. BALF mNGS improves sensitivity of pathogen detection and provides guidance in clinical practice. Potential pathogens can be identified based on relative abundance and number of unique reads.

The most recent of these zoonotic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the Covid-19 epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to determine the mutation(s) in the sequence of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that might be favoring human to human transmission. An in silico approach was performed, and changes were detected in the S1 subunit of the receptor-binding domain of spike. The observed changes have significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy, compared to the one of the Bat-CoV to this receptor. The data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the one of Bat-CoV spike and ACE2.

To identify the virus, the infected cell culture supernatant was enriched for virus particles and a generic, PCR-based method was used to amplify potential viral sequences. Genomic sequence data of the alpaca isolate was obtained and compared with sequences of known viruses. The new alpaca virus sequence was most similar to recently designated Enterovirus species F, previously bovine enterovirus (BEVs), viruses that are globally prevalent in cattle, although they appear not to cause significant disease. Because bovine enteroviruses have not been previously reported in U.S. alpaca, we suspect that this type of infection is fairly rare, and in this case appeared not to spread beyond the original outbreak. The capsid sequence of the detected virus had greatest homology to Enterovirus F type 1 (indicating that the virus should be considered a member of serotype 1), but the virus had greater homology in 2A protease sequence to type 3, suggesting that it may have been a recombinant. Identifying pathogens that infect a new host species for the first time can be challenging. As the disease in a new host species may be quite different from that in the original or natural host, the pathogen may not be suspected based on the clinical presentation, delaying diagnosis. Although this virus replicated in MDBK cells, existing standard culture and molecular methods could not identify it. In this case, a highly sensitive generic PCR-based pathogen-detection method was used to identify this pathogen.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"McClenahan, Shasta D.; Scherba, Gail; Borst, Luke; Fredrickson, Richard L.; Krause, Philip R.; Uhlenhaut, Christine","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33ea5a062d23a8c46b7d6e9ba23f1c82f40fde29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3741315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950875/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068777","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["new alpaca virus sequence","detected virus","virus particles","cytopathic virus","new host species","Enterovirus F type","protease sequence","alpaca isolate","capsid sequence","type of infection","PCR-based method","designated Enterovirus species F","MDBK cells","sensitive generic PCR-based pathogen-detection method","Genomic sequence data","lung tissue of alpaca","bovine enteroviruses","natural host","case","sequences of known viruses","greatest homology","Madin-Darby bovine kidney","greater homology","original outbreak","significant disease","existing standard culture","potential viral sequences","severe respiratory infection","infected cell culture supernatant","molecular methods","BEVs","pathogens","time","clinical presentation","diagnosis","cattle","member of serotype","recombinant"],"language":"en"},

Since then, almost 2000 cases have been reported from 27 countries, with Saudi Arabia being the epicenter. This newly emerging virus is highly pathogenic and has a case mortality rate of 35%. It is similar to the CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in that both belong to the genus beta CoVs that are of zoonotic origin and cause lower respiratory infection. The natural reservoir for MERS-CoV remains unknown. Serological studies indicate that most dromedary camels in the Middle East have been infected with this virus, and they maybe the potential intermediate host. However, the mode of transmission from camels to humans is poorly understood. The majority of confirmed human cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission, most probably via respiratory route. Patients most at risk of developing severe MERS-CoV infection appear to be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer. Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is considered an ongoing public health problem, particularly for the Middle East region. In this chapter, we outline the prevailing information regarding the emergence and epidemiology of this virus, its mode of transmission and pathogenicity, its clinical features, and the potential strategies for prevention.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Gulfaraz; Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b60249e0ce1fdd295a48bdc922ae20da0b60959.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148737.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128194003000089; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128194003000089","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","severe MERS-CoV infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","respiratory route","chronic respiratory diseases","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome","lower respiratory infection","human transmission","viral respiratory illness","mode of transmission","human cases","Middle East region","emerging virus","Saudi Arabia","cardiac diseases","dromedary camels","potential strategies","potential intermediate host","zoonotic origin","hypertension","obesity","diabetes","epidemiology","clinical features","ongoing public health problem","prevailing information","emergence","pathogenicity","coronavirus","risk","genus beta CoVs","underlying conditions","natural reservoir","case mortality rate","Serological studies","countries","cancer","humans","chapter","prevention","Patients","epicenter","majority"],"language":"en"},

One of the discriminatory principles is the recognition of endogenous RNA modifications. Previous work has identified a couple of RNA modifications that impede activation of TLR signaling when incorporated in synthetic RNA molecules. Of note, work that is more recent has now shown that RNA modifications in their naturally occurring context can have immune-modulatory functions: Gm, a naturally occurring ribose-methylation within tRNA resulted in a lack of TLR7 stimulation and within a defined sequence context acted as antagonist.

Little information is available on the role of major traffic hubs, such as airports, in the transmission of respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza and a pandemic threat. We investigated the presence of respiratory viruses in the passenger environment of a major airport in order to identify risk points and guide measures to minimize transmission. METHODS: Surface and air samples were collected weekly at three different time points during the peak period of seasonal influenza in 2015\u201316 in Finland. Swabs from surface samples, and air samples were tested by real-time PCR for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43). RESULTS: Nucleic acid of at least one respiratory virus was detected in 9 out of 90 (10%) surface samples, including: a plastic toy dog in the children\u2019s playground (2/3 swabs, 67%); hand-carried luggage trays at the security check area (4/8, 50%); the buttons of the payment terminal at the pharmacy (1/2, 50%); the handrails of stairs (1/7, 14%); and the passenger side desk and divider glass at a passport control point (1/3, 33%). Among the 10 respiratory virus findings at various sites, the viruses identified were: rhinovirus (4/10, 40%, from surfaces); coronavirus (3/10, 30%, from surfaces); adenovirus (2/10, 20%, 1 air sample, 1 surface sample); influenza A (1/10, 10%, surface sample). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of pathogen viral nucleic acids indicates respiratory viral surface contamination at multiple sites associated with high touch rates, and suggests a potential risk in the identified airport sites. Of the surfaces tested, plastic security screening trays appeared to pose the highest potential risk, and handling these is almost inevitable for all embarking passengers.","publish_time":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ikonen, Niina; Savolainen-Kopra, Carita; Enstone, Joanne E.; Kulmala, Ilpo; Pasanen, Pertti; Salmela, Anniina; Salo, Satu; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S.; Ruutu, Petri","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c91fac9f0e239fab524c4595ebf8d0d8a5385f1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6116441.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3150-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30157776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International"],"locations":["Finland"],"keyphrases":["surface samples","respiratory viral surface contamination","air samples","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory virus findings","presence of respiratory viruses","transmission of respiratory infections","surfaces","risk points","identified airport sites","multiple sites","B viruses","various sites","major airport","highest potential risk","peak period of seasonal influenza","rhinovirus","adenovirus","Swabs","plastic security screening trays","luggage trays","passenger environment","Detection of pathogen viral nucleic acids","different time points","plastic toy dog","security check area","role of major traffic hubs","divider glass","order","real-time PCR","high touch rates","national travelling","children\u2019s playground","coronaviruses","rapid spread of infectious diseases possible","airports","passport control point","guide measures","HKU1","desk","CONCLUSIONS","handling","payment terminal","NL63","OC43","BACKGROUND","Little information","pandemic threat","METHODS","embarking passengers","buttons","pharmacy","RESULTS","handrails of stairs","Finland"],"language":"en"},

Exploitation of these ecosystems may foster the emergence of novel pathogens. We report the discovery of the first insect-associated nidovirus, tentatively named Cavally virus (CAVV). CAVV was found with a prevalence of 9.3% during a survey of mosquito-associated viruses along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire. Analysis of habitat-specific virus diversity and ancestral state reconstruction demonstrated an origin of CAVV in a pristine rainforest with subsequent spread into agriculture and human settlements. Virus extension from the forest was associated with a decrease in virus diversity (P \u003C 0.01) and an increase in virus prevalence (P \u003C 0.00001). CAVV is an enveloped virus with large surface projections. The RNA genome comprises 20,108 nucleotides with seven major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and -1b encode two large proteins that share essential features with phylogenetically higher representatives of the order Nidovirales, including the families Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, but also with families in a basal phylogenetic relationship, including the families Roniviridae and Arteriviridae. Genetic markers uniquely conserved in nidoviruses, such as an endoribonuclease- and helicase-associated zinc-binding domain, are conserved in CAVV. ORF2a and -2b are predicted to code for structural proteins S and N, respectively, while ORF3a and -3b encode proteins with membrane-spanning regions. CAVV produces three subgenomic mRNAs with 5\u2032 leader sequences (of different lengths) derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome. This novel cluster of mosquito-associated nidoviruses is likely to represent a novel family within the order Nidovirales.","publish_time":"2011-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zirkel, Florian; Kurth, Andreas; Quan, Phenix-Lan; Briese, Thomas; Ellerbrok, Heinz; Pauli, Georg; Leendertz, Fabian H.; Lipkin, W.

During Marburg virus (MARV) infection, large quantities of the viral glycoprotein GP are produced in the ER; this may result in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The most conserved pathway to trigger UPR is initiated by IRE1. Activation of IRE1 results in auto-phosphorylation, splicing of the XBP1 mRNA and translation of the XBP1s protein. XBP1s binds cis-acting UPR elements (UPRE) which leads to the enhanced expression of genes which should restore ER homeostasis. XBP1u protein is translated, if IRE1 is not activated. Here we show that ectopic expression of MARV GP activated the IRE1-XBP1 axis of UPR as monitored by UPRE luciferase assays. However, while at 24 h of infection with MARV IRE1 was phosphorylated, expression of XBP1s was only slightly enhanced and UPRE activity was not detected. The IRE1-XBP1 axis was not active at 48 h p.i. Co-expression studies of MARV proteins demonstrated that the MARV protein VP30 suppressed UPRE activation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed an RNA-dependent interaction of VP30 with XBP1u. Knock-out of IRE1 supported MARV infection at late time points. Taken together, these results suggest that efficient MARV propagation requires specific regulation of IRE1 activity.","publish_time":"2019-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rohde, Cornelius; Becker, Stephan; Kr\u00E4hling, Verena","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78138c22f695836b6da58f74c78a8066204a2b12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6746283.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2019.1659552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","UPRE","MARV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MARV IRE1","MARV infection","MARV protein VP30","Activation of IRE1 results","IRE1-XBP1 axis of UPR","ectopic expression of MARV GP","expression of XBP1s","XBP1s protein","UPRE activation","efficient MARV propagation","Co-expression studies of MARV proteins","specific regulation of IRE1 activity","UPRE activity","XBP1u protein","h of infection","enhanced expression of genes","XBP1 mRNA","unfolded protein response","UPRE luciferase assays","cis-acting UPR elements","viral glycoprotein GP","ER homeostasis","optimal viral replication","Co-immunoprecipitation analyses","RNA-dependent interaction of VP30","large quantities","cellular signalling pathways","late time points","auto-phosphorylation","translation","Marburg virus","Viruses","conserved pathway","Knock"],"language":"en"},

The responsible pathogen is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit admission. Evidence of cerebrovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 is limited. We herein report six patients who developed acute stroke during COVID-19 infection. METHODS A retrospective case series of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs, who developed clinical and neuroimaging evidence of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS Six patients were identified (5 men); median age was 69 years (range 57-82). Stroke subtypes were ischemic (4, 67%) and hemorrhagic (2, 33%). All patients but one had pre-existing vascular risk factors. One patient developed encephalopathy prior to stroke, characterized by focal seizures and behavioral abnormalities. COVID-19-related pneumonia was severe (i.e., requiring critical care support) in 5/6 cases (83%). Liver enzyme alteration and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation were registered in all cases. Four patients (67%) manifested acute kidney failure prior to stroke. Four patients (67%) had abnormal coagulation tests. The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients: five died (83%) and the remaining one (17%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS: 4). CONCLUSIONS Both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke can complicate the course of COVI-19 infection. In our series, stroke developed mostly in patients with severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, liver enzymes and LDH were markedly increased in all cases, and the outcome was poor.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morassi, Mauro; Bagatto, Daniele; Cobelli, Milena; D\u0027Agostini, Serena; Gigli, Gian Luigi; Bn\u00E0, Claudio; Vogrig, Alberto","journal":"Journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09885-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hemorrhagic stroke","Stroke subtypes","COVID","severe pneumonia","neuroimaging evidence of acute stroke","SARS-CoV","retrospective case series of patients","cases","asymptomatic infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute kidney failure","LDH","related pneumonia","outcome","multiorgan failure","liver enzymes","coronavirus disease","clinical spectrum","affected countries","Liver enzyme alteration","critical care support","Evidence of cerebrovascular complications","intensive care unit admission","RT-PCR","lactate dehydrogenase","reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","nasopharyngeal swabs","focal seizures","responsible pathogen","median age","elevation","METHODS","pre-existing vascular risk factors","course of COVI","years","range","behavioral abnormalities","encephalopathy","men","CONCLUSIONS","majority","abnormal coagulation tests","BACKGROUND Italy","RESULTS","mRS"],"language":"en"},

However, the wearer\u0027s vigorous movements during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may affect the protective performance of the respirator. Herein, we aimed to assess the effects of chest compressions (CCs) on the protective performance of respirators. METHODS: This crossover study evaluated 30 healthcare providers from 1 emergency department who performed CC with real-time feedback. The first, second, and third groups started with a cup-type, fold-type, and valve-type respirator, respectively, after which the respirators were randomized for each group. The fit factors were measured using a quantitative fit testing device before and during the CC in each experiment. The protection rate was defined as the proportion of respirators achieving a fit factor \u2265100. RESULTS: The fold-type respirator had a significantly greater protection rate at baseline (100.0% \u00B1 0.0%) compared to the cup-type (73.6% \u00B1 39.6%, P = .003) and valve-type respirators (87.5% \u00B1 30.3%, P = .012). During the CC, the fit factor values significantly decreased for the cup-type (44.9% \u00B1 42.8%, P \u003C .001) and valve-type respirators (59.5% \u00B1 41.7%, P = .002), but not for the fold-type respirator (93.2% \u00B1 21.7%, P = .095). CONCLUSIONS: The protective performances of respirators may be influenced by CC. Healthcare providers should identify the respirator that provides the best fit for their intended tasks.","publish_time":"2017-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Hyungoo; Oh, Jaehoon; Lim, Tae Ho; Kang, Hyunggoo; Song, Yeongtak; Lee, Sanghyun","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3d247dfd60d48b2dcbb5996371c80b01f99dd22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5662401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29049235/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000008308","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["valve-type respirators","cup-type","fold-type respirator","protective performance of respirators","proportion of respirators","protective performances of respirators","Healthcare providers","best fit","fit factors","fit factor values","quantitative fit testing device","infection protection","greater protection rate","emergency departments","cardiopulmonary resuscitation","CCs","wearer\u0027s vigorous movements","crossover study","OBJECTIVE","real-time feedback","effects of chest compressions","intended tasks","baseline","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","groups","experiment"],"language":"en"},

Responding to these diseases requires a workforce trained in multi-disciplinary approaches to zoonotic disease research and control. It is difficult to deliver multidisciplinary and one health training globally because of the limited number of higher education programs that support such training. In low and middle-income countries where the impacts of emerging zoonotic diseases are felt more directly there is enthusiasm for such training and the use of e-technology can foster international, long-term collaborations. OBJECTIVES: To provide health training for infectious diseases research and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration. METHODS: We designed and simultaneously held two training workshops, one focused on pediatric infectious diseases and another on emerging infectious diseases to meet the objective. Both workshops had pre- and post-workshop activities for multi-disciplinary methods with an emphasis on the use of mobile technologies to enhance emerging infectious diseases surveillance and research for public health professionals in Egypt. Faculty and scientists from all universities in Egypt and from the National Research Center were invited to participate. RESULTS: 85 participants attended, 31 abstracts were submitted, and over a 3 year period 3 international grant applications were submitted, and 4 abstracts were presented at international conferences. An online forum was developed to continue building collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: Interactive on-site workshops are suitable for providing multi-disciplinary training for disease surveillance, research and disease control. Participants shared the opinion that grant proposal and scientific manuscript writing were important skills that they felt they did not have. Long term investments in workshops of this nature are needed to build upon the excitement generated by these activities.","publish_time":"2018-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roess, Amira; Lahm, Sally; Kabbash, Ibrahim; Saad-Hussein, Amal; Shaalan, Ashraf; Rasslan, Ossama; Mohamed, Mohamed","journal":"Annals of global health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c26c2b6908dc534b970fa78f8658e272ef54f60d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6748232.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779513/; https://doi.org/10.29024/aogh.2372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Research Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases research","training workshops","health training","pediatric infectious diseases","emerging infectious diseases surveillance","multi-disciplinary training","infectious diseases of zoonotic origin","zoonotic disease research","impacts of emerging zoonotic diseases","Egypt","multi-disciplinary methods","disease surveillance","disease control","multi-disciplinary approaches","National Research Center","Interactive on-site workshops","international grant applications","international conferences","multidisciplinary collaboration","participants","abstracts","public health professionals","use of e","post-workshop activities","use of mobile technologies","proposal","emphasis","scientific manuscript writing","recent years","limited number of higher education programs","technology","important skills","middle-income countries","H5N1","H1N1","MERSCoV","opinion","universities","CONCLUSIONS","year period","workforce","Long term investments","scientists","long-term collaborations","nature","Faculty","enthusiasm","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","online forum","RESULTS","excitement"],"language":"en"},

The pathology associated with FIP (multifocal granulomatous vasculitis) is considered to be elicited by exaggerated activation and subsequent extravasation of leukocytes. As changes in the expression of adhesion molecules on circulating leukocytes precede their margination and emigration, we reasoned that the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules may be altered in FIP. In present study, the expression of principal adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte transmigration (CD15s, CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD49d, and CD54) on peripheral blood leukocytes from cats with naturally occurring FIP (n =15) and controls (n =12) was quantified by flow cytometry using a formaldehyde-based rapid leukocyte preparation technique. T- and B-lymphocytes from FIP patients exhibit higher expression of both subunits (CD11a and CD18) composing the \u03B22 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1. In addition, the expression of the \u03B14 subunit (CD49d) of the \u03B21 integrin very late antigen (VLA)-4 was elevated on B-lymphocytes from FIP patients. The expression of CD11b and CD18, that combine to form the \u03B22 integrin macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1), was elevated on monocytes, whereas the density of CD49d was reduced on this population in FIP. Granulocytes of FIP cats displayed an increased expression of the \u03B1 chain of Mac-1 (CD11b). These observations suggest that leukocytes from FIP patients show signs of systemic activation causing them to extravasate into surrounding tissues and ultimately contribute to pyogranuloma formation seen in FIP.","publish_time":"2013-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olyslaegers, Dominique A.J.; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Desmarets, Lowiese M.B.; Vermeulen, Ben L.; Dewerchin, Hannah L.; Nauwynck, Hans J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28f011a19f486f4a75b587e5f298b302e2da0864.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117481.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513003428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910523/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513003428","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP patients","expression of CD11b","expression of adhesion molecules","Granulocytes of FIP cats","increased expression","higher expression","expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules","expression of principal adhesion molecules","CD18","circulating leukocytes","CD11a","\u03B21 integrin","leukocyte transmigration","\u03B22 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen","\u03B22 integrin macrophage","peripheral blood leukocytes","late antigen","subsequent extravasation of leukocytes","density of CD49d","B-lymphocytes","signs of systemic activation","systemic disease","exaggerated activation","rapid leukocyte preparation technique","\u03B1 chain of Mac","formaldehyde","CD15s","coronavirus","CD54","subunits","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis","surrounding tissues","wild felids","extravasate","LFA","VLA","margination","\u03B14 subunit","emigration","multifocal granulomatous vasculitis","pyogranuloma formation","present study","pathology","changes","observations","flow cytometry","monocytes","controls","addition","population"],"language":"en"},

This evolution includes technology, analytical capabilities, and, equally as important, education and training. The scientific bases, applications, interpretations, and lessons learned by those who have been intimately involved in the early years of microbial forensics need to be documented and transferred to the next generation of scientists and decision makers so that we can protect society from potential harm resulting from bioterrorism and biocrime. The burgeoning field of microbial forensics should be accompanied by a parallel development of educational infrastructure and resources targeted at the next generation of practitioners, as well as diverse elements for the policy, research, and law enforcement communities. A microbial forensics education program can be broad, providing information encompassing all aspects of the field from science to policy, or more focused depending on its purpose and target audience. Policy makers must have a general understanding of microbial forensics results and better appreciation of their implications in order to effect sound and defensible policy decisions.

A lymphoproliferative assay was developed in which mononuclear cells isolated from lymphoid tissues at different postinoculation and postchallenge days underwent a secondary in vitro stimulation with semipurified antigen obtained from PEDV-infected cell cultures.

The pigs inoculated with the attenuated virus showed a less intense response, the higher lymphocyte proliferation also corresponded to the mononuclear cells from mesenteric lymph nodes. Lymphocyte proliferation responses showed high correlations with protection against homologous challenge with virulent PEDV, and this correlation was higher in the gut associated lymphoid tissues (mesenteric lymph nodes).

Since mucosal immunity plays a critical role in protection against influenza virus infection, mucosal immunization is considered a promising vaccination route. However, except for live-attenuated vaccines, there are no effective killed or recombinant mucosal influenza vaccines to date. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nano-sized vesicles produced by gram-negative bacteria, and contain various bacterial components capable of stimulating the immune system of the host. We generated an OMV with low endotoxicity (fmOMV) by modifying the structure of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide and investigated its effect as an intranasal vaccine adjuvant in an influenza vaccine model. In this model, fmOMV exhibited reduced toll-like receptor 4-stimulating activity and attenuated endotoxicity compared to that of native OMV. Intranasal injection of the vaccine antigen with fmOMV significantly increased systemic antibody and T cell responses, mucosal IgA levels, and the frequency of lung-resident influenza-specific T cells. In addition, the number of antigen-bearing CD103\u002B dendritic cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes was significantly increased after fmOMV co-administration. Notably, the mice co-immunized with fmOMV showed a significantly higher protection rate against challenge with a lethal dose of homologous or heterologous influenza viruses without adverse effects. These results show the potential of fmOMV as an effective mucosal adjuvant for intranasal vaccines.","publish_time":"2017-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Tae-Young; Kim, Chang-Ung; Bae, Eun-Hye; Seo, Sang-Hwan; Jeong, Dae Gwin; Yoon, Sun-Woo; Chang, Kyu-Tae; Kim, Young Sang; Kim, Sang-Hyun; Kim, Doo-Jin","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74cc1a3efb04282e8e89616e58b7749183fc0146.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115551.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16312324; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.12.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28024958/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16312324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant mucosal influenza vaccines","influenza vaccine model","Abstract Influenza","potential of fmOMV","mucosal immunization","effective mucosal adjuvant","mucosal immunity","intranasal vaccines","fmOMV co-administration","heterologous influenza viruses","influenza virus infection","intranasal vaccine adjuvant","vaccine antigen","resident influenza-specific T cells","mucosal IgA levels","Intranasal injection","live-attenuated vaccines","attenuated endotoxicity","dendritic cells","number of antigen","low endotoxicity","native OMV","T cell responses","higher protection rate","nano-sized vesicles","Outer membrane vesicles","mice co-immunized","lethal dose of homologous","systemic antibody","acute respiratory disease","critical role","gram-negative bacteria","challenge","OMVs","frequency of lung","various bacterial components capable","mediastinal lymph nodes","CD103","receptor","major health problem","immune system","adverse effects","reduced toll","date","promising vaccination route","moiety of lipopolysaccharide","lipid","activity","structure","host","addition"],"language":"en"},

The amino acid sequence of the spike (S) protein, which is the principal target recognized by host immune cells, has multiple mutations that distinguish the two PEDV genotypes, G1 and G2. To determine whether these mutations lead to changes in antigenicity, as suggested by the failure of PEDV vaccines in China, we first optimized the codons of typical S genes of the CV777 vaccine strain (G1 subtype) and LNCT2 strain (G2 subtype) and expressed the recombinant full-length sequence of the S protein in a eukaryotic expression system. The IgG antibody levels of serum from mice immunized with purified S protein were markedly high. Antigenicity was compared by detection of polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) against the virus and S protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a serum cross-neutralization (SN) assay. Reactivity with the PAbs revealed significant cross-reactivity between the two PEDV subtypes, although there was a twofold difference in the antigenic responses based on PAb titers in the ELISA and IFA. Consistent with the variation in the S gene sequences, the SN titer suggested differences in the neutralization activity of the S protein between the two subtypes, which could explain the antigenic variation between the PEDV subtypes G1 and G2.","publish_time":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaobo; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Da; Shi, Hongyan; Zhang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Jiang, Shibo; Feng, Li","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c249ab80a664bd1afa12edf8f70ff44186fc1f1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087089.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26611909/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2694-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified S protein","PEDV subtypes G1","S gene sequences","PEDV genotypes","codons of typical S genes","G1 subtype","G2 subtype","failure of PEDV vaccines","ELISA","serum cross-neutralization","PAbs","antigenic variation","IFA","antigenicity","significant cross-reactivity","indirect immunofluorescence assay","LNCT2 strain","SN titer","antigenic responses","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","neutralization activity","multiple mutations","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","CV777 vaccine strain","host immune cells","recombinant full-length sequence","amino acid sequence","IgG antibody levels of serum","mice","differences","PAb titers","principal target","spike","small intestine of swine","vomiting","detection of polyclonal antibodies","China","coronavirus","eukaryotic expression system","twofold difference","dehydration","changes"],"language":"en"},

A recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses (including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes) has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans. Here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody CR6261 against lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus in ferrets, the optimal model of human influenza infection. Survival rates, clinically relevant disease signs such as changes in body weight and temperature, virus replication in lungs and upper respiratory tract, as well as macro- and microscopic pathology were investigated. Prophylactic administration of 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 prior to viral challenge completely prevented mortality, weight loss and reduced the amount of infectious virus in the lungs by more than 99.9%, abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions and largely prevented H5N1-induced lung pathology. When administered therapeutically 1 day after challenge, 30 mg/kg CR6261 prevented death in all animals and blunted disease, as evidenced by decreased weight loss and temperature rise, reduced lung viral loads and shedding, and less lung damage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant animal model of influenza and justify clinical development of this approach as intervention for both seasonal and pandemic influenza.","publish_time":"2010-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Friesen, Robert H.

For this purpose, we established four types of cell lines (referred to as G(Gln)-NA, G(Arg)-NA, G(Gln)-BHK, and G(Arg)-BHK cells, respectively) by transfecting either the G(Gln)-cDNA or G(Arg)-cDNA into two kinds of cells, murine neuroblastoma C1300 (clone NA) and nonneuronal BHK-21. Both G(Gln)-NA and G(Arg)-NA cells produced G proteins when they were treated with 5 mM sodium butyrate, but only G(Arg)-NA cells formed syncytia at the neutral pH, which was suppressed by anti-G antiserum. The sodium butyrate-treated G(Arg)-NA cells fused also with sodium butyrate-treated NA cells under coculture conditions, but neither with untreated NA cells nor with BHK-21 cells. On the other hand, both G(Gln)-BHK and G(Arg)-BHK cells constitutively produced G proteins, but no syncytium was produced at the neutral pH. G(Arg)-BHK cells, however, formed syncytia with the sodium butyrate-treated NA cells when they were cocultured. These results suggest that only G(Arg) has a potential ability to produce syncytia of NA cells regardless of cell types by which G(Arg) protein was produced and also suggest that a certain cellular factor(s) is required for the syncytium formation, the factor(s) which is lacking in BHK-21 and untreated NA cells but is produced by the sodium butyrate-treated NA cells.","publish_time":"1992-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morimoto, Kinjiro; Ni, Ya-Jin; Kawai, Akihiko","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f2b9149316e0de6a5f1a9f5b9eb84e8687cc8d5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290696M; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290696M","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BHK cells","syncytia of NA cells","untreated NA cells","produced G proteins","sodium butyrate-treated G","sodium butyrate-treated NA cells","kinds of cells","avirulent type G","anti-G antiserum","clone NA","Gln","types of rabies virus G protein","interactions of host cells","nonneuronal BHK","cell types","formed syncytia","types of cell lines","cDNA","neutral pH","syncytium formation","certain cellular factor","murine neuroblastoma C1300","coculture conditions","potential ability","glutamine","arginine","position","hand","results","purpose"],"language":"en"},

This was most evident in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with JHM. Such CNS lesions were not observed in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the MHV3 strain. An in vitro system is described in which the rat glial RN2 cell line functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. Shortly after inoculation, this virus establishes a persistent infection in which there is a cyclical rise and fall in titer with an accompanying cytopathology. Furthermore, this host cell confers a thermal lability which the virus does not demonstrate in the fully permissive host cell, L-2. By comparison, infection of RN2 cells with the prototype MHV3 is aborted immediately. In the persistent infection of RN2 cells with measles virus, Hall\u00E9 strain, the cell again confers a temperature sensitivity which the virus does not possess when replicating in Vero cells. This appears to be the first instance in which a cloned cell line of glial origin determines the outcome of the infectious process, discriminating in favor of a neurotropic variant which possesses a tropism for the glia in vivo. Systems such as the one described here may now offer a specific screening procedure for selecting, identifying and characterizing the nature of neurotropic viruses.","publish_time":"1977-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucas, Alexandra; Flintoff, Wayne; Anderson, Robert; Percy, Dean; Coulter, Marion; Dales, Samuel","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867477901313; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867477901313","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHM","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JHM virus","measles virus","persistent infection of RN2 cells","permissive host cell","Abstract Infection of mice","neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus","MHV3 strain","discriminating host","rat glial RN2 cell line functions","cloned cell line of glial origin","Hall\u00E9 strain","neurotropic variant","Vero cells","nature of neurotropic viruses","demyelinating lesions","CNS lesions","prototype MHV3","outcome","titer","favor","thermal lability","infectious process","tropism","instance","temperature sensitivity","comparison","cyclical rise","specific screening procedure","accompanying cytopathology","inoculation","oligodendroglia","Systems"],"language":"en"},

Bronchiectasis is now again increasingly diagnosed, and its renewed interest has resulted in further in-depth studies in children and adults. However, diagnostic labeling of childhood bronchiectasis by radiology using adult-derived criteria has substantial limitations. Thus, pediatric-derived criteria are advocated. A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails PBB (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by chest computed tomography (CT) scan (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggest that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (e.g., immune deficiency). Treatment is aimed at achieving a cure in those at the milder end of the spectrum to limiting further deterioration in those with severe \u201Cirreversible\u201D radiological bronchiectasis.

Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.

RATIONALE: Prioritising both critical care initiation and continuation is paramount to save the greatest number of lives. It enables to allocate scarce resources in priority to those with the highest probability of benefiting from them. It is fully ethical provided it relies on objective and widely shared criteria, thus preventing arbitrary decisions and guaranteeing equity. Prioritisation seeks to fairly allocate treatments, maximise saved lives, gain indirect life benefits from prioritising exposed healthcare and similar workers, give priority to those most penalised as a last resort, and apply similar prioritisation schemes to all patients. PRIORITISATION STRATEGY: Prioritisation schemes and their criteria are adjusted to the level of resource scarcity: strain (level A) or saturation (level B). Prioritisation yields a four level priority for initiation or continuation of critical care: P1 \u2013 high priority, P2 \u2013 intermediate priority, P3 \u2013 not needed, P4 \u2013 not appropriate. Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient\u2019s wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition. Initial priority level must be reassessed, at least after 48 h once missing decision elements are available, at the typical turning point in the disease\u2019s natural history (ICU days 7 to 10 for COVID-19), and each time resource scarcity levels change. For treatments to be withheld or withdrawn, a collegial decision-making process and information of patient and/or next of kin are paramount. PERSPECTIVE: Prioritisation strategy is bound to evolve with new knowledge and with changes within the epidemiological situation.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leclerc, Thomas; Donat, Nicolas; Donat, Alexis; Pasquier, Pierre; Nicolas, Libert; Schaeffer, Elodie; D\u2019aranda, Erwan; Cotte, Jean; Fontaine, Bruno; Perrigault, Pierre-Fran\u00E7ois; Michel, Fabrice; Muller, Laurent; Meaudre, Eric; Veber, Beno\u00EEt","journal":"Anaesthesia, critical care \u0026 pain medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d93cbfee211ad63c8e9b91dca885115c8d557d1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352556820300916; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352556820300916?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426441/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.05.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["level priority","PRIORITISATION STRATEGY","Initial priority level","similar prioritisation schemes","high priority","intermediate priority","level of resource scarcity","level B","continuation of critical care","critical care initiation","treatments","similar workers","information of patient","patient transfers","saved lives","shared criteria","ill patients","time resource scarcity levels","logistical resources","scarce resources","prioritising exposed healthcare","pre-existing chronic condition","evolution of acute condition","continuous inflow of COVID","greatest number of lives","indirect life benefits","clinical frailty","patient\u2019s wishes","disease\u2019s natural history","typical turning point","severity","account","P2","P1","capacity increases","ICU days","strain","finite human","missing decision elements","changes","arbitrary decisions","collegial decision-making process","P3","RATIONALE","saturation","resort","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND","new knowledge","objective","epidemiological situation","P4","equity","highest probability","PERSPECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

In HIV-1 the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes are in a second reading frame relative to the structural group-specific antigen (gag), and their synthesis is dependent upon frameshifting. This ensures that a strictly regulated ratio of structural proteins and enzymes, which is critical for HIV-1 replication and viral infectivity, is maintained during protein synthesis. The frameshift element in HIV-1 RNA is an attractive target for the development of a new class of anti HIV-1 drugs. However, a number of examples are now emerging of human genes using \u22121 frameshifting, such as PEG10 and CCR5. In this study we have compared the HIV-1 and PEG10 frameshift elements and shown they have distinct functional characteristics. Frameshifting occurs at several points within each element. Moreover, frameshift modulators that were isolated by high-throughput screening of a library of 114,000 lead-like compounds behaved differently with the PEG10 frameshift element. The most effective compounds affecting the HIV-1 element enhanced frameshifting by 2.5-fold at 10 \u03BCM in two different frameshift reporter assay systems. HIV-1 protease:gag protein ratio was affected by a similar amount in a specific assay of virally-infected cultured cell, but the modulation of frameshifting of the first-iteration compounds was not sufficient to show significant effects on viral infectivity. Importantly, two compounds did not affect frameshifting with the human PEG10 element, while one modestly inhibited rather than enhanced frameshifting at the human element. These studies indicate that frameshift elements have unique characteristics that may allow targeting of HIV-1 and of other viruses specifically for development of antiviral therapeutic molecules without effect on human genes like PEG10 that use the same generic mechanism.","publish_time":"2015-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cardno, Tony S.; Shimaki, Yosuke; Sleebs, Brad E.; Lackovic, Kurt; Parisot, John P.; Moss, Rebecca M.; Crowe-McAuliffe, Caillan; Mathew, Suneeth F.; Edgar, Christina D.; Kleffmann, Torsten; Tate, Warren P.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/744d46b0f14b803df7af7eac3967bf1a4d4c1449.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4598141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26447468/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human PEG10 element","human element","enhanced frameshifting","targeting of HIV","modulation of frameshifting","PEG10 frameshift elements","frameshift modulators","human genes","new class of anti HIV","synthesis of proteins","viral infectivity","protein synthesis","iteration compounds","effective compounds","different frameshift reporter assay systems","specific assay","translation of viral","gag protein ratio","protease","regulated ratio of structural proteins","integrase enzymes","structural group-specific antigen","unique characteristics","reading frame relative","overlapping reading frames","distinct functional characteristics","development of antiviral therapeutic molecules","rare cases cellular mRNA results","library","infected cultured cell","\u03BCM","reverse transcriptase","significant effects","high-throughput screening","attractive target","viruses","fold","replication","lead","drugs","studies","number of examples","generic mechanism","CCR5","points","study"],"language":"en"},

There are currently over 20 members of the PDI family each consisting of varying numbers of thioredoxin-like domains which, generally, assist in oxidative folding and disulphide bond rearrangement of peptides. While there is a large amount of redundancy in client proteins of the various PDIs, the size of the family would indicate more nuanced roles for the individual PDIs.

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people. Methods UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37\u201373 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19. Results Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99\u20130.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998\u20131.01; p = 0.208).

This collaboration should be within the framework of the International Health Regulations. Collaboration between countries should be encouraged in a way that acknowledges the benefits that derive from sharing biological material and establishing equitable collaborative research partnerships. The focus of pandemic preparedness should include upstream prevention through better collaboration between human and animal health sciences to enhance capacity to identify potential pathogens before they become serious human threats, and to prevent their emergence where possible.

Recombinant production and purification of the ferret CD4 ectodomain soluble protein allowed hybridoma generation and the generation of a mAb (FeCD4) showing strong binding to ferret CD4 protein and lymphoid cells by flow cytometry. FeCD4 bound to its cognate antigen post-fixation with paraformaldehyde (PFA) which is routinely used to inactivate highly pathogenic viruses. We have also used FeCD4 in conjunction with other immune cell markers to characterise ferret T cells in both primary and secondary lymphoid organs.

Patients with IPF may experience acute respiratory deteriorations; many of these acute declines are idiopathic and are termed acute exacerbations (AE) of IPF. In these cases, the exclusion of alternative causes of rapid deterioration, including heart failure, bilateral pneumonia or pulmonary embolism, is a challenging goal. AE may occur at any time during the course of IPF, although they are more common in patients with more progressive disease and gastroesophageal reflux. Surgical lung biopsy or even surgical procedures in organs other than the lungs may also trigger AE, mainly in rapidly progressive or advanced IPF. Current diagnostic criteria include the presence of new-onset ground glass opacities or airspace consolidation superimposed on an underlying usual interstitial pneumonia pattern seen on high-resolution computed tomography. The outcome is poor with a short-term mortality in excess of 50 % despite therapy. Currently, there is no treatment with demonstrated efficacy for AE-IPF: empirical high-dose corticosteroid therapy is generally used, with or without immunosuppressive agents, with limited evidence. On the other hand, there is hope that new treatments to slow down progression of IPF will translate into a reduction of AE-IPF\u2019s occurrence. In conclusion, although significant progress in assessing disease severity in IPF has been made, AEs remain unpredictable and are associated with a high risk of death. Improvements in our understanding of the etiology, risk factors, clinical predictors and epidemiology are needed. It is the goal of clinical researchers in the field to provide respiratory physicians with evidence-based guidance to identify patients who may benefit from therapy for preventing or treating AE-IPF.","publish_time":"2015-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luppi, Fabrizio; Cerri, Stefania; Taddei, Sofia; Ferrara, Giovanni; Cottin, Vincent","journal":"Intern Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d636812577658a9bc459948ebe2cf40de770033a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089322.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25672832/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-015-1204-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPF","AE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AE-IPF","course of IPF","progression of IPF","advanced IPF","progressive disease","reduction of AE","course of disease","Patients","progressive fibrotic disease","disease severity","acute respiratory deteriorations","high variability","acute declines","acute exacerbations","high risk of death","limited evidence","empirical high-dose corticosteroid therapy","Surgical lung biopsy","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","goal of clinical researchers","bilateral pneumonia","presence of new","pulmonary embolism","respiratory physicians","surgical procedures","risk factors","new treatments","clinical predictors","challenging goal","evidence-based guidance","underlying usual interstitial pneumonia pattern","airspace consolidation","heart failure","onset ground glass opacities","etiology","field","exclusion of alternative causes of rapid deterioration","high-resolution computed tomography","significant progress","demonstrated efficacy","short-term mortality","understanding","organs","excess","epidemiology","Current diagnostic criteria","gastroesophageal reflux","outcome","cases","immunosuppressive agents","IPF\u2019s occurrence","lungs","time","conclusion","Improvements","AEs","hand"],"language":"en"},

An assessment was made of the cytotoxic and antiviral activities and possible mode of action of the tannin ellagic acid from the leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa toward HeLa cells and three rhinoviruses, HRV-2, -3, and -4. METHODS: The antiviral property and mechanism of action of ellagic acid were evaluated using a sulforhodamine B assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with SYBR Green dye. Results were compared with those of the currently used broad-spectrum antiviral agent, ribavirin. RESULTS: As judged by 50% inhibitory concentration values, natural ellagic acid was 1.8, 2.3, and 2.2 times more toxic toward HRV-2 (38 \u03BCg/mL), HRV-3 (31 \u03BCg/mL), and HRV-4 (29 \u03BCg/mL) than ribavirin, respectively. The inhibition rate of preincubation with 50 \u03BCg/mL ellagic acid was 17%, whereas continuous presence of ellagic acid during infection led to a significant increase in the inhibition (70%). Treatment with 50 \u03BCg/mL ellagic acid considerably suppressed HRV-4 infection only when added just after the virus inoculation (0 h) (87% inhibition), but not before -1 h or after 1 h or later (\u003C20% inhibition). These findings suggest that ellagic acid does not interact with the HRV-4 particles and may directly interact with the human cells in the early stage of HRV infections to protect the cells from the virus destruction. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis revealed that 50 \u03BCg/mL ellagic acid strongly inhibited the RNA replication of HRV-4 in HeLa cells, suggesting that ellagic acid inhibits virus replication by targeting on cellular molecules, rather than virus molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Global efforts to reduce the level of antibiotics justify further studies on L. speciosa leaf-derived materials containing ellagic acid as potential anti-HRV products or a lead molecule for the prevention or treatment of HRV infection.","publish_time":"2014-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sang Wook; Kwon, Min Jung; Yoo, Ji Young; Choi, Hwa-Jung; Ahn, Young-Joon","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce6af0bb9b796bf3ddc44ddabdce04a7584957d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4052798.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885569/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HeLa","SYBR Green","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tannin ellagic acid","natural ellagic acid","\u03BCg","continuous presence of ellagic acid","suppressed HRV","treatment of HRV infection","RNA replication of HRV","potential anti-HRV products","early stage of HRV infections","HeLa cells","human cells","virus replication","virus molecules","virus inoculation","virus destruction","RT-PCR analysis","antiviral activities","antiviral property","Human rhinoviruses","inhibition rate of preincubation","ribavirin","Results","broad-spectrum antiviral agent","real-time reverse transcription-PCR","mechanism of action","cellular molecules","possible mode of action","leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa","speciosa leaf-derived materials","medical visits","cause billions of USD","lead molecule","sulforhodamine B assay","school","studies","prevention","inhibitory concentration values","cases","work absenteeism","level of antibiotics","HRVs","SYBR Green dye","Global efforts","significant increase","half","METHODS","BACKGROUND","times","CONCLUSIONS","findings","assessment","particles"],"language":"en"},

A sandwich immumoassay was employed by using a polyclonal antibody against F1 antigen of Y. pestis immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane and the same antibody conjugated to the UPT particles. The signal detection of the strips was performed by the UPT-based biosensor that could provide a 980 nm IR laser to excite the phosphor particles, then collect the visible luminescence emitted by the UPT particles and finally convert it to the voltage as a signal. V(T) and V(C) stand for the multiplied voltage units for the test and the control line, respectively, and the ratio V(T)/V(C) is directly proportional to the number of Y. pestis in a sample. We observed a good linearity between the ratio and log CFU/ml of Y. pestis above the detection limit, which was approximately 10(4) CFU/ml. The precision of the intra- and inter-assay was below 15% (coefficient of variation, CV). Cross-reactivity with related Gram-negative enteric bacteria was not found.

Very few cases of EV68 infection were described over the ensuing 40 years. However, in the past few years, an increase in severe respiratory tract infections associated with EV68 has been reported. We identified two clusters of EV68 infection in South London, UK, one each in the autumn/winters of 2009 and 2010. Sequence comparison showed significant homology of the UK strains with those from other countries including the Netherlands, Japan and the Philippines, which reported EV68 outbreaks between 2008 and 2010. Phylogenetic analysis of all available VP1 sequences indicated the presence of two modern EV68 lineages. The 2010 UK strains belonged to lineage 2. Lineage 1 could be further divided into two sub-lineages: some Japanese and Dutch strains collected between 2004 and 2010 form a distinct sub-lineages (sub-lineage 1.1), whereas other strains from the UK, Japan, Netherlands and Philippines collected between 2008 and 2010 represent sub-lineage 1.2. The UK 2009 strains together with several Dutch and Japanese strains from 2009/2010 represents one variant (1.2.1), whereas those from the Philippines a second variant (1.2.2). Based on specific deletions and substitutions, we suggest rules for the assignment of lineages and sub-lineages. Molecular epidemiological analysis indicates rapid recent evolution of EV68 and this may explain the recent findings of a global resurgence of EV68.

However, overall similarities in the clinical presentation of these dermatological manifestations have not yet been summarized. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of various cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 through three case reports and a literature review. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, OVID, and Google search engines for original and review articles. Studies written in the English language that mentioned cutaneous symptoms and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Eighteen articles and three additional cases reported in this paper were included in this review. Of these studies, 6 are case series and 12 are case report studies. The most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 was found to be maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform), presenting in 36.1% (26/72) patients. The other cutaneous manifestations included: a papulovesicular rash (34.7%, 25/72), urticaria (9.7%, 7/72), painful acral red purple papules (15.3%, 11/72) of patients, livedo reticularis lesions (2.8%, 2/72) and petechiae (1.4%, 1/72). Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50/72), however, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet. Skin lesion development occurred before the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days. Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions. CONCLUSION: Infection with COVID-19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sachdeva, Muskaan; Gianotti, Raffaele; Shah, Monica; Lucia, Bradanini; Tosi, Diego; Veraldi, Stefano; Ziv, Michael; Leshem, Eyal; Dodiuk-Gad, Roni P.","journal":"J Dermatol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a31f3f5ba855406525f763c92e8828596585538.json; document_parses/pdf_json/78e68426a54ef9394b6072221a12fb603d64f857.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381430/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923181120301493; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923181120301493?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2020.04.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","overview of various cutaneous manifestations","cutaneous symptoms","dermatological manifestations","common cutaneous manifestation of COVID","review articles","literature review","skin lesions","Majority of lesions","infection","case report studies","literature search","case series","various clinical presentations","case reports","livedo reticularis lesions","timely diagnosis","Google search engines","onset of respiratory symptoms","Skin lesion development","PubMed","English language","painful acral red purple papules","correlation","severity","hands","additional cases","overall similarities","paper","papulovesicular rash","feet","BACKGROUND","maculopapular exanthem","morbilliform","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","trunk","days","urticaria","petechiae"],"language":"en"},

Here, we performed long-term retrospective surveillance of hMPV infection among patients hospitalized in South Korea between 2007 and 2016 and investigated seasonal dynamics and clinical characteristics associated with each virus subtype/genotype. METHODS: Patient specimens were tested for hMPV and other respiratory viruses by commercial molecular assays. Medical records of hMPV-positive patients were reviewed, and hMPV subtype/genotype analysis was performed. We also collected meteorological data and analyzed relationships with hMPV activity. RESULTS: Of 23 694 specimens, 1275 (5.4%) were positive; among them, 94.0% were classified into 5 subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2). Some clinical manifestations differed according to hMPV genotype; however, there was no correlation between hMPV subtype and clinical outcome.

We have previously reported that ZIKV envelope protein domain III (EDIII) is a subunit vaccine candidate with cross-neutralization activity; however, like many other subunit vaccines, its efficacy is limited. To improve the efficacy of this subunit vaccine, we identified a nonneutralizing epitope on ZIKV EDIII surrounding residue 375, which is buried in the full-length envelope protein but becomes exposed in recombinant EDIII. We then shielded this epitope with an engineered glycan probe. Compared to the wild-type EDIII, the mutant EDIII induced significantly stronger neutralizing antibodies in three mouse strains and also demonstrated significantly improved efficacy by fully protecting mice, particularly pregnant mice and their fetuses, against high-dose lethal ZIKV challenge. Moreover, the mutant EDIII immune sera significantly enhanced the passive protective efficacy by fully protecting mice against lethal ZIKV challenge; this passive protection was positively associated with neutralizing antibody titers. We further showed that the enhanced efficacy of the mutant EDIII was due to the shielding of the immunodominant nonneutralizing epitope surrounding residue 375, which led to immune refocusing on the neutralizing epitopes. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that an intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccines is their artificially exposed immunodominant nonneutralizing epitopes, which can be overcome through glycan shielding. Additionally, the mutant ZIKV protein generated in this study is a promising subunit vaccine candidate with high efficacy in preventing ZIKV infections in mice. IMPORTANCE Viral subunit vaccines generally show low efficacy. In this study, we revealed an intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccine designs: artificially exposed surfaces of subunit vaccines contain epitopes unfavorable for vaccine efficacy. More specifically, we identified an epitope on Zika virus (ZIKV) envelope protein domain III (EDIII) that is buried in the full-length envelope protein but becomes exposed in recombinant EDIII. We further shielded this epitope with a glycan, and the resulting mutant EDIII vaccine demonstrated significantly enhanced efficacy over the wild-type EDIII vaccine in protecting animal models from ZIKV infections. Therefore, the intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccines can be overcome through shielding these artificially exposed unfavorable epitopes. The engineered EDIII vaccine generated in this study is a promising vaccine candidate that can be further developed to battle ZIKV infections.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tai, Wanbo; Chen, Jiawei; Zhao, Guangyu; Geng, Qibin; He, Lei; Chen, Yuehong; Zhou, Yusen; Li, Fang; Du, Lanying","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8f6c26a8275c6cbbeb30dc984f058902455ed52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6694833.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02187-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV EDIII","vaccine efficacy","engineered EDIII vaccine","recombinant EDIII","resulting mutant EDIII vaccine","mutant ZIKV protein","ZIKV infections","wild-type EDIII vaccine","enhanced efficacy","promising subunit vaccine candidate","high efficacy","ZIKV envelope protein domain","exposed surfaces of subunit vaccines","intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccine designs","intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccines","mutant EDIII immune sera","low efficacy","improved efficacy","promising vaccine candidate","IMPORTANCE Viral subunit vaccines","passive protective efficacy","study","exposed unfavorable epitopes","full-length envelope protein","exposed immunodominant nonneutralizing epitopes","high-dose lethal ZIKV challenge","pregnant mice","epitopes unfavorable","glycan shielding","Zika virus","residue","engineered glycan probe","stronger neutralizing antibodies","neutralizing antibody titers","passive protection","pregnant women","animal models","mouse strains","fetuses","cross-neutralization activity","fetal deaths","malformations","results"],"language":"en"},

This article aims to review the current nutrition literature pertaining to H\u0026N cancer patients and to present evidence-based strategies for nutritional support specific to this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Aggressive nutritional intervention is frequently required in the H\u0026N cancer patient population. Rehabilitating nutrition during operative and nonoperative treatment improves compliance with treatment, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. When and whether to establishing alternative enteral access are points of controversy, although recent evidence suggests prophylactic enteral feeding tube placement should not be universally applied. Perioperative nutritional optimization including preoperative carbohydrate loading and provision of arginine-supplemented immunonutrition has been shown to benefit at-risk H\u0026N cancer patients. SUMMARY: With multidisciplinary collaboration, H\u0026N cancer patients can receive individualized nutritional support to withstand difficult cancer treatment regimens and return to acceptable states of nutritional health.","publish_time":"2017-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nesemeier, Ryan; Dunlap, Neal; McClave, Stephen A.; Tennant, Paul","journal":"Curr Surg Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48e1e9b726076108125aa7500c2e4588fa19c959.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102400/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N cancer patients","N cancer patient population","difficult cancer treatment regimens","individualized nutritional support","nutritional support specific","Perioperative nutritional optimization","at-risk H","complex patients","Aggressive nutritional intervention","nonoperative treatment","success of treatment","acceptable states of nutritional health","recent evidence","present evidence-based strategies","RECENT FINDINGS","Rehabilitating nutrition","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","alternative enteral access","current nutrition literature pertaining","prophylactic enteral feeding tube placement","malnourished state","controversy","preoperative carbohydrate","compliance","varied reasons","provision of arginine","quality of life","multidisciplinary collaboration","head","neck","supplemented immunonutrition","clinical outcomes","SUMMARY","article"],"language":"en"},

Community-acquired pneumonia is a common illness and, while Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most frequent causative agent, atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella species are now identified as additional common aetiological agents. Since clinical and roentgenographic features poorly predict the aetiological agent in most cases of community-acquired pneumonia, empirical therapy is generally recommended. Nosocomial pneumonia is the second most common hospital-acquired infection and is associated with significant mortality. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus are the predominant causative pathogens. New techniques to improve the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia have been introduced, but their role has not been entirely clarified. Therapy directed toward the most likely pathogens (aerobic Gram-negative species and S. aureus) on an empirical basis is recommended until more specific information is obtained. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis should be treated with antimicrobial therapy directed toward S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. Because of the emergence of \u03B2-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, the choice of an antimicrobial agent has to be carefully considered. Group A \u03B2-haemolytic streptococci are the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis and penicillin remains the drug of choice. Patients suffering from otitis media and sinusitis are infected with the same organisms as those patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and antibacterial choices are therefore similar.","publish_time":"2012-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grossman, Ronald F.","journal":"Drug Investig","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d773bc05337aa4aeb0c4993dce74f7f750c25fa8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzUwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae","Moraxella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common illnesses","common hospital","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","antimicrobial agent","antimicrobial therapy","empirical therapy","diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia","additional common aetiological agents","atypical pathogens","likely pathogens","common cause of bacterial pharyngitis","Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis","predominant causative pathogens","aerobic Gram-negative species","frequent causative agent","Patients","significant mortality","Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli","Staphylococcus aureus","Legionella species","Haemophilus influenzae","Moraxella catarrhalis","cases of community","drug of choice","empirical basis","emergence of \u03B2","\u03B2-haemolytic streptococci","penicillin","antibacterial choices","sinusitis","lactamase","roentgenographic features","strains of","organisms","medical consultation","otitis media","Respiratory tract infections","specific information","New techniques","role"],"language":"en"},

While some VLP vaccines thrive and are readily adopted into the vaccination schedule, others are restrained by regulatory obstacles, proprietary limitations, or finding their niche amongst the crowded vaccine market. Often the necessity to supplant an existing vaccination regimen possesses an immediate obstacle for the development of a VLP vaccine, despite any preclinical advantages identified over the competition. Novelty, adaptability and formulation compatibility may prove invaluable in helping place VLP vaccines at the forefront of vaccination technology. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to outline the diversity of VLP vaccines, VLP-specific immune responses, and to explore how modern formulation and delivery techniques can enhance the clinical relevance and overall success of VLP vaccines. Expert commentary: The role of formation science, with an emphasis on the diversity of immune responses induced by VLP, is underrepresented amongst clinical trials for VLP vaccines.

While a fluid interface separates two fluids, membranes separate the inside of vesicles from the outside, the interior of biological cells from the environment, and compartmentalize cells into organelles. The physical properties of interfaces are characterized by interface tension, those of membranes are characterized by bending and stretching elasticity. Amphiphilic molecules like surfactants that are added to a system with two immiscible fluids decrease the interface tension and induce a bending rigidity. Lipid bilayer membranes of vesicles can be stretched or compressed by osmotic pressure; in biological cells, also the presence of a cytoskeleton can induce membrane tension. If the thickness of the interface or the membrane is small compared with its lateral extension, both can be described using two-dimensional mathematical surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space. We review recent work on the interaction of particles with interfaces and membranes. This can be micrometer-sized particles at interfaces that stabilise emulsions or form colloidosomes, as well as typically nanometer-sized particles at membranes, such as viruses, parasites, and engineered drug delivery systems. In both cases, we first discuss the interaction of single particles with interfaces and membranes, e.g. particles in external fields, non-spherical particles, and particles at curved interfaces, followed by interface-mediated interaction between two particles, many-particle interactions, interface and membrane curvature-induced phenomena, and applications.","publish_time":"2017-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dasgupta, S; Auth, T; Gompper, G","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff2bbf80b84a0148cf2e2f60176d40c6d87fdd0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104866/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of particles","interface tension","interaction of single particles","nanometer-sized particles","micrometer-sized particles","curved interfaces","fluid interface","non-spherical particles","interface-mediated interaction","membrane tension","physical properties of interfaces","Lipid bilayer membranes of vesicles","interior of biological cells","membrane curvature-induced phenomena","immiscible fluids","technological applications","inside of vesicles","bending rigidity","engineered drug delivery systems","parasites","external fields","outside","environment","viruses","emulsions","particle interactions","three-dimensional space","two-dimensional mathematical surfaces","presence","form colloidosomes","surfactants","biology","osmotic pressure","cytoskeleton","recent work","lateral extension","Amphiphilic molecules","organelles","thickness","cases","elasticity"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies of the capsid self-assembly involved solid objects of a supramolecular scale, e.g. corresponding to capsomeres, with engineered couplings and stochastic movements. In our approach, a single capsid is dissociated by an application of a high temperature for a variable period and then the system is cooled down to allow for self-assembly.

Following a burst of viral transcription in TG neurons, lytic cycle viral genes are suppressed and latency is established. The latency-associated transcript (LAT) is the only viral gene abundantly expressed during latency, and LAT expression is important for the latency-reactivation cycle. Reactivation from latency is required for virus transmission and recurrent disease, including encephalitis. The Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling pathway is differentially expressed in TG during the bovine herpesvirus 1 latency-reactivation cycle. Hence, we hypothesized HSV-1 regulates the Wnt/\u03B2-catenin pathway and promotes maintenance of latency because this pathway enhances neuronal survival and axonal repair. New studies revealed \u03B2-catenin was expressed in significantly more TG neurons during latency compared to TG from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant virus. When TG explants were incubated with media containing dexamethasone to stimulate reactivation, significantly fewer \u03B2-catenin\u002B TG neurons were detected. Conversely, TG explants from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant increased the number of \u03B2-catenin\u002B TG neurons in the presence of DEX relative to samples not treated with DEX. Impairing Wnt signaling with small molecule antagonists reduced virus shedding during explant-induced reactivation. These studies suggested \u03B2-catenin was differentially expressed during the latency-reactivation cycle, in part due to LAT expression.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrison, Kelly S.; Zhu, Liqian; Thunuguntla, Prasanth; Jones, Clinton","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e2b96e706a68f22c702c70ea98713dafe617b5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105109.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TG","DEX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TG neurons","latency-reactivation cycle","TG explants","maintenance of latency","\u03B2-catenin pathway","fewer \u03B2-catenin","latency-associated transcript","number of \u03B2","LAT expression","sensory neurons","uninfected mice","mutant virus","explant-induced reactivation","virus transmission","lytic cycle viral genes","Impairing Wnt","herpes simplex virus","HSV","burst of viral transcription","New studies","presence of DEX relative","oral cavity","trigeminal ganglia","small molecule antagonists","neuronal survival","bovine herpesvirus","ocular","nasal","axonal repair","recurrent disease","samples","dexamethasone","media","encephalitis","infection"],"language":"en"},

The current study was conducted to investigate the positive effects of dietary propolis (PR), as a potent naturally produced antioxidant, on growth performance and immune function of turkey poults exposed to oxidative stress induced by PQ injection. Native male turkey poults (n = 120, 49-d-old) were randomly assigned into 4 groups: poults received a basal diet with a daily subcutaneous PQ injection of 5 mg/kg BW for 7 consecutive days (PQ group), an experimental diet containing 1 g/kg PR with a daily subcutaneous PQ injection for 7 days (PR\u002BPQ group), or received the experimental PR diet with a daily subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL sterile saline for 7 days (PR group); while the control poults received a basal diet with a daily subcutaneous saline injection for 7 consecutive days (C group). The productive performance in the PQ group showed a significant (P \u003C 0.05) reduction in the weight gain (WG) and feed intake (FI), and impaired feed conversion ratio (FCR). Propolis supplementation in the PR\u002BPQ group significantly ameliorated the PQ effects on WG and FCR. Turkey poults of the PQ and PR\u002BPQ groups had a significant augmentation in the blood malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF\u03B1), and corticosterone levels, and in contrast, a significant reduction in the triiodothyronine (T(3)), when compared to the C group. While propolis significantly reduced the MDA and corticosterone, and increased the T(3) levels in the PR\u002BPQ group compared to the PQ group. Furthermore, the dietary PR supplementation significantly limited the PQ-suppressive effects on cell- and humoral-mediated immunity and lymphocyte proliferation of turkey poults. In addition, propolis supplementation in the PR and PR\u002BPQ groups markedly reversed the PQ-induced DNA fragmentation and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) over-expression in blood cells. It can be concluded that PR could improve turkey immunity and performance, particularly under inflammation and oxidative stress induced by PQ exposure.","publish_time":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abass, Ahmed O; Kamel, Nancy N; Khalifa, Walaa H; Gouda, G F; El-Manylawi, M A F; Mehaisen, Gamal M K; Mashaly, Magdi M","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e4e60ae746c62756181f4863dcc4b1a98d8c2e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PQ","PR PQ","FCR","MDA"],"locations":["Turkey"],"keyphrases":["PR group","PQ effects","PQ groups","PQ exposure","daily subcutaneous PQ injection","PQ-suppressive effects","experimental PR diet","dietary PR supplementation","PQ-induced DNA fragmentation","C group","daily subcutaneous injection","daily subcutaneous saline injection","turkey immunity","control poults","Propolis supplementation","lymphocyte proliferation of turkey poults","immune function of turkey poults","Native male turkey poults","basal diet","experimental diet","consecutive days","oxidative stress","significant reduction","positive effects of dietary propolis","growth performance","significant augmentation","WG","productive performance","MDA","FCR","corticosterone levels","sterile saline","feed intake","blood malondialdehyde","blood cells","humoral-mediated immunity","impaired feed conversion ratio","heat shock protein","Hsp70","TNF\u03B1","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","over-expression","inflammatory damage","inflammation","weight gain","agriculture","animal tissues","antioxidant","contrast","BW","triiodothyronine","herbicide","addition","d-old","current study","Paraquat"],"language":"en"},

Very little is known about the accuracy with which such alignment-free methods recover the correct phylogeny or about the potential for increasing their accuracy. We conducted a large-scale comparison of ten alignment-free methods, among them one new approach that does not calculate distances and a faster variant of our pattern-based approach; all distance-based alignment-free methods are freely available from http://www.bioinformatics.org.au (as Python package decaf\u002Bpy). We show that most methods exhibit a higher overall reconstruction accuracy in the presence of high among-site rate variation. Under all conditions that we considered, variants of the pattern-based approach were significantly better than the other alignment-free methods. The new pattern-based variant achieved a speed-up of an order of magnitude in the distance calculation step, accompanied by a small loss of tree reconstruction accuracy. A method of Bayesian inference from k-mers did not improve on classical alignment-free (and distance-based) methods but may still offer other advantages due to its Bayesian nature. We found the optimal word length k of word-based methods to be stable across various data sets, and we provide parameter ranges for two different alphabets. The influence of these alphabets was analyzed to reveal a trade-off in reconstruction accuracy between long and short branches. We have mapped the phylogenetic accuracy for many alignment-free methods, among them several recently introduced ones, and increased our understanding of their behavior in response to biologically important parameters. In all experiments, the pattern-based approach emerged as superior, at the expense of higher resource consumption. Nonetheless, no alignment-free method that we examined recovers the correct phylogeny as accurately as does an approach based on maximum-likelihood distance estimates of multiply aligned sequences.","publish_time":"2007-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00F6hl, Michael; Ragan, Mark A.","journal":"Syst Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f98da82fb35793a47922aa9251bb31ab826dd78a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107264.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distance-based alignment-free methods","pattern-based approach","classical alignment-free","multiple alignment","word-based methods","phylogenetic accuracy","new pattern-based variant","multiple sequence alignment","new approach","higher overall reconstruction accuracy","small loss of tree reconstruction accuracy","distance calculation step","molecular sequences","aligned sequences","correct phylogeny","maximum-likelihood distance estimates","method of Bayesian inference","faster variant","phylogenetic trees","different alphabets","Bayesian nature","expense of higher resource consumption","presence of high","various data sets","order of magnitude","speed-up","parameter ranges","behavior","response","optimal word length","mers","short branches","distances","trade-off","variants","Python package decaf","site rate variation","large-scale comparison","understanding","important parameters","process","advantages","potential","experiments","ones","conditions","influence"],"language":"en"},

Our results clearly demonstrate that the exposure of J774A.1 and primary macrophages to NDL-PCB 153 or 180 or all NDL-PCBs mixtures causes a significant reduction in LPS-induced cytokine/chemokine synthesis, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 and interleukin-6, together with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, involved in cell recruitment. Moreover, PCBs were found to suppress LPS-stimulated NO production, and to reduce cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in J774A.1 and primary macrophages. At mechanistic level, PCBs significantly counteract the LPS-driven toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and CD14 upregulation, therefore inhibiting downstream nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) activation in J774A.1. Furthermore, PCBs determine a significant loss of macrophage endocytic capacity, a prerequisite for efficient antigen presentation. Taken together, these data indicate that NDL-PCBs reduce macrophage responsiveness, particularly when they are combined at concentrations per se inactive, impairing the capability to orchestrate a proper immune response to an infectious stimulus, disrupting TLR4/NF-\u03BAB pathway.","publish_time":"2015-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santoro, Anna; Ferrante, Maria C.; Di Guida, Francesca; Pirozzi, Claudio; Lama, Adriano; Simeoli, Raffaele; Clausi, Maria T.; Monnolo, Anna; Mollica, Maria Pina; Mattace Raso, Giuseppina; Meli, Rosaria","journal":"Toxicol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af47270092a217d025dd17f45aad539f1dc6971e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NDL-PCBs mixtures","capability of NDL","primary macrophages","activated J774A","exposure of J774A","primary murine macrophages","LPS-induced cytokine","LPS-driven toll","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","NF-\u03BAB pathway","proper immune response","immune system","significant reduction","macrophage responsiveness","significant loss of macrophage endocytic capacity","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","chemokine synthesis","prerequisite","infectious stimulus","inducible nitric oxide synthase expression","interleukin","interference","receptor","TLR4","polychlorinated biphenyls","lipopolysaccharide","persistent organic pollutants","range of adverse health effects","efficient antigen presentation","cyclooxygenase","CD14 upregulation","activation","indicators","se inactive","monocyte chemoattractant protein","Non-dioxin","mechanistic level","concentrations","production","data","cell recruitment","results","study"],"language":"en"},

So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet \u002B 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet \u002B 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet \u002B 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine significantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P \u003C 0.05). Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (TNF-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3, and IL-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of IL-2 and IFN-\u03B3 in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P \u003C 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.","publish_time":"2018-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saeed, Muhammad; Yatao, Xu; Tiantian, Zhang; Qian, Ren; Chao, Sun","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1db02ff76c1ebaa9aa5ed0a472c069f81174b77b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107316.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["theanine","basal diet","d of age","jejunum microbiome","ileum","control group","jejunum of broiler chicken","population of Lactobacillus","treatment groups","d-old chicks","green tea","intestinal microbiome","IFN-\u03B3","expression of IL","effects","results","study","beneficial microbes","intestinal bacteria","harmful microbes","higher population","immune response","mRNA expression of TLRs","V4 hypervariable regions","amplification of V3","studies","feed additive","S ribosomal RNA","availability of abundant literature","positive influence","cytokines","TNF-\u03B1","intestine","amino acid","use","dietary supplementation","Mucosal samples","negative correlation of abundance","finding","Extraction of genomic DNA","poultry","complete randomized design","Clostridium","Illumina sequencing","overall diversity","summary","total","Treatments"],"language":"en"},

Current farm management practices perpetuate persistent infestations contributing to the dispersal of beetles and pathogens. To study the dissemination of bacteria by this beetle, we require the ability to differentiate internal from external sources of bacteria carried by the beetle. In this study, we tested previously described methods to externally disinfect beetles and found disinfectant efficacies between 40 and 98%. The irregular surface of the insect posed a challenge to cleansing procedures because the surface offered many recesses able to sequester bacteria.

Here, to test the evolutionary history of PRRSV speculated by the epidemiological background, we estimated the divergence time and evolutionary rate of PRRSV with molecular evolutionary analysis. Estimated divergence time (1972\u20131988) corresponded well to that estimated by the epidemiological data, and the evolutionary rate (4.71\u20139.8) \u00D7 10(\u22122) of PRRSV was indeed the highest among RNA viruses so far reported. Furthermore, we inferred important sites for the adaptation in order to examine how PRRSV have adapted to swine since they emerged. The adaptive sites were located not only in the epitopes related to immunity but also in the transmembrane regions including a signal peptide. In particular, the adaptive sites in the transmembrane regions were considered to affect compatibility to the host cell membrane. We conclude that PRRSV were transmitted from another host species to swine in about 1980 and have adapted to swine by altering the transmembrane regions.","publish_time":"2005-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanada, Kousuke; Suzuki, Yoshiyuki; Nakane, Takashi; Hirose, Osamu; Gojobori, Takashi","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f1c9c46e192d9d3f44a4ff600ca724196ce515f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107557.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolutionary rate of PRRSV","evolutionary history of PRRSV","Estimated divergence time","higher evolutionary rate","transmembrane regions","swine","RNA viruses","adaptive sites","epidemiological data","molecular evolutionary analysis","order","epidemiological background","important sites","year","respiratory syndrome viruses","host species","European types","host cell membrane","compatibility","adaptation","difference","amino acid sequences","immunity","signal peptide","epitopes"],"language":"en"},

Methods. All inpatients who had stayed in the same ward as the initial index case patient for any duration before isolation were recruited into a cohort and followed up to document the occurrence of SARS. The normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols at different locations of the ward was estimated by use of computational fluid dynamics modeling. The attack rates in the various subgroups stratified by bed location were calculated. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to document important risk factors. Results. The overall attack rate of SARS was 41% (30 of 74 subjects). It was 65%, 52%, and 18% in the same bay, adjacent bay, and distant bays, respectively (P = .001). Computation fluid dynamics modeling indicated that the normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols was highest in the same bay and lowest in the distant bays. Cox regression indicated that staying in the ward on 6 or 10 March entailed higher risk, as well as staying in the same or adjacent bays. The epidemic curve showed 2 peaks, and stratified analyses by bed location suggested \u003E1 generation of spread. Conclusions. The temporal-spatial spread of SARS in the ward was consistent with airborne transmission, as modeled by use of computational fluid dynamics.

During the outbreak of the emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection, \u003E30% of the \u223C8000 infected persons were health care workers. The highly infectious nature of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) compelled our pathologists to consider biosafety issues in the autopsy room and for tissue processing procedures. Methods. A specially designed biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy laboratory was constructed and divided into a clean area, a semicontaminated area, a contaminated area, and 2 buffer zones. High-efficiency particulate air filters were placed in the air supply and exhaust systems. Laminar air flow was from the clean areas to the less clean areas. The negative pressures of the contaminated, semicontaminated, and clean areas were approximately -50 pa, -25 pa, and -5 pa, respectively. Personal protective equipment, including gas mask, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves worn during autopsies; the equipment was decontaminated before it was allowed to exit the facility. Strict BSL-3 practices were followed. Results. When a given concentration of particulate sarin simulant was introduced into the contaminated area, it could not be detected in either the semicontaminated area or clean area, and particles \u003E0.3 \u03BCm in size were not detected in the exhaust air.

Previous studies have shown associations between low mannose-binding lectin (MBL) level or variant MBL2 genotype and sepsis susceptibility. However, MBL deficiency has not been rigorously defined, and associations with sepsis outcomes have not been subjected to multivariable analysis. Methods. We reanalyzed MBL results in a large cohort with use of individual data from 4 studies involving a total of 1642 healthy control subjects and systematically defined a reliable deficiency cutoff. Subsequently, data were reassessed to extend previous MBL and sepsis associations, with adjustment for known outcome predictors. We reanalyzed individual data from 675 patients from 5 adult studies and 1 pediatric study of MBL and severe bacterial infection. Results. XA/O and O/O MBL2 genotypes had the lowest median MBL concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that an MBL cutoff value of 0.5 \u226Ag/mL was a reliable predictor of low-producing MBL2 genotypes (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 82%; negative predictive value, 98%). MBL deficiency was associated with increased likelihood of death among patients with severe bacterial infection (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.30\u20133.43). In intensive care unit\u2013based studies, there was a trend toward increased risk of death among MBL-deficient patients (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.90\u20132.77) after adjustment for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Enquiry II score. The risk of death was increased among MBL-deficient patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (odds ratio, 5.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.27\u201324.92) after adjustment for bacteremia, comorbidities, and age. Conclusions. We defined a serum level for MBL deficiency that can be used with confidence in future studies of MBL disease associations. The risk of death was increased among MBL-deficient patients with severe pneumococcal infection, highlighting the pathogenic significance of this innate immune defence protein.","publish_time":"2008-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eisen, Damon P.; Dean, Melinda M.; Boermeester, Marja A.; Fidler, Katy J.; Gordon, Anthony C.; Kronborg, Gitte; Kun, J\u00FCrgen F.

Pneumonia is recognized as a leading cause of morbidity in seniors. However, the overall burden of this disease\u2014and, in particular, the contribution of ambulatory cases to that burden\u2014is not well defined. To estimate rates of community-acquired pneumonia and to identify risk factors for this disease, we conducted a large, population-based cohort study of persons aged \u2A7E65 years that included both hospitalizations and outpatient visits for pneumonia. Methods. The study population consisted of 46,237 seniors enrolled at Group Health Cooperative who were observed over a 3-year period. Pneumonia episodes presumptively identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes assigned to medical encounters were validated by medical record review. Characteristics of participants were defined by administrative data sources. Results. The overall rate of community-acquired pneumonia ranged from 18.2 cases per 1000 person-years among persons aged 65\u201369 years to 52.3 cases per 1000 person-years among those aged \u2A7E85 years. In this population, 59.3% of all pneumonia episodes were treated on an outpatient basis. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia included age, male sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and smoking. Conclusions. On the basis of these data, we estimate that roughly 915,900 cases of community-acquired pneumonia occur annually among seniors in the United States and that \u223C1 of every 20 persons aged \u2A7E85 years will have a new episode of community-acquired pneumonia each year.","publish_time":"2004-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, Michael L.; Neuzil, Kathleen M.; Thompson, William W.; Shay, David K.; Yu, Onchee; Hanson, Christi A.; Jackson, Lisa A.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67e759d0f3f6c4b392b7c5ed525fdad6fb19692e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108010.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108010/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group Health Cooperative"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Pneumonia episodes","cases of community","person-years","seniors","rates of community","overall rate of community","study population","new episode of community","risk factors","population-based cohort study of persons","contribution of ambulatory cases","overall burden","outpatient basis","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","medical encounters","outpatient visits","year period","medical record review","administrative data sources","asthma","diabetes mellitus","male sex","Revision","age","congestive heart failure","Clinical Modification codes","International Classification of Diseases","multivariate analysis","hospitalizations","leading cause of morbidity","smoking","Characteristics of participants","Group Health Cooperative","United States","Methods","Results","Conclusions","Background"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied weekly death due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in autopsies conducted in 1993 to 2000 in St Petersburg, Russia. We plotted the weekly acute respiratory disease (ARD) counts and influenza epidemics against AMI and chronic IHD deaths. There were 11 892 subjects dying of AMI and 23 000 subjects dying of chronic IHD. Median age was 75 for women and 65 for men. In every year, a peak of AMI and chronic IHD deaths were present and coincided with the influenza epidemic and peak ARD activity. A similar pattern was seen for each subgroup of men, women, subjects 50 years or older, and subjects 70 years or older. When comparing the average influenza epidemic weeks to average off-season weeks, the odds for AMI and chronic IHD death increased by 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08\u20131.56) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97\u20131.26), respectively.

Because of this compartmental separation, Brefeldin A treatment has been used to map the sub-Golgi locations of several Golgi enzymes including GM2 synthase. We previously proposed that GM2 synthase might be located in a distal portion of the Golgi complex which in the presence of Brefeldin A would be separated from the substrate ganglioside GM3 present in the mixed ER-Golgi membrane system. In the present study we show using GM2 synthase chimeras that GM2 synthesis was blocked by Brefeldin A when GM2 synthase was distributed throughout all Golgi subcompartments or even when it was restricted to the medial Golgi. Because these findings opposed our speculation regarding a distal location of this enzyme, we sought an alternative explanation for the inhibition of ganglioside synthesis by Brefeldin A. However, Brefeldin A did not degrade GM2 synthase, prevent its homodimerization, or inhibit its in vitro activity. Brefeldin A did result in the conversion of a portion of membrane bound GM2 synthase into a soluble form which has minimal capability to produce GM2 in whole cells. However, this conversion was not sufficient to explain the nearly total loss of GM2 production in intact cells in the presence of Brefeldin A. Nevertheless, the results of this study indicate that Brefeldin A-induced inhibition of ganglioside synthesis cannot be used to deduce the location of GM2 synthase.","publish_time":"1999-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Young, William W.; Allende, Maria Laura; Jaskiewicz, Ewa","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/662df200b97c40499541945ec265a98a84820e88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Brefeldin","Brefeldin A."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GM2 synthesis","location of GM2 synthase","GM2 synthase chimeras","Golgi complex","presence of Brefeldin","Golgi enzymes","Golgi cisternae","Golgi locations","Golgi subcompartments","medial Golgi","portion of membrane bound GM2 synthase","trans Golgi network","mixed ER-Golgi membrane system","total loss of GM2 production","induced inhibition of ganglioside synthesis","distal portion","present study","distal location","conversion","substrate ganglioside GM3 present","separate endosomal membrane system","intact cells","soluble form","alternative explanation","minimal capability","mixing","speculation","compartmental separation","treatment","homodimerization","results","findings","activity"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Seventy subjects with UC (mean age 13 years, 45 had moderate symptoms, 25 had severe, 69 of 70 had a Mayo endoscopy subscore 2/3) were studied. We detected a wide range of animal viruses that were taxonomically classified into 12 viral families. A virus was present in 50% of fecal samples collected at presentation, 41% of samples collected after remission, and 40% of samples in our control group. The most frequently identified viruses were diet-based gyroviruses. The UC cohort had a significantly higher prevalence of anelloviruses compared with the control cohort.

Despite the relatively small numbers used in the laboratory, ferrets have some unique applications including study of human influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated corona virus. They have served as models for peptic ulcer disease, carotenoid metabolism, cystic fibrosis, and drug emesis screening, among others. Most research ferrets are males, due to estrus-related health problems in females. They may be housed conventionally and are easy to care for when their biology and behavior are understood. Due to the small number of ferret suppliers, animals are often shipped long distances, requiring air transport and intermediate handlers. It is important to minimize shipment stress, especially with weanling and pregnant animals. Additional expertise is required for success with pregnant and whelping ferrets and for rearing of neonates. The animals have specific dietary requirements, and proper nutrition is key. Successful housing requires knowledge of ferret behaviors including social behavior, eating habits, a general inquisitive nature, and a species-typical need to burrow and hide. Regular handling is necessary to maintain well-being. A ferret health care program consists of physical examination, immunization, clinical pathology, and a working knowledge of common ferret diseases.

Not surprisingly, relationships between airports vary widely, due to a myriad of geographic, economic, political and historical determinants. Further, given the dynamic nature of the many influences acting on the air transportation system, inter-airport relationships and the structure of the global air network as a whole are also constantly changing. The purpose of this paper is to explore such spatio-temporal variations in the structure of the global airport hierarchies. Here, we show how the concept of nodal regions can be applied to measure the extent of these variations. To facilitate this analysis, a database of nearly 900 airline carrier schedules and 4650 worldwide origins and destinations, representing a nearly complete record of commercial air travel over a six-year period, is examined. Given this dataset, nodal regions are derived for all airports represented. In general, results suggest that regions associated with individual airports are often relatively dynamic at the yearly as well as quarterly level. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is utilized as a local case-study to provide a detailed examination of these dynamics.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grubesic, Tony H.; Matisziw, Timothy C.; Zook, Matthew A.","journal":"Journal of Transport Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/813dc94ade8514c13e8db24d686f8a976c8a62ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126044.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692309000167; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966692309000167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288372/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2009.02.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Los Angeles International Airport"],"keyphrases":["global air network","global air transportation network","air transportation system","global airport hierarchies","structure","inter-airport relationships","concept of nodal regions","individual airports","Los Angeles International Airport","complete record of commercial air travel","international passengers","year period","dynamic nature","spatio-temporal variations","millions of domestic","airline carrier schedules","worldwide origins","destinations","influences","database","detailed examination","myriad of geographic","historical determinants","local case-study","yearly","results","quarterly level","paper","dynamics","dataset","purpose","analysis","extent"],"language":"en"},

Since the emergence of new coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses in humans (e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Nipah virus), numerous studies clearly established that bats can maintain some of these viruses. Improving our understanding on the role of bats in the epidemiology of the pathogens they harbour is necessary to prevent cross-species spill over along the wild/domestic/human gradient. In this study, we screened bat faecal samples for the presence of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus in two caves frequently visited by local people to collect manure and/or to hunt bats in Zimbabwe. We amplified partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of Alpha and Betacoronavirus together with the partial polymerase gene of Paramyxovirus. Identified coronaviruses were related to pathogenic human strains and the paramyxovirus belonged to the recently described Jeilongvirus genus. Our results highlighted the importance of monitoring virus circulation in wildlife, especially bats, in the context of intense human-wildlife interfaces in order to strengthen prevention measures among local populations and to implement sentinel surveillance in sites with high zoonotic diseases transmission potential.","publish_time":"2018-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bourgarel, Mathieu; Pfukenyi, Davies M.; Bou\u00E9, Vanina; Talignani, Lo\u00EFc; Chiweshe, Ngoni; Diop, Fod\u00E9; Caron, Alexandre; Matope, Gift; Miss\u00E9, Doroth\u00E9e; Li\u00E9geois, Florian","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcd7c3d2ce33be6e7b570201638abf7ed9e99b03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106086.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29331670/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818300078; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818300078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of bats","human health","human gradient","partial polymerase gene of Paramyxovirus","pathogenic human strains","context of intense human-wildlife interfaces","partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of Alpha","high-impact","Nipah virus","presence of Coronavirus","local populations","great diversity of zoonotic viruses","local people","high zoonotic diseases transmission potential","emergence of new coronaviruses","importance of monitoring virus circulation","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","humans","SARS-CoV","sites","order","Betacoronavirus","sentinel surveillance","paramyxoviruses","prevention measures","bat faecal samples","numerous studies","caves","study","results","livestock","pathogens","epidemiology","manure","cross-species","understanding","Jeilongvirus genus","Zimbabwe"],"language":"en"},

International and domestic guidelines for wastewater reuse stipulate that virus infection risks are to be regulated by the multiple-barrier system, in which a wastewater treatment process composed of sequential treatment units is designed based on the pre-determined virus removal efficiency of each unit. The objectives of this review were to calculate representative values of virus removal efficiency in wastewater treatment units based on published datasets, and to identify research topics that should be further addressed for improving implementation of the multiple-barrier system. The removal efficiencies of human noroviruses, rotaviruses and enteroviruses in membrane bioreactor (MBR) and conventional activated sludge (CAS) processes were obtained by a systematic review protocol and a meta-analysis approach. The log(10) reduction (LR) of norovirus GII and enterovirus in MBR were 3.35 (95% confidence interval: 2.39, 4.30) and 2.71 (1.52, 3.89), respectively. The LR values of rotavirus, norovirus GI and GII in CAS processes were 0.87 (0.20, 1.53), 1.48 (0.96, 2.00) and 1.35 (0.52, 2.18), respectively. The systematic review process eliminated a substantial number of articles about virus removal in wastewater treatment because of the lack of information required for the meta-analysis.

Adding the sixth member of the galectin family in chicken, a model organism for systematic profiling of these adhesion/growth-regulatory proteins, is a step toward comprehensive network monitoring. METHODS: Database mining and computational data processing are applied for gene detection, chromosomal location and sequence alignments. Cloning, recombinant production and fusion-protein technology gain access to the protein, mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis/filtration provide analytical data. Haemagglutination, glycan microarray and cell assays assess binding capacity, and crystallography of a shortened variant (also analyzed by ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering) determines its structure. RESULTS: The gene for the galectin-related protein (GRP) is present exclusively in vertebrates with high-level sequence conservation and similar chromosomal positioning. The chicken protein is monomeric and has lost the canonical galectin property of binding lactose. The crystal structure of the variant without the 36-amino-acid extension at the start provides explanations for this lack of binding. CONCLUSIONS: Chicken GRP is special within this family of six proteins by being unable to bind lactose. The documented high degree of sequence conservation among vertebrate orthologues confers the status of a model for delineating an assumedly shared functionality to this GRP. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Biochemical characterization of a product of a gene under strong positive selection is a prerequisite for functional characterization. It is also essential for network monitoring by adding a new member to this lectin family.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa Caballero, Gabriel; Flores-Ibarra, Andrea; Michalak, Malwina; Khasbiullina, Nailya; Bovin, Nicolai V.; Andr\u00E9, Sabine; Manning, Joachim C.; V\u00E9rtesy, Sabine; Ruiz, Federico M.; Kaltner, Herbert; Kopitz, J\u00FCrgen; Romero, Antonio; Gabius, Hans-Joachim","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a1a59edc00abf3619a83974d66e94abdafbbe84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127388.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416516302057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304416516302057; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27268118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chicken protein","galectin family","Chicken GRP","galectin-related protein","high-level sequence conservation","gene detection","sequence alignments","binding capacity","canonical galectin property of binding lactose","lack of binding","comprehensive network monitoring","fusion-protein technology gain access","documented high degree of sequence conservation","cell assays","model organism","cell physiology","analytical data","chromosomal location","new member","Biochemical characterization","functional characterization","shortened variant","crystal structure","computational data processing","similar chromosomal positioning","growth-regulatory proteins","gel electrophoresis","mass spectrometry","ultracentrifugation","multifunctional effectors","adhesion","filtration","vertebrate orthologues","vertebrates","strong positive selection","Endogenous lectins","systematic profiling","recombinant production","glycan microarray","start","prerequisite","Database mining","explanations","crystallography","step","small angle X-ray scattering","BACKGROUND","amino-acid extension","METHODS","Haemagglutination","status","GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE","Cloning","shared functionality","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Nucleolin recognized with high affinity and specificity the majority, but not all the possible G-quadruplexes folded by this sequence. In addition, it displayed greater binding preference towards DNA than RNA G-quadruplexes, thus indicating two levels of selectivity based on the sequence and nature of the target. The interaction translated into stabilization of the LTR G-quadruplexes and increased promoter silencing activity; in contrast, disruption of nucleolin binding in cells by both siRNAs and a nucleolin binding aptamer greatly increased LTR promoter activity.

An easy and time-saving method is the preparation of ORS in milk. As milk-based ORS are hypertonic solutions administration of them may trigger thirst. Therefore, we hypothesized that restrictively fed calves receiving ORS prepared in milk had a higher water intake than restrictively and ad libitum fed calves receiving ORS prepared in water during diarrheic episodes. The daily water intake was measured in 100 individually-housed Holstein Friesian calves from day 2 to 21 of life. One group of the calves was fed with restrictive amounts of milk, the other group got milk ad libitum by an automated milk feeder. Nearly all calves spontaneously developed diarrhea within the observation period from day 2 to 21 of life. In cases of diarrhea the restrictively-fed calves received ORS prepared in milk or ORS prepared in water two hours after their milk meal, whereas the ad libitum-fed calves only got ORS prepared in water. All calves had ad libitum access to water. The daily intake of water, milk, and ORS and weight gain during diarrheic episode were determined. Data were expressed as arithmetic means (\u00B1standard deviation) and analyzed by using a one-way ANOVA or repeated-measures ANOVA. From day 2 to 21 of life calves fed with restrictive amounts of milk had higher water intakes related to the total dry matter intake (DMI) with 1.6 L/kg of total DMI than ad libitum-fed calves (0.9 L/kg of total DMI) per day. In cases of diarrhea water intake increased in all feeding groups. The calves receiving milk-based ORS had the highest water intake with 1.7 L/d during the period of diarrhea compared to the calves received ORS prepared in water. Moreover, the calves fed ORS in milk showed with 4.6 L/d the highest daily ORS intake. There were no differences in the duration of diarrhea or the daily weight gain during period of diarrhea between the feeding regimens. Therefore, it can be concluded that all feeding regimens were suitable in the treatment of calf diarrhea. The simplest method to treat calves suffering from diarrhea is the preparation of ORS in milk, but then ad libitum availability of water is absolutely necessary. Moreover, calves drink considerable amounts of water within the first 3 weeks of life and therefore should be provided with water for animal welfare reasons.","publish_time":"2013-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wenge, J.; Steinh\u00F6fel, I.; Heinrich, C.; Coenen, M.; Bachmann, L.","journal":"Livest Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86aa49fbf316ed40cb899e8a5896198868efc834.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185482.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2013.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362953/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871141313004976; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141313004976","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORS","DMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["milk-based ORS","life calves","Diarrheic calves","milk ad libitum","daily water intake","daily intake of water","milk replacer","milk meal","preparation of ORS","cases of diarrhea water intake","highest water intake","ad libitum availability of water","highest daily ORS intake","restrictive amounts of milk","considerable amounts of water","automated milk feeder","higher water intakes","period of diarrhea","housed Holstein Friesian calves","duration of diarrhea","ad libitum access","day","treatment of calf diarrhea","total dry matter intake","total DMI","daily weight gain","feeding regimens","weeks of life","observation period","feeding groups","diarrheic episodes","one-way ANOVA","simplest method","oral rehydration solutions","hypertonic solutions administration","repeated-measures ANOVA","arithmetic means","energy","hours","standard deviation","time","animal welfare reasons","electrolyte supply","Data","thirst","differences"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies have demonstrated that a minimum of 31% of adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients and 18% of adults with leukemia who are hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness have a community respiratory virus infection. The temporal occurrence of these infections in immunocompromised patients tends to mirror their occurrence in the community. The clinical illnesses range from self-limited upper respiratory illnesses to fatal pneumonias, depending on the type of virus and the type and degree of immunosuppression. The pneumonias may be viral, bacterial/fungal, or mixed. The highest frequency of progression to fatal viral pneumonia has been reported for RSV infections in recently transplanted BMT recipients and myelosuppressed patients with leukemia. Studies have suggested that early therapy for RSV pneumonia with a combination of aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin may be of benefit. Defining effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies will be a challenge, given the diversity of viruses, the wide spectrum of immunocompromised patients with varying vulnerability to serious community respiratory virus disease, and the frequent presence of other opportunistic infections and medical problems. A combination of antiviral drugs and immunotherapy may need to be considered for their potential additive effect as well as to prevent the emergence of resistant virus, as occurs during monotherapy for influenza with amantadine or rimantadine. The optimal therapies need to be defined in controlled trials; however, it appears that a favorable response will hinge on the initiation of therapy at an early stage of the respiratory illness.","publish_time":"1997-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whimbey, MD Estella; Englund, MD Janet A.; Couch, MD Robert B.","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e730c9ec430fdb1c9955e1359ac359e7b129965e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172994.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934397800046; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934397800046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMT","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial virus","community respiratory virus infection","Abstract Community respiratory viruses","serious community respiratory virus disease","acute respiratory illness","type of virus","self-limited upper respiratory illnesses","important cause of respiratory disease","RSV infections","RSV pneumonia","parainfluenza viruses","immunocompromised adult","diversity of viruses","emergence of resistant virus","wide spectrum of immunocompromised patients","fatal viral pneumonia","myelosuppressed patients","opportunistic infections","fatal pneumonias","early therapy","leukemia","transplanted BMT recipients","clinical illnesses","early stage","initiation of therapy","temporal occurrence","Recent studies","combination of aerosolized ribavirin","combination of antiviral drugs","adult bone marrow transplant","varying vulnerability","frequent presence","intravenous immunoglobulin","picornaviruses","monotherapy","adenoviruses","highest frequency of progression","therapeutic strategies","challenge","minimum","medical problems","immunotherapy","amantadine","rimantadine","cancer","degree of immunosuppression","potential additive effect","favorable response","benefit","adults","optimal therapies","controlled trials"],"language":"en"},

Here we report on another zoonotic pathogen, H7 influenza, and provide an update on the implementation of Supramap as a web service. We find that the emergence of pathogenic strains of H7 is labile with many transitions from high to low pathogenicity, and from low to high pathogenicity. We use Supramap to put these events in a temporal and geospatial context. We identify several lineages of H7 influenza with biomarkers of high pathogenicity in regions that have not been reported in the scientific literature. The original implementation of Supramap was built with tightly coupled client and server software. Now we have decoupled the components to provide a modular web service for POY (http://poyws.org) that can be consumed by a data provider to create a novel application. To demonstrate the web service, we have produced an application, Geogenes (http://geogenes.org). Unlike in Supramap, in which the user is required to create and upload data files, in Geogenes the user works from a graphical interface to query an underlying dataset.

In this paper, the association between two network analysis measures, i.e. \u2018in-degree\u2019 and \u2018ingoing infection chain\u2019, and signs of infection is investigated. It is shown that based on regression analysis of combined data from a recent cross-sectional study for endemic viral infections and network analysis of animal movements, a positive serological result for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is significantly associated with the purchase of animals. For BCV, this association was significant also when accounting for herd size and regional cattle density, but not for BRSV. Examples are given for different approaches to include cattle movement data in risk-based surveillance by selecting herds based on network analysis measures. Results show that compared to completely random sampling these approaches increase the number of detected positives, both for BCV and BRSV in our study population. It is concluded that network measures for the relevant time period based on updated databases of animal movements can provide a simple and straight forward tool for risk-based sampling.","publish_time":"2012-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fr\u00F6ssling, Jenny; Ohlson, Anna; Bj\u00F6rkman, Camilla; H\u00E5kansson, Nina; N\u00F6remark, Maria","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb2c5a27759bb6fa552df0338e7a0becf0e1bda5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114171.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587711003990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265643/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.12.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587711003990","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk-based surveillance","network analysis measures","risk-based sampling","network measures","risk-based approach","network analysis of animal movements","BCV","BRSV","aim of surveillance","surveillance system","disease surveillance programmes","regression analysis of combined data","association","cattle movement data","bovine coronavirus","updated databases of animal movements","different approaches","disease detection","study population","number of samples","random sampling","signs of infection","recent cross-sectional study","identification of case herds","regional cattle density","number of detected positives","ingoing infection chain","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","endemic viral infections","positive serological result","relevant time period","herd size","accounting","straight forward tool","degree","sensitivity","Abstract Financial resources","Examples","paper","purchase of animals","Results"],"language":"en"},

The main objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and the characteristics of HAdV infection in Korean allogeneic HCT recipients (\u003C19 years). METHODS: In a prospective study from April 2012 to September 2015, HAdV in blood, urine, and stool specimens were monitored weekly from transplantation to day 100 or after if clinically suspected. HAdV infection was defined as positive HAdV PCR result in any specimens regardless of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 1734 specimens were collected from 57 consecutively enrolled recipients. The cumulative incidence of HAdV infection at day 100, and 1 year was 10%, and 20%, and the incidence of viremia was 2% and 6%, respectively. The median onset time from HCT to viremia was 221 days (range, 7\u2010596 days). All viremia cases were caused by only HAdV 3 (species B), whereas several types were detected in stool. Among patients with HAdV infection, lower absolute lymphocyte counts and extensive chronic graft\u2010vs\u2010host disease were associated with viremia (P = .028 and P = .006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to western studies, this study demonstrated a lower incidence and delayed onset of HAdV infections and HAdV 3 was most prevalent in Korea.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Ji\u2010Man; Park, Ki\u2010Sup; Kim, Jong Min; Huh, Hee Jae; Ki, Chang\u2010Seok; Lee, Nam Yong; Yoo, Keon Hee; Sung, Ki Woong; Koo, Hong\u2010Hoe; Kim, Yae\u2010Jean","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20980a79e249fc19586c466e3289ee8a9636a0c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169713.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569813/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["characteristics of HAdV infection","cumulative incidence of HAdV infection","delayed onset of HAdV infections","positive HAdV PCR result","incidence of viremia","lower incidence","stool specimens","viremia cases","Korean allogeneic HCT recipients","enrolled recipients","prospective study","days","allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation","western studies","species C","species B","lower absolute lymphocyte","median onset time","Epidemiologic studies of human adenovirus","extensive chronic graft","host disease","vs","BACKGROUND","European countries","blood","urine","patients","epidemiology","types","range","years","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","main objective","RESULTS","total","symptoms","community"],"language":"en"},

Abstract We review the microbiological aspects of COVID-19 infection and present the microbiological studies that should be performed in forensic cases. We describe the taxonomic characteristics of the virus, its relationship with the coronaviridae family and its genetic structure. We briefly present the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 infection, as well as the co-infections that could be associated with this virus. In the laboratory, PCR is a first-choice technique in the acute phase of the infection, together with antigen and serological studies. Finally, we describe the main objectives of microbiological studies in the deceased in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the main post-mortem microbiological analysis to be carried out in the medico-legal context. The microbiological analysis should aim to detect both SARS-CoV-2 and coinfections, which may also contribute to the cause of death.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fern\u00E1ndez-Rodr\u00EDguez, Amparo; Casas, Inmaculada; Culebras, Esther; Morilla, Elena; Cohen, Marta C.; Alberola, Juan","journal":"Revista Espa\u00F1ola de Medicina Legal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c78098d15190d819f056718660a9265d4073690d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reml.2020.05.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377473220300304?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377473220300304","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["realizar en fallecidos en","elecci\u00F3n en","y se presentan","infecci\u00F3n COVID","los estudios antig\u00E9nicos y los serol\u00F3gicos","Finalmente se detallan los principales objetivos para los estudios microbiol\u00F3gicos en fallecidos en relaci\u00F3n","se analizan","laboratorio se","microbiological aspects of COVID","Resumen En este art\u00EDculo se revisan los aspectos microbiol\u00F3gicos","En primer lugar","y se describen los principales an\u00E1lisis microbiol\u00F3gicos post- m\u00F3rtem","pandemia COVID","Se presentan brevemente","este virus","pathological characteristics of COVID","recomendaciones sobre los an\u00E1lisis que deben realizarse en casos forenses","Los estudios microbiol\u00F3gicos deben estar dirigidos tanto","main objectives of microbiological studies","main post-mortem microbiological analysis","caracter\u00EDsticas cl\u00EDnicas y patol\u00F3gicas","su relaci\u00F3n","familia coronaviridae y su estructura gen\u00E9tica","PCR","SARS-CoV","serological studies","coinfecciones que pueden asociarse","caracter\u00EDsticas taxon\u00F3micas","que tambi\u00E9n podr\u00EDan contribuir","as\u00ED como","coronaviridae family","taxonomic characteristics","t\u00E9cnica","fase aguda","detecci\u00F3n","causa","deceased","\u00E1mbito forense","choice technique","acute phase","relationship","diagn\u00F3stico","muerte","genetic structure","antigen","pandemic","medico-legal context","coinfections","forensic cases","co-infections","cause of death","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a non-permissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus. The involvement of macrophages in natural resistance to these viruses is discussed in relation to other putative resistance determinants like interferon production and sensitivity and natural killer cell activity.","publish_time":"1985-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mogensen, S\u00F8ren C.","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8f3d040369c9ad46e10e4d430986e1f17aa8a7e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165247885901713; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165247885901713","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["natural resistance","determined resistance","virus infections","influenza virus","genetics of resistance","ability of macrophages","role of macrophages","involvement of macrophages","Abstract Macrophages","herpes simplex virus","mouse hepatitis virus","putative resistance determinants","viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication","Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages","body\u0027s natural defense","susceptibility","natural killer cell activity","determined variation","dissemination of viruses","studies","viral infections","susceptible cells","surrounding cells","intact animal","classical examples","animal models","sensitivity","interferon production","flaviviruses","congenic strains","finding","invasion","availability of numerous inbred","non-permissive barrier","important element","animals","relation","interesting aspect","cellular level","monogenic traits","mice"],"language":"en"},

Compared to controls, the whole group of FIP-affected cats had blood changes consistent with FIP. Based on the pathological findings or on the immunohistochemical distribution of viral antigen, FIP-affected cats were divided in the following groups: subacute against acute lesions; low against strong intensity of positivity; intracellular against extracellular positivities; positive against negative lymph nodes. Lymphopenia was more evident in cats with acute forms, strong intensity of positivity, extracellular antigen and negative lymph nodes.

Both viruses establish an infection in porcine enterocytes in the small intestine, and their spike (S) proteins play a key role in the virus-cell binding process under unfavorable conditions when the intestine with a low pH is filled with a thick layer of mucus and proteases.

In this study, we employed real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze the cis-acting elements on bovine coronavirus (BCoV) sgmRNA 7 required for the synthesis of its (\u2212)-strand counterpart by deletion mutagenesis. The major findings are as follows. (1) Deletion of the 5\u0027-terminal leader sequence on sgmRNA 7 decreased the synthesis of the (\u2212)-strand sgmRNA complement. (2) Deletions of the 3\u0027 untranslated region (UTR) bulged stem-loop showed no effect on (\u2212)-strand sgmRNA synthesis; however, deletion of the 3\u0027 UTR pseudoknot decreased the yield of (\u2212)-strand sgmRNA.

To detect and study the evolution of PEDV and PDCoV in central China (Shanxi, Henan, Hubei province), 70 clinical intestinal and fecal samples from piglets with severe watery diarrhea during August 2015 and June 2016 were collected, tested and analyzed. PEDV was more frequently detected by PCR than PDCoV. Phylogenetic analysis of S genes showed that the 10 PEDV strains from this study clustered into G2a (n = 7) and G2b (n = 3) groups. Additionally, the three G2b strains (PEDV S2\u25B3) contained the same specific 3 nt deletion in S2 as other reference strains in G2b. Interestingly, complete genome analysis indicated that CH/hubei/2016 was closer to the US INDEL strain and G2a group. CH/hubei/2016 had one recombination event in S2 gene which may have resulted from AH2012-12 (from G2b group) and CH-ZMDZY-11 (from G2a group). Furthermore, 10 purifying selection sites in S gene indicated an adaptive evolution of PEDV in central China swine herds. These results suggested that Pandemic G2a and G2b are predominant PEDV genotype circulating in central China.

Viral tropism analyses have revealed two intriguing means of EBV infection, either by a receptor-mediated infection of B cells or by a cell-to-cell contact-mediated infection of non-susceptible ECs. Herein, we report a novel \u201Cin-cell infection\u201D mechanism for EBV infection of non-susceptible ECs through the formation of cell-in-cell structures. Epithelial CNE-2 cells were invaded by EBV-infected Akata B cells to form cell-in-cell structures in vitro. Such unique cellular structures could be readily observed in the specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Importantly, the formation of cell-in-cell structures led to the autonomous activation of EBV within Akata cells and subsequent viral transmission to CNE-2 cells, as evidenced by the expression of viral genes and the presence of virion particles in CNE-2 cells. Significantly, EBV generated from in-cell infected ECs displayed altered tropism with higher infection efficacy to both B cells and ECs. In addition to CNE-2 tumor cells, cell-in-cell structure formation could also mediate EBV infection of NPEC1-Bmi1 cells, an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. Furthermore, efficient infection by this mechanism involved the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, our study identified \u201Cin-cell infection\u201D as a novel mechanism for EBV infection. Given the diversity of virus-infected cells and the prevalence of cell-in-cell structures during chronic infection, we speculate that \u201Cin-cell infection\u201D is likely a general mechanism for EBV and other viruses to infect non-susceptible ECs.","publish_time":"2015-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ni, Chao; Chen, Yuhui; Zeng, Musheng; Pei, Rongjuan; Du, Yong; Tang, Linquan; Wang, Mengyi; Hu, Yazhuo; Zhu, Hanyu; He, Meifang; Wei, Xiawei; Wang, Shan; Ning, Xiangkai; Wang, Manna; Wang, Jufang; Ma, Li; Chen, Xinwen; Sun, Qiang; Tang, Hong; Wang, Ying; Wang, Xiaoning","journal":"Cell Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6637a61fc42c734211f7df5089e88f859d0da5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4493273.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916549/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2015.50","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBV","PI3K/AKT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell infection","cell structures","formation of cell","prevalence of cell","cell infected ECs","EBV infection of NPEC1","EBV infection of non-susceptible ECs","infected cells","cell structure formation","cell contact-mediated infection of non-susceptible ECs","Akata cells","chronic infection","efficient infection","Bmi1 cells","tumor cells","receptor-mediated infection of B cells","EBV-infected Akata B cells","non-susceptible epithelial cells","intriguing means of EBV infection","immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line","higher infection efficacy","autonomous activation of EBV","Epithelial CNE","susceptible B lymphocytes","novel mechanism","general mechanism","unique cellular structures","Viral tropism analyses","subsequent viral transmission","expression of viral genes","altered tropism","diversity of virus","Epstein-Barr virus","specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma","viruses","presence of virion particles","PI3K","AKT","addition","pathway","study"],"language":"en"},

Marmota himalayana is endemic to the Qinghai\u2013Tibetan Plateau, China. Here, based on a high-throughput method using Illumina RNA sequencing, we studied the RNA virome of M. himalayana and discovered multiple novel viruses, especially picobirnaviruses (PBVs), which have a bi-segmented genome and belong to the family Picobirnaviridae. A total of 63% of the viral contigs corresponded to PBVs, comprising 274 segment 1 and 56 segment 2 sequences. Unexpectedly, four unsegmented PBV genomes were also detected and confirmed by PCR and resequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the following nine PBV assortment types are proposed: C1:GI, C2:GIV, C4:GI, C4:GV, C5:GI, C7:GI, C8:GIV, C8:GV and C8:GII. We hypothesize a model of segmentation for the PBV genome, mediated by a 6-bp direct repeat sequence, GAAAGG. The model is supported by detection of the segmentation-associated sequence GAAAGG not only in the 5\u2032 untranslated regions of segment 1 (221 in 289) and segment 2 (57 in 80) of bi-segmented PBVs but also in the 5\u2032 untranslated regions and junction sequences between the capsid and RdRp genes of unsegmented PBVs. Therefore, with RNA sequencing, we found an unexpected biodiversity of PBVs in M. himalayana, indicating that M. himalayana is a special host for PBVs. We also proposed a putative model of how bi-segmented PBVs could be converted into unsegmented PBVs, which sheds new light on the processes of RNA virus genome evolution.","publish_time":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Xue-lian; Lu, Shan; Jin, Dong; Yang, Jing; Wu, Shu-sheng; Xu, Jianguo","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7531ccb3a8417e35a8a34badd9ae40ea731c7fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5841229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511159/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0020-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marmota"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["bi-segmented PBVs","unexpected biodiversity of PBVs","RdRp genes of unsegmented PBVs","C8","bi-segmented genome","untranslated regions of segment","RNA virome","Marmota himalayana","model of segmentation","Illumina RNA sequencing","unsegmented PBV genomes","GIV","C4","GV","processes of RNA virus genome evolution","putative model","segmentation-associated sequence GAAAGG","multiple novel viruses","PBV assortment types","main source of novel viruses","junction sequences","bp direct repeat sequence","capsid","Qinghai","C1","C7","C5","new light","emerging infectious diseases","C2","high-throughput method","Tibetan Plateau","detection","picobirnaviruses","phylogenetic analysis","China","GII","special host","family Picobirnaviridae","viral contigs","Wildlife","PCR","resequencing","total"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we modified rhCAT with the active polymer, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEG)-5000, and analyzed the pharmacokinetics of PEGylated rhCAT in mice. The high tetra-PEGylation ratio was about 60 %, and PEGylation prolonged the half-life of rhCAT in serum (75 vs. 13.5 min for native rhCAT). The protective effects of PEG-rhCAT were investigated in a mouse model of influenza virus A (H1N1)-associated pneumonia.

DIPs interfere with the propagation and spread of infectious standard virus (STV), reduce virus yields by competing for viral and cellular resources, and induce antiviral responses. These properties open exciting possibilities for the development of DIP-based antivirals. Exploring options for cell culture-based DIP production, we have established a fully continuous cultivation process, where one bioreactor is used to grow cells that are fed to two bioreactors operated in parallel for virus production. This system allows head-to-head comparisons of STV and DIP replication dynamics over extended time periods. Cultivations were performed at two residence times (RT, 22 and 36 h) using MDCK suspension cells grown in a fully defined medium. For infection, we used a virus seed generated by reverse genetics containing STVs and a known DIP carrying a deletion in segment 1 (delS1(1)). Four days post infection, DIPs achieved maximum concentrations of 7.0\u00B710(9) virions/mL and 8.4\u00B710(9) virions/mL for RTs of 22 and 36 h, respectively. Furthermore, oscillations in virus titers with two to three maxima were found for DIP accumulation at 36 and 22 h RT, respectively. To complement the study, a basic mathematical model using simple kinetics and a reasonable number of parameters to describe DIP-propagation in continuous cultures was established. Upon fitting the model individually to each of the two data sets, oscillations in the viral dynamics and the cell population dynamics were described well. Modeling suggests that both STV inactivation and virus degradation have to be taken into account to achieve good agreement of simulations and experimental data for longer RTs. Together, the high DIP titers obtained, and the successful simulation of the experimental data showed that the combination of continuous bioreactors and mathematical models can enable studies regarding DIP dynamics over extended time periods and allow large scale manufacturing of DIP-based antivirals.","publish_time":"2019-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tapia, Felipe; Laske, Tanja; Wasik, Milena A.; Rammhold, Markus; Genzel, Yvonne; Reichl, Udo","journal":"Front Bioeng Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/198bdc284caeafc6bbff6f925f36eec10d3d033c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6813217.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2019.00275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STV","MDCK","DIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DIP dynamics","DIP-propagation","development of DIP","DIP replication dynamics","known DIP","DIP accumulation","virus titers","virus production","high DIP titers","virus seed","virus degradation","cell culture-based DIP production","large scale manufacturing of DIP","viral dynamics","infectious standard virus","DIPs","experimental data","based antivirals","h RT","cell population dynamics","extended time periods","STV inactivation","data sets","combination of continuous bioreactors","continuous cultures","oscillations","virions","head-to-head comparisons of STV","basic mathematical model","continuous cultivation process","mathematical models","longer RTs","days post infection","MDCK suspension cells","studies","simple kinetics","good agreement of simulations","reverse genetics","reasonable number of parameters","STVs","natural byproduct of influenza","properties open exciting possibilities","maximum concentrations","successful simulation","account","cellular resources","deletion","segment","IAV","options","maxima","Defective interfering particles","antiviral responses","residence times","system","study","Cultivations","delS1","Modeling"],"language":"en"},

Design: a prospective, non\u2010interventional, purely serologically based diagnostic study. Setting: a tertiary university hospital in southern Israel. Subjects: 133 elderly patients hospitalised for non\u2010pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections. Methods: paired sera were obtained for each of the hospitalisations and were tested using immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay methods to identify 13 different pathogens. Only significant changes in antibody titers or levels between the paired sera were considered diagnostic. Results: at least one infectious aetiology was identified in 77 patients (58%). At least one of seven viral aetiologies was identified in 52 patients (39%). A bacterial aetiology was identified in 27 patients (20%) including Streptococcus pneumoniae in 24 (18%). An atypical bacterium was found in 27 patients (20%) including Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 15 (11%) and Legionella spp. in nine (7%). More than one aetiology was found in 23 patients (17%). One hundred and twenty nine patients (96%) suffered from serious chronic co\u2010morbidity. One hundred and twenty one patients received antibiotics during their hospitalisation, 106 (80%) with a beta\u2010lactam and 42 (31%) with another antibiotic. Conclusions: non\u2010pneumonic lower respiratory tract infection is caused in hospitalised elderly patients by a broad spectrum of aetiological agents, primarily respiratory viruses with a significant, though lesser, prevalence of classical and atypical bacteria. Despite this distribution of aetiologies, most patients are treated with beta\u2010lactam antibiotics.

These viruses can also cause infection in a range of domestic and wild animal species. Canine astrovirus (CaAstV) was first identified in the USA, and has since been reported in dogs from Europe, the Far East and South America. We sought to determine whether CaAstV is circulating in the UK dog population, and to characterise any identified strains. Stool samples were collected from pet dogs in the UK with and without gastroenteritis, and samples were screened for CaAstV by qPCR. Four CaAstV positive samples were identified from dogs with gastroenteritis (4/67, 6.0%), whereas no samples from healthy dogs were positive (p \u003C 0.001). Sequencing of the capsid sequences from the four CaAstV strains found significant genetic heterogeneity, with only 80% amino acid identity between strains. The full genome sequence of two UK CaAstV strains was then determined, confirming that CaAstV conforms to the classic genome organisation of other astroviruses with ORF1a and ORF1b separated by a frameshift and ORF2 encoding the capsid protein. This is the first report describing the circulation of CaAstV in UK dogs with clinical signs of gastroenteritis, and the first description of the full-length genomes of two CaAstV strains.","publish_time":"2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caddy, Sarah L.; Goodfellow, Ian","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59b5d767e4bb03b049a800c82c2e78edd0650907.json; document_parses/pdf_json/220fbe1f5e79e25737c0624de9a4245bfee48ec0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4401448.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818578/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515001157; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515001157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Europe","Far East","South America"],"keyphrases":["UK CaAstV strains","circulation of CaAstV","CaAstV positive samples","UK dogs","identified strains","healthy dogs","pet dogs","Stool samples","common cause of gastroenteritis","Astroviruses","clinical signs of gastroenteritis","UK dog population","genome sequence","capsid sequences","capsid protein","classic genome organisation","range of domestic","frameshift","ORF1a","Far East","significant genetic heterogeneity","wild animal species","ORF2","ORF1b","Europe","full-length genomes","South America","amino acid identity","infection","description","children","Sequencing","Canine astrovirus","report","qPCR","USA"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, effective measures such as pasteurization at 60\u00B0C for 10 hours have been implemented in the manufacturing process of therapeutic plasma proteins such as human albumin, coagulation factors, immunoglobulins, and enzyme inhibitors to inactivate blood\u2010borne viruses of concern. A comprehensive compilation of the virus reduction capacity of pasteurization is presented including the effect of stabilizers used to protect the therapeutic protein from modifications during heat treatment. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The virus inactivation kinetics of pasteurization for a broad range of viruses were evaluated in the relevant intermediates from more than 15 different plasma manufacturing processes. Studies were carried out under the routine manufacturing target variables, such as temperature and product\u2010specific stabilizer composition. Additional studies were also performed under robustness conditions, that is, outside production specifications. RESULTS: The data demonstrate that pasteurization inactivates a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics. After a maximum of 6 hours\u0027 incubation, no residual infectivity could be detected for the majority of enveloped viruses. Effective inactivation of a range of nonenveloped viruses, with the exception of nonhuman parvoviruses, was documented. CONCLUSION: Pasteurization is a very robust and reliable virus inactivation method with a broad effectiveness against known blood\u2010borne pathogens and emerging or potentially emerging viruses. Pasteurization has proven itself to be a highly effective step, in combination with other complementary safety measures, toward assuring the virus safety of final product.","publish_time":"2017-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gr\u00F6ner, Albrecht; Broumis, Connie; Fang, Randel; Nowak, Thomas; Popp, Birgit; Sch\u00E4fer, Wolfram; Roth, Nathan J.","journal":"Transfusion","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1e0852551db4c6d968544f15873a9ce0625b379.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169671.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.14390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29148053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging viruses","range of nonenveloped viruses","broad range of viruses","viruses of concern","virus inactivation kinetics of pasteurization","majority of enveloped viruses","virus reduction capacity of pasteurization","Effective inactivation","testing of plasma","effective measures","nonenveloped viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics","reliable virus inactivation method","virus safety of final product","different plasma manufacturing processes","manufacturing process of therapeutic plasma proteins","known blood","wide range of enveloped","risk of blood","effective step","complementary safety measures","broad effectiveness","therapeutic protein","routine manufacturing target variables","Additional studies","temperature","human albumin","immunoglobulins","coagulation factors","pathogens","starting material","enzyme inhibitors","METHODS","combination","hours\u0027 incubation","modifications","heat treatment","specific stabilizer composition","Careful selection","comprehensive compilation","derived products","residual infectivity","STUDY DESIGN","relevant intermediates","BACKGROUND","robustness conditions","exception of nonhuman parvoviruses","data","effect of stabilizers","maximum","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","production specifications"],"language":"en"},

To gain insights into evolutionary forces shaping the CEA gene family we have analysed this gene family in 27 mammalian species including monotreme and marsupial lineages. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis provided convincing evidence that the primordial CEA gene family in mammals consisted of five genes, including the immune inhibitory receptor-encoding CEACAM1 (CEA-related cell adhesion molecule) ancestor. Our analysis of the substitution rates within the nucleotide sequence which codes for the ligand binding domain of CEACAM1 indicates that the selection for diversification is, perhaps, a consequence of the exploitation of CEACAM1 by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens as their cellular receptor. Depending on the extent of the amplification of an ancestral CEACAM1, the number of CEACAM1-related genes varies considerably between mammalian species from less than five in lagomorphs to more than 100 in bats. In most analysed species, ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) or ITAM-like motif-containing proteins exist which contain Ig-V-like, ligand binding domains closely related to that of CEACAM1. Human CEACAM3 is one such protein which can function as a CEACAM1 decoy receptor in granulocytes by mediating the uptake and destruction of specific bacterial pathogens via its ITAM-like motif. The close relationship between CEACAM1 and its ITAM-encoding relatives appears to be maintained by gene conversion and reciprocal recombination. Surprisingly, secreted CEACAMs resembling immunomodulatory CEACAM1-related trophoblast-specific pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) found in humans and rodents evolved only in a limited set of mammals. The appearance of PSG-like genes correlates with invasive trophoblast growth in these species. CONCLUSIONS: These phylogenetic studies provide evidence that pathogen/host coevolution and a possible participation in fetal-maternal conflict processes led to a highly species-specific diversity of mammalian CEA gene families.","publish_time":"2010-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kammerer, Robert; Zimmermann, Wolfgang","journal":"BMC Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4714dd09f8ab317ec688ba087e67239b2b93367.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2832619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20132533/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-8-12","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ancestral CEACAM1","number of CEACAM1","exploitation of CEACAM1","CEACAM1 decoy receptor","primordial CEA gene family","ITAM","gene conversion","related genes","ligand binding domain of CEACAM1","mammalian species","evolving gene families","species-specific diversity of mammalian CEA gene families","immunomodulatory CEACAM1-related trophoblast-specific pregnancy-specific glycoproteins","analysed species","CEA-related cell adhesion molecule","destruction of specific bacterial pathogens","immune inhibitory receptor","cellular receptor","Phylogenetic analysis","ligand binding domains","convincing evidence","immune responses","phylogenetic studies","invasive trophoblast growth","limited set of mammals","possible participation","immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs","host coevolution","codes","PSGs","uptake","fetal-maternal conflict processes","nucleotide sequence","granulocytes","variety of viral","monotreme","evolutionary forces","substitution rates","secreted CEACAMs","rodents","reproduction","Ig-V","ancestor","RESULTS","marsupial lineages","carcinoembryonic antigen","biological functions","humans","CONCLUSIONS","insights","reciprocal recombination","diversification","consequence","amplification","selection","BACKGROUND","close relationship","relatives","appearance of PSG","Human CEACAM3","extent","lagomorphs","bats"],"language":"en"},

Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia and stress response et al, all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Early identification, timely and effective treatments, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis.

In order to determine the cis-acting sequences necessary for RNA replication, encapsidation, and budding and to approximate the minimal size of RNA that can be packaged into infectious particles, we constructed a series of internal deletions in the DI cDNA to generate plasmids that could be transcribed to yield RNAs which ranged in size from 2209 nucleotides down to 102 nucleotides. All the deletion plasmids retained at least 36 nucleotides from the 5\u2032-terminus and 51 nucleotides from the 3\u2032-terminus of the DI genome. In cells expressing the five VSV proteins, the deleted DI RNAs were examined for their ability to be encapsidated, to replicate, and to bud to produce infectious DI particles. An RNA as small as 191 nucleotides, which contained 46 nucleotides from the 5\u2032-end and 145 nucleotides from the 3\u2032-end of the DI genome was encapsidated, replicated, and budded at least as efficiently as the full-length wild-type DI RNA. In contrast, a 102-nucleotide RNA that contained only the 51 nucleotides from the 5\u2032-end of the DI RNA and its perfect 51-nucleotide complement at the 3\u2032-end replicated poorly and failed to bud infectious DI particles. However, an RNA with an insertion of 1499-nucleotide \u201Cstuffer\u201D sequences of non-VSV origin between the two 51-nucleotide complementary termini not only replicated but also budded infectious particles. These data show that the signals necessary for RNA encapsidation, replication, and packaging into infectious DI particles are contained within the 5\u2032-terminal 36 nucleotides and the 3\u2032-terminal 51 nucleotides of the DI RNA genome. Furthermore, the results show that a heterologous sequence can be replicated and packaged into infectious particles if it is flanked by the DI RNA termini.","publish_time":"1995-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pattnaik, Asit K.; Ball, L.

We investigated the impact of cardiac CT on the utilization of cardiac catheterization among children with congenital heart disease. Methods The study sample consisted of 2648 cardiac CT and 3814 cardiac catheterization from 1999 to 2009 for congenital heart diseases. Diagnoses were categorized into 11 disease groups. The numbers of examination, according to the different modalities, were compared using temporal trend analyses. The estimated effective radiation doses (mSv) of CT and catheterization were calculated and compared. Results The number of CT scans and interventional catheterizations had a slight annual increase of 1.2% and 2.7%, respectively, whereas that of diagnostic catheterization decreased by 6.2% per year. Disease groups fell into two categories according to utilization trend differences between CT and diagnostic catheterization. The increased use of CT reduces the need for diagnostic catheterization in patients with atrioventricular connection disorder, coronary arterial disorder, great vessel disorder, septal disorder, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventriculoarterial connection disorder. Clinicians choose either catheterization or CT, or both examinations, depending on clinical conditions, in patients with semilunar valvular disorder, heterotaxy, myocardial disorder, pericardial disorder, and pulmonary vein disorder. The radiation dose of CT was lower than that of diagnostic cardiac catheterization in all age groups. Conclusion The use of noninvasive CT in children with selected heart conditions might reduce the use of diagnostic cardiac catheterization. This may release time and facilities within the catheterization laboratory to meet the increasing demand for cardiac interventions.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Justin Cheng-Ta; Lin, Ming-Tai; Jaw, Fu-Shan; Chen, Shyh-Jye; Wang, Jou-Kou; Shih, Tiffany Ting-Fang; Wu, Mei-Hwan; Li, Yiu-Wah","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66ebbf141431d784fb5f8887c6e840777504b868.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126232.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092966461400237X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2014.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241602/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092966461400237X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic catheterization","utilization of cardiac catheterization","use of diagnostic cardiac catheterization","impact of cardiac CT","catheterization laboratory","pericardial disorder","myocardial disorder","septal disorder","use of noninvasive CT","increased use of CT","cardiac interventions","radiation dose of CT","atrioventricular connection disorder","ventriculoarterial connection disorder","number of CT scans","coronary arterial disorder","great vessel disorder","semilunar valvular disorder","pulmonary vein disorder","congenital heart diseases","disease groups","Purpose Pediatric cardiac computed tomography","selected heart conditions","patients","children","age groups","utilization trend differences","clinical conditions","noninvasive imaging modality","temporal trend analyses","estimated effective radiation doses","heterotaxy","interventional catheterizations","tetralogy of Fallot","mSv","need","Background","categories","increasing demand","slight annual increase","study sample","examinations","different modalities","time","facilities","Conclusion","numbers of examination","Methods","Diagnoses","Clinicians","year"],"language":"en"},

Incoming data reveal that the virus is highly virulent to humans. A model that categorizes coronaviuses according to the hardness of their shells was developed before the discovery of MERS-CoV. Using protein intrinsic disorder prediction, coronaviruses were categorized into three groups that can be linked to the levels of oral-fecal and respiratory transmission regardless of genetic proximity. Using this model, MERS-CoV is placed into disorder group C, which consists of coronaviruses that have relatively hard inner and outer shells. The members of this group are likely to persist in the environment for a longer period of time and possess the highest oral-fecal components but relatively low respiratory transmission components. Oral-urine and saliva transmission are also highly possible since both require harder protective shells. Results show that disorder prediction can be used as a tool that suggests clues to look for in further epidemiological investigations.","publish_time":"2013-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

For proof-of-concept, we used cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines specific for the melanoma-associated differentiation antigen tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2), or the model antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA), respectively. We generated recombinant measles vaccine vectors with TRP-2 and OVA epitope cassette variants for expression of the full-length antigen or the respective immunodominant CD8(\u002B) epitope, with additional variants mediating secretion or proteasomal degradation of the epitope. We show that these recombinant measles virus vectors mediate varying levels of MHC class I (MHC-I)-restricted epitope presentation, leading to activation of cognate CTLs, as indicated by secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN\u03B3) in vitro. Importantly, the recombinant OVA vaccines also mediate priming of na\u00EFve OT-I CD8(\u002B) T cells by dendritic cells. While all vaccine variants can prime and activate cognate T cells, IFN\u03B3 release was enhanced using a secreted epitope variant and a variant with epitope strings targeted to the proteasome. The principles presented in this study will facilitate the design of recombinant vaccines to elicit CD8(\u002B) responses against pathogens and tumor antigens.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busch, Elena; Kubon, Kristina D.; Mayer, Johanna K.

We further investigated the role of LF in the entry of SARS pseudovirus into HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells. Our results reveal that LF inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis suggested that LF was able to block the binding of spike protein to host cells at 4\u00B0C, indicating that LF exerted its inhibitory function at the viral attachment stage. However, LF did not disrupt the interaction of spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV. Previous studies have shown that LF colocalizes with the widely distributed cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Our experiments have also confirmed this conclusion. Treatment of the cells with heparinase or exogenous heparin prevented binding of spike protein to host cells and inhibited SARS pseudovirus infection, demonstrating that HSPGs provide the binding sites for SARS-CoV invasion at the early attachment phase. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to ACE2, HSPGs are essential cell-surface molecules involved in SARS-CoV cell entry. LF may play a protective role in host defense against SARS-CoV infection through binding to HSPGs and blocking the preliminary interaction between SARS-CoV and host cells. Our findings may provide further understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and aid in treatment of this deadly disease.","publish_time":"2011-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lang, Jianshe; Yang, Ning; Deng, Jiejie; Liu, Kangtai; Yang, Peng; Zhang, Guigen; Jiang, Chengyu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1f35ee252fdb019a824ad4778e8e220c27fc608.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3161750.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","SARS","LF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV invasion","SARS-CoV pathogenesis","SARS-CoV cell entry","entry of SARS pseudovirus","host cells","role of LF","LF colocalizes","inhibited SARS pseudovirus infection","HSPGs","functional receptor of SARS","binding of spike protein","ACE2-Myc cells","host defense","interaction of spike protein","binding sites","host immune response","essential cell-surface molecules","NK cell activity","Treatment","results","distributed cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans","preliminary interaction","protective role","early attachment phase","viral attachment stage","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","aid","exogenous heparin","HEK293E","neutrophil aggregation","inhibitory function","heparinase","angiotensin","dose-dependent manner","addition","enzyme","adhesion","deadly disease","Previous studies","analysis","experiments","conclusion","lactoferrin","findings"],"language":"en"},

Recently, a severe respiratory illness outbreak of HCoV-NL63 has been reported in a long-term care facility. Sambucus FormosanaNakai, a species of elderberry, is a traditional medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory and antiviral potential. The study investigated the antiviral activity of Sambucus FormosanaNakai stem ethanol extract and some phenolic acid constituents against HCoV-NL63. The extract was less cytotoxic and concentration-dependently increased anti-HCoV-NL63 activities, including cytopathicity, sub-G1 fraction, virus yield (IC50 = 1.17 \u03BCg/ml), plaque formation (IC50 = 4.67 \u03BCg/ml) and virus attachment (IC50 = 15.75 \u03BCg/ml). Among the phenolic acid constituents in Sambucus FormosanaNakai extract, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and gallic acid sustained the anti-HCoV-NL63 activity that was ranked in the following order of virus yield reduction: caffeic acid (IC(50) = 3.54 \u03BCM) \u003E chlorogenic acid (IC(50) = 43.45 \u03BCM) \u003E coumaric acid (IC(50) = 71.48 \u03BCM). Caffeic acid significantly inhibited the replication of HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner, and specifically blocked virus attachment (IC(50) = 8.1 \u03BCM). Therefore, the results revealed that Sambucus Formosana Nakai stem ethanol extract displayed the strong anti-HCoV-NL63 potential; caffeic acid could be the vital component with anti-HCoV-NL63 activity.

Turbidity was measured on combinations of virus and each sediment type at low concentration to determine aggregation rates. Aggregation of sediment with virus occurred regardless of mineral type, and larger fraction of virus is expected to aggregate with increasing sediment concentration leading to higher deposition rates. The negatively charged sediments, aggregated with \u03C66 (also negatively charged at neutral pH) at a faster rate than the positively charged sediments, yielding turbidity slopes of 4.94 \u00D7 10\u22123 s\u22121 and 7.50 \u00D7 10\u22124 s\u22121 for \u03C66-montmorillonite and \u03C66-illite aggregates, respectively, and 2.98 \u00D7 10\u22125 s\u22121 and 2.84 \u00D7 10\u22125 s\u22121, for \u03C66-goethite and \u03C66-kaolinite, respectively. This indicates that the interaction between sediments and virus is hydrophobic, rather than electrostatic. Large numbers of virions remained viable post-aggregation, despite the fragility of the viral envelope, indicating that small-sized aggregates, which may travel more readily through porous media, may pose an infection risk. The fraction of \u03C66 that remained viable varied with sediment type, with montmorillonite-\u03C66 aggregates experiencing the greatest reduction in infectivity at 35%.

Although typically encountered in children, it also occurs in adults with disease characteristics slightly different from the pediatric cases. Formerly, ADEM occurred particularly often in children with measles. However, the illness most often follows a non-descript viral or even bacterial infectious illness. ADEM occurs throughout the world, and may even be more common in less-developed countries, where MS is rare, than in developed ones, where MS is common. Children seldom get MS as opposed to adults, indicating that ADEM constitutes a distinct entity from MS. The prognosis of ADEM is generally good, but severe neurologic sequelae after ADEM are occasionally seen.

However, many of these systems are expensive and non-portable. Therefore, we developed a cost-effective and compact (2.9 \u00D7 5.8 \u00D7 2.0cm) thermopile array for fever screening of patients with infectious diseases in the clinical setting. Methods The array was created with small pixels (48 \u00D7 47 = 2256 pixels) fabricated on a silicon wafer using microelectromechanical systems technology. We tested this array on 155 febrile and afebrile patients (35.4\u00B0C \u2264 axillary temperature \u2264 39.3\u00B0C) with seasonal influenza at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. Results The maximum facial temperature, measured by the array at 0.3 m from the subject, exhibited a positive correlation with axillary temperature measured using a contact-type thermometer (r = 0.71, p \u003C 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of the thermopile array in identifying the febrile subjects were 80.5% and 93.3%, respectively, setting the threshold cut-off of maximum facial temperature at an appropriate value. Conclusions Our cost-effective thermopile array appears promising for future close-range fever screening of patients with infectious diseases at primary care doctor clinics, health care centers, and quarantine stations in developing and developed countries.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Guanghao; Saga, Tadafumi; Shimizu, Takao; Hakozaki, Yukiya; Matsui, Takemi","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06594cb8f332809a70287bf4a265254fee818016.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110536.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214014957; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.03.1398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858901/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214014957","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cost-effective thermopile array","axillary temperature","future close-range fever screening of patients","infectious diseases","afebrile patients","threshold cut-off of maximum facial temperature","microelectromechanical systems technology","febrile subjects","small pixels","clinical setting","developed countries","Summary Objective Infrared thermography systems","health care centers","primary care doctor clinics","quarantine stations","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","seasonal influenza","Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital","silicon wafer","airports","contact-type thermometer","SARS","positive correlation","appropriate value","Conclusions","sensitivity","specificity","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been implicated in NVRI in hospitalized preterm neonates. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of HCoV-related NVRI in neonates and children hospitalized in a PNICU and the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections in staff. All neonates (age\u226428 days) and children (age\u003E28 days) hospitalized between November 1997 and April 1998 were included. Nasal samples were obtained by cytological brush at admission and weekly thereafter. Nasal samples were taken monthly from staff. Virological studies were performed, using indirect immunofluorescence, for HCoV strains 229E and OC43, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus types A and B, paramyxoviruses types 1, 2 and 3 and adenovirus. A total of 120 patients were enrolled (64 neonates and 56 children). Twenty-two samples from 20 patients were positive (incidence 16.7%). In neonates, seven positive samples, all for HCoV, were detected (incidence 11%). Risk factors for NVRI in neonates were: duration of hospitalization, antibiotic treatment and duration of parenteral nutrition (P\u003C0.01). Monthly prevalence of viral infections in staff was between 0% and 10.5%, mainly with HCoV. In children, 15 samples were positive in 13 children at admission (seven RSV, five influenza and three adenovirus) but no NVRI were observed. In spite of a high rate of community-acquired infection in hospitalized children, the incidence of NVRI with common respiratory viruses appears low in neonates, HCoV being the most important pathogen of NRVI in neonates during this study period. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact on pulmonary function.","publish_time":"2002-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gagneur, A.; Sizun, J.; Vallet, S.; Legr, M.

The structural information of recently released crystal structures of main protease (Mpro) in APO and complex with inhibitors, N3, and 13b molecules was utilized to explore the binding site architecture through Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The stable state of Mpro was used to conduct extensive virtual screening of the aforementioned drug pool. Considering the recent success of HIV protease molecules, we also used anti-protease molecules for drug repurposing purposes. The identified top hits were further evaluated through MD simulations followed by the binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA. Interestingly, in our screening, several promising drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of Mpro. However, based on control (N3 and 13b), we have identified six potential molecules, Leupeptin Hemisulphate, Pepstatin A, Nelfinavir, Birinapant, Lypression and Octreotide which have shown the reasonably significant MM-GBSA score. Further insight shows that the molecules form stable interactions with hot-spot residues, that are mainly conserved and can be targeted for structure- and pharmacophore-based designing. The pharmacokinetic annotations and therapeutic importance have suggested that these molecules possess drug-like properties and pave their way for in-vitro studies.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mittal, Lovika; Kumari, Anita; Srivastava, Mitul; Singh, Mrityunjay; Asthana, Shailendra","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1768151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential molecules","b molecules","anti-protease molecules","potential inhibitors of Mpro","recent success of HIV protease molecules","aforementioned drug pool","drug repurposing purposes","promising drug candidates","MD simulations","promising drugs","stable state of Mpro","potential therapeutic strategies","N3","crystal structures of main protease","good pool","stable interactions","therapeutic importance","GBSA score","binding site architecture","Current approved drugs","extensive virtual screening","pharmacophore-based designing","binding free energy calculations","clinical trials","Nelfinavir","Molecular dynamics","Pepstatin","APO","COVID","Octreotide","Leupeptin Hemisulphate","silico techniques","hot-spot residues","novel coronavirus disease","Birinapant","complex","way","pandemic","Lypression","structural information","pharmacokinetic annotations","hits","properties","infecting millions of populations","vitro studies","control","insight"],"language":"en"},

Aim of the study Pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs), especially ursolic acid (UA), have been found as reversibly and competitively human neutrophil elastase (HNE) inhibitors. However, the limited solubility and poor bioavailability of PTs hinder their clinical use. Crude plant extracts may have a greater activity than isolated constituents of the equivalent dosage. In this study, an Eriobotrya japonica (loquat leaves) extract (triterpenoid composition of loquat leaves, TCLL) with enriched PTs such as UA was prepared. The study aims to compare the HNE inhibitory (HNEI) effect in vitro and the therapeutic effect on acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo between TCLL and UA. Materials and methods An HNEI activity bioassay was performed with Sivelestat sodium hydrate as a positive control. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammatory model was established to evaluate TCLL\u0027s therapeutic effect on ALI in vivo. The absorption of UA in TCLL and in UA alone was determined using a Caco-2 cell uptake model and LC-MS. Results The IC50 values of TCLL and UA for the HNEI effect were 3.26 \u00B1 0.56 \u03BCg/mL and 8.49 \u00B1 0.42 \u03BCg/mL (P \u003C 0.01), respectively. TCLL significantly improved the inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokine production in mice compared with the LPS group (P \u003C 0.05). Additionally, it performed better than the UA alone group (P \u003C 0.05). Moreover, the uptake by Caco-2 cells of UA in TCLL was higher than that in UA alone (P \u003C 0.05). Conclusion TCLL has a significant HNEI effect in vitro and a therapeutic effect on LPS-induced inflammation in a mouse model. Both the effects are more efficient than UA. Improved absorption of PTs in TCLL may be one explanation for these results.","publish_time":"2019-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jie; Xu, Hao-Yang; Wu, Yu-Juan; Zhang, Xing; Zhang, Liu-Qiang; Li, Yi-Ming","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e705c098f909abb8f4e863e4450eeed214fd7361.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703491/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.01.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874118341047; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874118341047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCLL","UA","HNEI"],"locations":["China","Japan"],"keyphrases":["cells of UA","absorption of UA","Conclusion TCLL","significant HNEI effect","TCLL\u0027s therapeutic effect","IC50 values of TCLL","Improved absorption of PTs","inflammatory cells","induced lung inflammatory model","enriched PTs","LPS group","HNEI activity bioassay","LPS-induced inflammation","poor bioavailability of PTs","mouse model","ALI","cell uptake model","Results","Caco","\u03BCg","inflammatory cytokine production","study Pentacyclic triterpenoids","triterpenoid composition of loquat leaves","greater activity","HNE inhibitory","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Eriobotrya japonica","acute lung injury","traditional herbal medicine","Sivelestat sodium hydrate","LC-","mice","isolated constituents","positive control","China","Japan","human neutrophil elastase","inhibitors","limited solubility","Materials","methods","Crude plant extracts","equivalent dosage","clinical use","ursolic acid","lipopolysaccharide","explanation","chronic bronchitis","coughs","effects"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we have examined the use of information embedded in the Hangeul Twitter stream to detect rapidly evolving public awareness or concern with respect to influenza transmission and developed regression models that can track levels of actual disease activity and predict influenza epidemics in the real world. Our prediction model using a delay mode provides not only a real-time assessment of the current influenza epidemic activity but also a significant improvement in prediction performance at the initial phase of ILI peak when prediction is of most importance.","publish_time":"2013-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Eui-Ki; Seok, Jong Hyeon; Oh, Jang Seok; Lee, Hyong Woo; Kim, Kyung Hyun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38709b5c18e24c3287a6b1b97ddbe8899cdab432.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3722273.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23894447/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic influenza","Influenza epidemics","influenza transmission","current influenza epidemic activity","higher level of influenza","early warnings of influenza outbreaks","prediction performance","prediction model","initial phase of ILI peak","developed regression models","accuracy of forecasting models","Hangeul Twitter stream","levels of actual disease activity","respect","evolving public awareness","messages","concern","populations","real-time assessment","significant improvement","free social networking service","delay mode","emergence of new virus strains","illness","accumulation of viral genetic changes","use of information","important task","real world","spread","normal season","importance","study"],"language":"en"},

So in this paper, we study the attribute reductions of three-way concept lattices in order to make the data easily be understood. Firstly, based on different criteria generated from object-induced three-way concept (OE-concept), four kinds of attribute reductions are proposed. The four reductions together embody different characteristics of a formal context and can be used in different occasions. Secondly, we discuss their relationships, including their advantages and disadvantages and the relationships among consistent sets and among the cores. Thirdly, based on attribute-induced three-way concept (AE-concept), we also give four attribute-induced three-way attribute reductions and discuss their relationships. Finally, the approaches to computing these attribute reductions are presented and the obtained results are demonstrated and verified by an empirical case. In this paper, we systematically investigate the attribute reductions of three-way concept lattices which enriches the study of formal concept analysis.","publish_time":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Ruisi; Wei, Ling","journal":"Knowledge-Based Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7878910b3988c9d30b8d2b0bd10581cf2842267.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126604.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288316/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705116000757; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0950705116000757; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2016.01.045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["three-way attribute reductions","attribute reductions of three-way concept lattices","OE-concept","Abstract Three-way concept analysis","AE-concept","study of formal concept analysis","kinds of attribute reductions","proposed area of formal concept analysis","relationships","formal context","different characteristics","different criteria","different occasions","paper","inclusion decision","exclusion decision","disadvantages","object","order","consistent sets","attributes","obtained results","cores","data","approaches","empirical case"],"language":"en"},

The HIV-1 protein Vpu counteracts tetherin by removing it from the site of viral budding, the plasma membrane, and this process depends on specific interactions between the transmembrane domains of Vpu and tetherin. In contrast, the glycoproteins (GPs) of two filoviruses, Ebola and Marburg virus, antagonize tetherin without reducing surface expression, and the domains in GP required for tetherin counteraction are unknown. Here, we show that filovirus GPs depend on the presence of their authentic transmembrane domains for virus-cell fusion and tetherin antagonism. However, conserved residues within the transmembrane domain were dispensable for membrane fusion and tetherin counteraction. Moreover, the insertion of the transmembrane domain into a heterologous viral GP, Lassa virus GPC, was not sufficient to confer tetherin antagonism to the recipient. Finally, mutation of conserved residues within the fusion peptide of Ebola virus GP inhibited virus-cell fusion but did not ablate tetherin counteraction, indicating that the fusion peptide and the ability of GP to drive host cell entry are not required for tetherin counteraction. These results suggest that the transmembrane domains of filoviral GPs contribute to tetherin antagonism but are not the sole determinants.","publish_time":"2014-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gnir\u00DF, Kerstin; Fiedler, Marie; Kr\u00E4mer-K\u00FChl, Annika; Bolduan, Sebastian; Mittler, Eva; Becker, Stephan; Schindler, Michael; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/033321dcd825a79a8ba380ba3d52d4ea71f45c81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4014715.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v6041654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tetherin counteraction","tetherin antagonism","host cell protein tetherin","fusion peptide of Ebola virus GP inhibited virus-cell fusion","transmembrane domains of Vpu","membrane fusion","authentic transmembrane domains","transmembrane domains of filoviral GPs","Marburg virus","ability of GP","Lassa virus GPC","heterologous viral GP","host cell entry","protein Vpu","filovirus GPs","mutation of conserved residues","plasma membrane","site of viral budding","release of enveloped viruses","filoviruses","presence","specific interactions","infected cells","process","surface expression","glycoproteins","HIV","sole determinants","contrast","insertion","results","recipient"],"language":"en"},

We argue that the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such measures. While a constrained form of consequentialism might provide a justification for such public health interventions, we argue that a stronger justification is provided by a principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue: a state may permissibly compel individuals to engage in activities that entail a small cost to them but a large benefit to others, because individuals have a moral duty of easy rescue to engage in those activities. The principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue gives rise to an Obligation Enforcement Requirement: the state should create the conditions such that submitting to coercive or compulsive measures becomes a fundamental moral duty of individuals, i.e. a duty of easy rescue. When the state can create such conditions, it has the strongest justification possible for implementing coercive or compulsive measures, because individuals have a moral duty to temporarily relinquish the rights that such measures would infringe. Our argument has significant implications for how public health emergencies in the developing world should be tackled.

Here we demonstrate that a novel DNA vaccine expressing a modified V antigen (LcrV) of Y. pestis, with a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence, elicited strong V-specific antibody responses in BALB/c mice. This tPA-V DNA vaccine protected mice from intranasal challenge with lethal doses of Y. pestis. In comparison, a DNA vaccine expressing the wild type V antigen was much less effective.

Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca2\u002B) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2\u002B binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2\u002B is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2\u002B. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2\u002B enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2\u002B interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2\u002B increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2\u002B, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca2\u002B interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca2\u002B ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Straus, Marco R.; Tang, Tiffany; Lai, Alex L.; Flegel, Annkatrin; Bidon, Miya; Freed, Jack H.; Daniel, Susan; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edf299be9be6a5616274c1c68448b880758b52f8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.881391","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV fusion","FP-Ca2","SARS-CoV FP","MERS-CoV WT PPs infection","increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering","interactions of MERS","number of Ca2","intracellular Ca2","life cycle of MERS","membrane fusion","fusion peptide","fusion dynamics","D residues","Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes","high sequence similarity","high sequence homology","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","aspartic acid","host cells","conserved glutamic acid","infection of pseudo-particles","mutant cell surface expression","binding pocket","protein","fusogenic activity","mutants ability","spike","potential","main determinant of viral entry","major emerging zoonotic infectious disease","Previous studies","crucial residue","important role","efficacious drugs","significant differences","confirmed cases","camels","fold","enhancement","E891","implications","isothermal calorimetry titration","vaccines","critical step","Electron spin resonance","humans","public health emergency","calcium","deaths","date","data","results","alanines","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

ORF9b as one of these accessory proteins is located in subgenomic mRNA9 and encodes a 98 amino acid protein. However, whether 9b protein is a structural component of SARS-CoV particles remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 9b protein is translated from bicistronic mRNA9 via leaky ribosome scanning and it is incorporated into both virus-like particles (VLPs) and purified SARS-CoV virions. Further analysis shows that sufficient incorporation of 9b protein into VLPs is dependent upon the co-expression of E and M proteins, but not upon the presence of either S or N protein. Our data indicate that 9b protein of SARS-CoV is another virion-associated accessory protein.

However, they occasionally provide poor protection owing to antigenic mismatch. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop universal vaccines against influenza virus. Using nucleoprotein (NP) and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) genes from the influenza A virus A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2), we constructed four recombinant vaccinia virus-based influenza vaccines carrying NP fused with one or four copies of M2e genes in different orders. The recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to immunize BALB/C mice. Humoral and cellular responses were measured, and then the immunized mice were challenged with the influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8). NP-specific humoral response was elicited in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying full-length NP, while robust M2e-specific humoral response was elicited only in the mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying multiple copies of M2e. All recombinant viruses elicited NP- and M2e-specific cellular immune responses in mice. Only immunization with RVJ-4M2eNP induced remarkably higher levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines specific to M2e. Furthermore, RVJ-4M2eNP immunization provided the highest cross-protection in mice challenged with 20 MLD(50) of PR8. Therefore, the cross-protection potentially correlates with both NP and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by RVJ-4M2eNP, which expresses a fusion antigen of full-length NP preceded by four M2e repeats. These results suggest that the rational fusion of NP and multiple M2e antigens is critical toward inducing protective immune responses, and the 4M2eNP fusion antigen may be employed to develop a universal influenza vaccine.

The disease is multifocal, with a course ranging from indolent, with only skin manifestations to fulminant, with extensive visceral involvement. In the current view, all forms of KS have a common etiology in human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection, and the differences among them are due to the involvement of various cofactors. In fact, HHV-8 infection can be considered a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of KS, because further factors (genetic, immunologic, and environmental) are required. The role of cofactors can be attributed to their ability to interact with HHV-8, to affect the immune system, or to act as vasoactive agents. In this contribution, a survey of the current state of knowledge on many and various factors involved in KS pathogenesis is carried out, in particular by highlighting the facts and controversies about the role of some drugs (quinine analogues and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in the onset of the disease. Based on these assessments, it is possible to hypothesize that the role of cofactors in KS pathogenesis can move toward an effect either favoring or inhibiting the onset of the disease, depending on the presence of other agents modulating the pathogenesis itself, such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, drug intake, or lymph flow disorders. It is possible that the same agents may act as either stimulating or inhibiting cofactors according to the patient\u2019s genetic background and variable interactions. Treatment guidelines for each form of KS are outlined, because a unique standard therapy for all of them cannot be considered due to KS heterogeneity.

One recombinant (113/Ho) has been studied in more detail. It multiplies only very slowly at 33\u00B0, the nonpermissive temperature. Adsorption and penetration are normal at 33\u00B0, but synthesis of protein is impeded. Temperature-shift experiments suggest that the synthesis of viral mRNA is slowed at 33\u00B0. 113/Ho does not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 40\u00B0, as the parent viruses do. 113/Ho can be adapted to grow normally at 33\u00B0.

The clinical course is typically self-limited and benign; however, rare cases of severe pneumonia can develop despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. We studied the effects of methylprednisolone pulse therapy on severe refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children. METHODS: The clinical effects of methylprednisolone therapy were evaluated retrospectively in 12 children with severe refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which was diagnosed serologically. All patients developed respiratory distress, high fever, and initial lobar pneumonic consolidation based on radiological findings. All clinical symptoms deteriorated despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Thus, children were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy in addition to antibiotics. RESULTS: The average febrile period before admission was 4.9\u00B11.7 days, and fever persisted in all children until steroid administration. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg) was given 5.4\u00B12.5 days after admission. After methylprednisolone pulse therapy, clinical symptoms improved in all patients without adverse events. The fever subsided 0-2 h after initiation of corticosteroid therapy. The abnormal radiological findings resolved within 2.6\u00B11.3 days, and the high C-reactive protein levels (6.7\u00B15.9 mg/dL) on admission decreased to 1.3\u00B11.7 mg/dL within 3.0\u00B11.1 days after starting corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Three-day methylprednisolone pulse therapy could be applied to treatment of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and appeared to be efficacious and well-tolerated.","publish_time":"2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"You, Sun Young; Jwa, Hye Jeong; Yang, Eun Ae; Kil, Hong Ryang; Lee, Jae Ho","journal":"Allergy Asthma Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d240c3f69f1c35702fea557f7a5436717be14cd3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3881395.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2014.6.1.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24404389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mycoplasma"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of methylprednisolone pulse therapy","intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy","Three-day methylprednisolone pulse therapy","clinical effects of methylprednisolone therapy","appropriate antibiotic therapy","pneumoniae pneumonia","children","initiation of corticosteroid therapy","days","clinical symptoms","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","admission","rare cases of severe pneumonia","high fever","clinical course","treatment of refractory","patients","abnormal radiological findings","high C-reactive protein levels","initial lobar pneumonic consolidation","addition","respiratory distress","average febrile period","CONCLUSIONS","antibiotics","common causes of community","RESULTS","PURPOSE","METHODS","adverse events","steroid administration"],"language":"en"},

The spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use, and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations. A total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries, and tested for fecal indicator bacteria, coliphages, human specific markers, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low, while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees. Of the enteric viruses, norovirus GII was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration. Although strong correlations were found between indicators, only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens. The results in this study showed that none of the bacteria/phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens. Inclusion of the alternative indicators, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Bacteroides and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human. The microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus, help to identify sites which have poor water quality. This approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality.","publish_time":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Shin Giek; Saeidi, Nazanin; Gu, Xiaoqiong; Vergara, Genevieve Gabrielle Rose; Liang, Liang; Fang, Haoming; Kitajima, Masaaki; Kushmaro, Ariel; Gin, Karina Yew-Hoong","journal":"Water Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3af50b021800015594a4a895b7e0825eb1731ad2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112093.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135418309874; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135418309874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528917/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of indicators","alternative indicators","phage indicators","presence of pathogens","temporal variation of indicators","water quality management","poor water quality","restoration of water quality","Abstract Fecal indicator bacteria","suitability of fecal indicator bacteria","pathogenic bacteria","water samples","fecal source","areas","human polyomaviruses","different land use","microbial distribution patterns","tributaries","major correlations","weak correlations","reservoirs","strong correlations","study","human specific markers","classification of sampling sites","contrasting land use","Escherichia coli","different clusters","microbial populations","enteric viruses","Bacteroides","coliphages","Methanobrevibacter smithii","impact of seasonal changes","universal predictors","factors","norovirus GII","HPyVs","years","health risks","occurrence","environmental parameters","high concentrations","Inclusion","approach","tropical aquatic environments","highest concentration","programs","Enterococcus","total","results","objective","degrees"],"language":"en"},

For centuries, preparations containing these compounds as the principal physiologically active constituents have been used to treat human diseases. Increasingly, this class of natural products is becoming the subject of anti-infective research, and many groups have isolated and identified the structures of flavonoids possessing antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activity. Moreover, several groups have demonstrated synergy between active flavonoids as well as between flavonoids and existing chemotherapeutics. Reports of activity in the field of antibacterial flavonoid research are widely conflicting, probably owing to inter- and intra-assay variation in susceptibility testing. However, several high-quality investigations have examined the relationship between flavonoid structure and antibacterial activity and these are in close agreement. In addition, numerous research groups have sought to elucidate the antibacterial mechanisms of action of selected flavonoids. The activity of quercetin, for example, has been at least partially attributed to inhibition of DNA gyrase. It has also been proposed that sophoraflavone G and (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate inhibit cytoplasmic membrane function, and that licochalcones A and C inhibit energy metabolism. Other flavonoids whose mechanisms of action have been investigated include robinetin, myricetin, apigenin, rutin, galangin, 2,4,2\u2032-trihydroxy-5\u2032-methylchalcone and lonchocarpol A. These compounds represent novel leads, and future studies may allow the development of a pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial agent or class of agents.","publish_time":"2005-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cushnie, T.

Previous studies demonstrate that SM is acquired by a Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive vesicular trafficking pathway, although paradoxically, this pathway is dispensable for bacterial replication. This finding suggests that other lipid transport mechanisms are involved in the acquisition of host SM. In this work, we interrogated the role of specific components of BFA-sensitive and BFA-insensitive lipid trafficking pathways to define their contribution in SM acquisition during infection. We found that C. trachomatis hijacks components of both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways for SM acquisition but that the SM obtained from these separate pathways is being utilized by the pathogen in different ways. We show that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts only one of the three known BFA targets, GBF1, a regulator of Arf1-dependent vesicular trafficking within the early secretory pathway for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition. The Arf1/GBF1-dependent pathway of SM acquisition is essential for inclusion membrane growth and stability but is not required for bacterial replication. In contrast, we show that C. trachomatis co-opts CERT, a lipid transfer protein that is a key component in non-vesicular ER to trans-Golgi trafficking of ceramide (the precursor for SM), for C. trachomatis replication. We demonstrate that C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner, VAP-A, and SM synthases, SMS1 and SMS2, to the inclusion and propose that these proteins establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion. We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen redirects SM biosynthesis to its replicative niche.","publish_time":"2011-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elwell, Cherilyn A.; Jiang, Shaobo; Kim, Jung Hwa; Lee, Albert; Wittmann, Torsten; Hanada, Kentaro; Melancon, Paul; Engel, Joanne N.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a73d97226cb958a94cd359666b35e092452818b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3164637.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21909260/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SM synthases","GBF1-dependent pathway of SM acquisition","trachomatis replication","vesicle-mediated SM acquisition","dependent vesicular trafficking","sensitive vesicular trafficking pathway","on-site SM biosynthetic factory","intracellular pathogen redirects SM biosynthesis","inclusion growth","non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways","trachomatis recruits CERT","acquisition of host","inclusion biogenesis","BFA-insensitive lipid trafficking pathways","bacterial replication","inclusion membrane growth","trachomatis hijacks components","non-vesicular ER","membrane-bound inclusion","CERT-dependent transport of ceramide","obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis replicates","early secretory pathway","lipid transport mechanisms","trans-Golgi trafficking of ceramide","lipid transfer protein","role of specific components of BFA","known BFA targets","separate pathways","stability","regulator of Arf1","host sphingomyelin","ER binding partner","key component","subsequent conversion","contribution","VAP","proteins","novel mechanism","replicative niche","SMS1","SMS2","precursor","process","work","infection","Brefeldin","results","different ways","Previous studies","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission. Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions. It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.

Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus.

METHODS: An online search in PUBMED database was conducted. Original articles on CF patients with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were included. We analyzed incidence, symptoms, clinical course and treatment. RESULTS: Four surveys with a total of 202 CF patients infected by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were included. The meta-analysis showed that hospitalisation rates were higher in CF patients compared to the general population. While general disease symptoms were comparable, the clinical course was more severe and case fatality rate (CFR) was higher in CF patients compared to asthmatics and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence so far suggests that CF patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 show increased morbidity and a higher CFR compared to patients with other chronic respiratory diseases and healthy controls. Particularly, CF patients with advanced stage disease seem to be more susceptible to severe lung disease. Accordingly, early antiviral and antibiotic treatment strategies are essential in CF patients. Preventive measures, including vaccination as well as hygiene measures during the influenza season, should be reinforced and improved in CF patients.","publish_time":"2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Renk, Hanna; Regamey, Nicolas; Hartl, Dominik","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ea47ba2d63a493e63f3152e04a8e20a097f1746.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3888399.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24427261/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CF patients","H1N1","clinical impact of Influenza","influenza season","general disease symptoms","higher CFR","clinical course","pdm09 infection","general population","severe lung disease","advanced stage disease","hygiene measures","Preventive measures","antibiotic treatment strategies","hospitalisation rates","case fatality rate","chronic respiratory diseases","increased morbidity","cystic fibrosis","asthmatics","early antiviral","online search","healthy controls","vaccination","total","Original articles","PUBMED database","meta-analysis","METHODS","literature","surveys","incidence","Evidence","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Widespread vaccination does not prevent the spread of FCV. Furthermore, the low fidelity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of FCV leads to the emergence of new variants, some of which show increased virulence. Currently, few effective anti-FCV drugs are available. Here, we found that germacrone, one of the main constituents of volatile oil from rhizoma curcuma, was able to effectively reduce the growth of FCV strain F9 in vitro. This compound exhibited a strong anti-FCV effect mainly in the early phase of the viral life cycle. The antiviral effect depended on the concentration of the drug. In addition, germacrone treatment had a significant inhibitory effect against two other reference strains, 2280 and Bolin, and resulted in a significant reduction in the replication of strains WZ-1 and HRB-SS, which were recently isolated in China. This is the first report of antiviral effects of germacrone against a calicivirus, and extensive in vivo research is needed to evaluate this drug as an antiviral therapeutic agent for FCV.","publish_time":"2016-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Hongxia; Liu, Yongxiang; Zu, Shaopo; Sun, Xue; Liu, Chunguo; Liu, Dafei; Zhang, Xiaozhan; Tian, Jin; Qu, Liandong","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aee2bac97ecff567f6d040080b360dd57a48d979.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087046.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997613/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-016-2825-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bolin"],"organizations":["FCV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spread of FCV","strong anti-FCV effect","effective anti-FCV drugs","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of FCV","growth of FCV strain F9","significant inhibitory effect","germacrone treatment","report of antiviral effects of germacrone","antiviral therapeutic agent","significant reduction","reference strains","Feline calicivirus","replication of strains WZ","early phase","cats","rhizoma curcuma","main constituents of volatile oil","respiratory tract","oral disease","viral life cycle","compound","low fidelity","emergence of new variants","HRB-SS","research","Bolin","addition","concentration","Widespread vaccination","contagious virus","increased virulence","China"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to determine the analgesic and sensorial benefits of two different amylmetacresol/2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA) throat lozenge formulation variants, AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, compared with an unflavoured, non-medicated placebo lozenge in the relief of acute sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infections. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, single-dose study, 225 adult patients with acute sore throat were randomly assigned to receive either one AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge (n = 77), one AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge (n = 74) or one unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (matched for size, shape and demulcency; n = 74). After baseline assessments, patients received their assigned lozenge and completed four rating assessments at 11 timepoints from 1 to 120 minutes post dose. Analgesic properties were assessed by comparing severity of throat soreness and sore throat relief ratings. Difficulty in swallowing, throat numbness, functional, sensorial and emotional benefits were also assessed. RESULTS: Both the AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge induced significant analgesic, functional, sensorial and emotional effects compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge. Sore throat relief, improvements in throat soreness and difficulty in swallowing, and throat numbness were observed as early as 1-5 minutes, and lasted up to 2 hours post dose. Sensorial benefits of warming and cooling associated with the AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, respectively, were experienced soon after first dose, and in the case of the latter, it lasted long after the lozenge had dissolved. Emotional benefits of feeling better, happier, less distracted and less frustrated were reported in those taking either of the AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants, with no differences in adverse events compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge. CONCLUSIONS: AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenges are well-tolerated and effective OTC treatment options, offering functional, sensorial and emotional benefits to patients with acute sore throat, over and above that of the rapid efficacy effects provided.

General George Washington ordered the entire American army to be variolated against smallpox after recognizing the serious threat that it posed to military operations. He did this on the recommendation from Dr. John Morgan, the physician-in-chief of the American army, who wrote a treatise on variolation in 1776. Although cases of smallpox still occurred, they were far fewer than expected, and it is believed that the vaccination program contributed to victory in the War of Independence. Effective military force requires personnel who are healthy and combat ready for worldwide deployment. Given the geography of US military operations, military personnel should also be protected against diseases that are endemic in potential areas of conflict. For this reason, and unknown to many, the US military has strongly supported vaccine research and development. Four categories of communicable infectious diseases threaten military personnel: (1) diseases that spread easily in densely populated areas (respiratory and dysenteric diseases); (2) vector-borne diseases (disease carried by mosquitoes and other insects); (3) sexually transmitted diseases (hepatitis, HIV, and gonorrhea); and (4) diseases associated with biological warfare. For each category, the US military has supported research that has provided the basis for many of the vaccines available today. Although preventive measures and the development of drugs have provided some relief from the burden of malaria, dengue, and HIV, the US military continues to fund research and development of prophylactic vaccines that will contribute to force health protection and global health. In the past few years, newly recognized infections with Zika, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses have pushed the US military to fund research and fast track clinical trials to quickly and effectively develop vaccines for emerging diseases. With US military personnel present in every region of the globe, one of the most cost-effective ways to maintain military effectiveness is to develop vaccines against prioritized threats to military members\u2019 health.","publish_time":"2018-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ratto-Kim, Silvia; Yoon, In-Kyu; Paris, Robert M.; Excler, Jean-Louis; Kim, Jerome H.; O\u2019Connell, Robert J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/915266f52a5f9c7360670df5de7b51d20e0a8cfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6021486.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29977239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["John Morgan"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["military effectiveness","US military personnel present","geography of US military operations","military members\u2019 health","Effective military force","dysenteric diseases","transmitted diseases","emerging diseases","vaccine research","fund research","development of prophylactic vaccines","categories of communicable infectious diseases","development of drugs","vaccines available","force health protection","global health","leading proponent of vaccine development","HIV","severe acute respiratory syndrome","entire American army","Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses","populated areas","cases of smallpox","potential areas of conflict","Zika","recognized infections","fast track clinical trials","prioritized threats","region","General George Washington","victory","years","relief","dengue","hepatitis","burden of malaria","cost-effective ways","serious threat","John Morgan","physician","worldwide deployment","past","globe","preventive measures","treatise","chief","mosquitoes","founding","basis","vector","vaccination program","War of Independence","recommendation","insects","gonorrhea","biological warfare","category","variolation","reason","fewer"],"language":"en"},

Methods 127 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Demographics, symptoms, underlying diseases and laboratory data were collected and assessed for predictive value. Results Of 127 COVID-19 patients, 16 cases (12.60%) were classified into the severe group. High level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reaction protein (CRP) and hypertension were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. The risk model based on IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, the baseline IL-6 was positively correlated with other immune-inflammatory parameters and the dynamic change of IL-6 in the severe cases were parallel to the amelioration of the disease. Conclusion Our study showed that high level of IL-6, CRP and hypertension were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of COVID-19. The risk model established upon IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest predictability in this study. Besides, IL-6 played a pivotal role in the severity of COVID-19 and had a potential value for monitoring the process of severe cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Zhe; Cai, Ting; Fan, Lingyan; Lou, Kehong; Hua, Xin; Huang, Zuoan; Gao, Guosheng","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/209b6403a23d6eebc8169aeab6c3da2ba3b9f72d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302575?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of COVID","CRP","hypertension","baseline IL","high level of IL","confirmed COVID","dynamic change of IL","risk model","severe groups","process of severe cases","study","independent risk factors","severity of coronavirus disease","clinical value of immune","potential value","predictive value","immune-inflammatory parameters","High level of interleukin","highest area","inflammatory markers","highest predictability","consecutive hospitalized patients","receiver operator characteristic curve","symptoms","underlying diseases","laboratory data","AUROC","Methods","C-reaction protein","amelioration","pivotal role","Demographics","Abstract Objective","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, while viral genomic RNAs persisted in infected cells over 14 subsequent passages with concomitant synthesis of viral subgenomic mRNAs and structural proteins, no infectious virus was isolated beyond passage 2. Further biochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that virions, while assembled, contained little spike in the envelope, indicating that lack of infectivity during persistence was likely due to deficiency in spike incorporation. This type of non-lytic, non-productive persistence in oligodendrocytes is unique among animal viruses and resembles MHV persistence previously observed in the mouse central nervous system.

These results suggest that CD4 T cells must recognize antigen in the CNS in order to cause demyelination.","publish_time":"2003-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haring, Jodie S.; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf93882c8b0e51464a8521e68388b8f34b00b50d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119464.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572803000419; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165572803000419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of bystander CD4 T cells","activated bystander CD8 T cells","CD4 T cell transgenic mice","demyelination independent","significant demyelination","T cell subset","MHV-specific CD4","MHV-infected mice","CNS","infection of mice","results","neurotropic coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM","antigen","central nervous system","order","Recent work","activation status"],"language":"en"},

They are associated with otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia. Annually, the economic impact of HRV infections costs billions in healthcare and lost productivity. Since 1987, 100 officially recognised HRV serotypes reside in two genetically distinct species; HRV A and HRV B, within the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. Sequencing of their \u223C7kb genomes was finalised in 2009. Since 1999, many globally circulating, molecularly\u2010defined \u2018strains\u2019, perhaps equivalent to novel serotypes, have been discovered but remain uncharacterised. Many of these currently unculturable strains have been assigned to a proposed new species, HRV C although confusion exists over the membership of the species. There has not been sufficient sampling to ensure the identification of all strains and no consensus criteria exist to define whether clinical HRV detections are best described as a distinct strain or a closely related variant of a previously identified strain (or serotype). We cannot yet robustly identify patterns in the circulation of newly identified HRVs (niHRVs) or the full range of associated illnesses and more data are required. Many questions arise from this new found diversity: what drives the development of so many distinct viruses compared to other species of RNA viruses? What role does recombination play in generating this diversity? Are there species\u2010 or strain\u2010specific circulation patterns and clinical outcomes? Are divergent strains sensitive to existing capsid\u2010binding antivirals? This update reviews the findings that trigger these and other questions arising during the current cycle of intense rhinovirus discovery.

Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is among the approaches to achieve these ends. We performed a systematic review of all interventional studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a focus on one repurposed drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The detailed analysis of these studies, some of them already recruiting, provide an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 prophylaxis around the world. Among the included studies, all but three were randomized and parallel and most of them (74%, 23/31) were double-blinded to quadruple-blinded studies. We found a great diversity in dosing and nearly all the possible scientifically reasonable regimens are under evaluation. This diversity offers benefits as well as challenges. Importantly, the final analysis of these trials should be done through an extensive reading of the results in regard to the clinical design, it will be crucial to carefully read and evaluate the results of each study in regards to the clinical design rather than quickly glancing a 140 characters-based social media message announcing the failure or success of a drug against a disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bienvenu, Anne-Lise; Marty, Aileen M.; Jones, Malcolm K.; Picot, Stephane","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/434e66f1433c9c6bf5c0d1eb70ffe2e937eaf238.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771420301622?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771420301622; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blinded studies","interventional studies","included studies","SARS-CoV2","repurposed drug","results","clinical design","manifestation of disease","post exposure drug","risk of serious disease","great diversity","final analysis","detailed analysis","asymptomatic shedding of SARS","overall picture of HCQ use","vaccine","COVID","failure","success","social media message","Hydroxychloroquine","study","regards","focus","extensive reading","approaches","medication","reasonable regimens","evaluation","absence","scientific community","prophylaxis","characters","dosing","trials","pre","viremia","systematic review","existing pharmaceuticals","Abstract","world","benefits","challenges","ends","search"],"language":"en"},

The disease is caused by Cryptosporidium spp. and is one of the most common causes of calf enteritis in the UK. The parasite is very difficult to remove from the farm, as the oocysts have a tough outer wall which enables the parasite to survive for several months in moist temperate environmental conditions and it is difficult to kill oocysts with common disinfectants used on a farm. If appropriate management practises are applied, the disease is usually self-limiting and most calves will recover. It has been shown, in studies with children and in lambs, that severe clinical cryptosporidiosis can result in long-term growth and cognitive impairment compared with individuals with no obvious signs of the disease. This study measured the long-term growth rate of beef calves on farm by comparing groups of animals that had suffered differing degrees of clinical severity of cryptosporidiosis as neonates. A group of 27 beef calves were enrolled in the study and monitored from birth to 6 months of age. The calves were scored for severity of cryptosporidiosis and weighed at regular intervals. The average difference in weight gain, at 6 months, between a group of calves that had severe cryptosporidiosis as neonates and a group of calves with no clinical signs of infection was 34 kg. Those calves that had experienced severe cryptosporidiosis as neonates showed a significantly reduced live weight gain compared with those calves showing no clinical signs of infection (P = 0.034). Therefore, the impact of severe cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves has longer term effects on weight gain and production efficiency, resulting in the parasite having a greater impact on cattle production than previously thought.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw, Hannah J.; Innes, Elisabeth A.; Morrison, Liam J.; Katzer, Frank; Wells, Beth","journal":"Int J Parasitol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/049ea8899e4cd0666b0098adac0fe9d50bf669a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194893.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2020.03.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751920300618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32277986/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020751920300618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group of calves","neonatal calves","severe clinical cryptosporidiosis","impact of severe cryptosporidiosis","long-term growth rate of beef calves","severe cases","differing degrees of clinical severity of cryptosporidiosis","clinical signs of infection","neonates","parasite","farm","disease","live weight gain","obvious signs","oocysts","months of age","study","production efficiency","cattle production","greater impact","common disinfectants","common causes of calf enteritis","longer term effects","individuals","lambs","moist temperate environmental conditions","cognitive impairment","groups of animals","tough outer wall","dehydration","diarrhoea","devastating effect","UK","death","children","birth","average difference","appropriate management practises","regular intervals","studies","Cryptosporidium"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the HRs sequences were designed and connected with a flexible linker. The recombinant fusion core protein was crystallized and its structure was solved at a resolution of 2.45 \u00C5. Then we characterized the binding of HR1s and HR2s via both sequence alignment and structural analysis. The overall structures, especially the residues in some positions of HR2 are highly conserved. Fourteen hydrophobic and three polar residues from each HR1 peptide are packed in layers at the coiled-coil interface. These core amino acids can be grouped into seven heptad repeats. Analysis of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between HR2 helix and HR1 helices, shows that the HR1 and HR2 polypeptides are highly complementary in both shape and chemical properties.

Previously, the human DEAD-box helicase DDX1 was suggested to be involved in Rev functions, but this relationship is not well understood. Biochemical studies of DDX1 and its interactions with Rev and model RNA oligonucleotides were carried out to investigate the molecular basis for association of these components. A combination of gel-filtration chromatography and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that recombinant DDX1 expressed in E. coli is a well-behaved folded protein. Binding assays using fluorescently-labeled Rev and cell-based immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed a specific RNA-independent DDX1-Rev interaction. Additionally, DDX1 was shown to be an RNA-activated ATPase, wherein Rev-bound RNA was equally effective at stimulating ATPase activity as protein-free RNA. Gel mobility shift assays further demonstrated that DDX1 forms complexes with Rev-bound RNA. RNA silencing of DDX1 provided strong evidence that DDX1 is required for both Rev activity and HIV production from infected cells. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a clear link between DDX1 and HIV-1 Rev in cell based assays of HIV-1 production, and provide the first demonstration that recombinant DDX1 binds Rev and RNA, and has RNA dependent catalytic activity.","publish_time":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edgcomb, Stephen P.; Carmel, Andrew B.; Naji, Souad; Ambrus-Aikelin, Geza; Reyes, Jason R.; Saphire, Andrew C.S.; Gerace, Larry; Williamson, James R.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/231377128610c5776532830eb8eb8d79f17fb120.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dce777a3e6cb754c1f6c10fe8ac010879e73716e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3249508.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283611011697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22051512/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611011697; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3249508?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.10.032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rev-bound RNA","Rev activity","Rev protein","RNA silencing of DDX1","recombinant DDX1","Rev functions","specific RNA-independent DDX1-Rev interaction","protein-free RNA","Biochemical studies of DDX1","DDX1 forms complexes","RNA-activated ATPase","model RNA oligonucleotides","RNA dependent catalytic activity","assays of HIV","HIV production","human DEAD-box helicase DDX1","ATPase activity","Binding assays","Gel mobility shift assays","well-behaved folded protein","cell-based immunoprecipitation analysis","processed mRNAs","combination of gel","translation of viral mRNAs","interactions","circular dichroism spectroscopy","filtration chromatography","virus","coli","strong evidence","infected cells","genome encapsidation","nuclear export","clear link","demonstration","molecular basis","association","components","relationship"],"language":"en"},

The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; encoded by ABCG2) regulates the fusion of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts and protects the fetus from maternally derived xenobiotics. Information about BCRP function in EVTs is limited, however placental exposure to bacterial/viral infection leads to BCRP downregulation in syncitiotrophoblasts. We hypothesized that BCRP is involved in the regulation of EVT function and is modulated by infection/inflammation. We report that besides syncitiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, BCRP is also expressed in EVTs. BCRP inhibits EVT cell migration in HTR8/SVneo (human EVT-like) cells and in human EVT explant cultures, while not affecting cell proliferation. We have also shown that bacterial\u2014lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2014and viral antigens\u2014single stranded RNA (ssRNA)\u2014have a profound effect in downregulating ABCG2 and BCRP levels, whilst simultaneously increasing the migration potential of EVT-like cells. Our study reports a novel function of BCRP in early placentation and suggests that exposure of EVTs to maternal infection/inflammation could disrupt their migration potential via the downregulation of BCRP. This could negatively influence placental development/function, contribute to existing obstetric pathologies, and negatively impact pregnancy outcomes and maternal/neonatal health.","publish_time":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lye, Phetcharawan; Bloise, Enrrico; Nadeem, Lubna; Peng, Chun; Gibb, William; Ortiga-Carvalho, Tania M.; Lye, Stephen J.; Matthews, Stephen G.","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02480623218229a12cdbc4800defc262f7cc175c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6829363.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells8101150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCRP","EVT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCRP function","BCRP downregulation","downregulation of BCRP","BCRP levels","novel function of BCRP","EVT cell migration","migration potential of EVT","regulation of EVT function","viral infection","maternal infection","human EVT explant cultures","exposure of EVTs","placental exposure","cells","placental perfusion","placental development","inflammation","syncitiotrophoblasts","viral antigens","downregulating ABCG2","cell proliferation","fusion of cytotrophoblasts","HTR8","ssRNA","SVneo","pregnancy outcomes","profound effect","early placentation","intrauterine growth restriction","single stranded RNA","decidua","existing obstetric pathologies","breast cancer resistance protein","fetus","neonatal health","LPS","pre-eclampsia","IUGR","syncytiotrophoblasts","lipopolysaccharide","Extravillous trophoblasts","study","Information","derived xenobiotics"],"language":"en"},

A total of 44 healthy adult Chinese rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: Group A (n=15), administered a combination of lipopolysaccharide and hormone to establish the SANFH animal model; group B (n=15), SANFH animal model as in group A orally administered LEV (0.4 g/kg/day) on the day of injection; and group C (n=14), the control group. On the 6th and 8th week of modeling, seven rabbits from each group were sacrificed to harvest bilateral femoral head specimens for hematoxylin and eosin staining and apoptosis detection by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay analysis, as well as for observing pathological changes and analyzing cellular apoptosis. Eight weeks after modeling, the serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels of the three groups were measured. The empty lacunae rate and apoptosis index of bone cells in the treatment group were significantly lower than that of the model group (P\u003C0.01). Eight weeks after treatment, the serum levels of IGF-1 were significantly higher than that of the model group (P\u003C0.01). These findings suggested that LEV was able to reduce steroid-induced bone cellular apoptosis, reduce the occurrence of necrosis of the femoral head and, through in vivo metabolism, it may promote the synthesis and release of IGF-1, which could be one of its biological pathways to prevent and treat SANFH.","publish_time":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xi, Hongbo; Tao, Weijian; Jian, Zhengguang; Sun, Xuefeng; Gong, Xiaohong; Huang, Lixin; Dong, Tianhua","journal":"Exp Ther Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d84ced2c3a06936bb56ee529a5bdca5f6adaf857.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5245153.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28123470/; https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2016.3964","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["LEV"],"organizations":["SANFH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model group","treatment group","group B","group C","control group","SANFH animal model","apoptosis detection","rabbit model of steroid","steroid-induced bone cellular apoptosis","administered LEV","serum levels of IGF","apoptosis index of bone cells","bilateral femoral head specimens","release of IGF","weeks","groups","associated necrosis","occurrence of necrosis","serum insulin","day of injection","week of modeling","healthy adult Chinese rabbits","terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick","eosin staining","hematoxylin","labeling assay analysis","hormone","growth factor","lacunae rate","total","effects of levodopa","synthesis","metabolism","pathological changes","combination of lipopolysaccharide","present study","findings","biological pathways"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have demonstrated that PBD-2 can kill various bacteria, regulate host immune responses and promote growth of piglets. However, the antiviral role of PBD-2 is rarely investigated. This study aimed to reveal the antiviral ability of PBD-2 against pseudorabies virus (PRV), the causative pathogen of Aujeszky\u2019s disease, in PK-15 cells and in a PBD-2 expressing transgenic (TG) mouse model. METHODS: In this study, the cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells was measured by CCK-8 assay. PK-15 cells were incubated with PRV pre-treated with different concentrations of PBD-2 and PRV titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). TG mice and wild-type (WT) mice were intraperitoneally injected with PRV and the survival rate was recorded for 10 days. Meanwhile, tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver of infected mice were observed and the viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung were analyzed by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: PBD-2 at a maximum concentration of 80 \u03BCg/mL displayed no significant cytotoxicity on PK-15 cells. A threshold concentration of PBD-2 at 40 \u03BCg/mL was required to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells. The survival rate in PBD-2 TG mice was 50% higher than that of WT mice. In addition, TG mice showed alleviated tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver compared with their WT littermates after PRV challenge, while viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung of TG mice were significantly lower than that of WT mice. CONCLUSIONS: PBD-2 could inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells and protect mice from PRV infection, which confirmed the antiviral ability of PBD-2 both in vitro and in vivo.

In most countries, containment has already started (on 17 March 2020 in France), and self-quarantine and social distancing are reducing viral contamination and saving lives. However, these considerations may only be the tip of the iceberg; most resources are dedicated to the struggle against COVID-19, and this unprecedented situation may compromise the management of patients admitted with cardiovascular conditions. AIM: We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 containment measures on cardiovascular admissions in France. METHODS: We asked nine major cardiology centres to give us an overview of admissions to their nine intensive cardiac care units for acute myocardial infarction or acute heart failure, before and after containment measures. RESULTS: Before containment (02\u201316 March 2020), the nine participating intensive cardiac care units admitted 4.8 \u00B1 1.6 patients per day, versus 2.6 \u00B1 1.5 after containment (17\u201322 March 2020) (rank-sum test P = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm here, for the first time, a dramatic drop in the number of cardiovascular admissions after the establishment of containment. Many hypotheses might explain this phenomenon, but we feel it is time raise the alarm about the risk for patients presenting with acute cardiovascular disease, who may suffer from lack of attention, leading to severe consequences (an increase in the number of ambulatory myocardial infarctions, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction leading to an increase in the number of cardiac arrests, unexplained deaths, heart failure, etc.). Similar consequences can be feared for all acute situations, beyond the cardiovascular disease setting.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huet, Fabien; Prieur, Cyril; Schurtz, Guillaume; Gerbaud, Edouard; Manzo-Silberman, St\u00E9phane; Vanzetto, Gerald; Elbaz, Meyer; Tea, Victoria; Mercier, Gr\u00E9goire; Lattuca, Beno\u00EEt; Duflos, Claire; Roubille, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Arch Cardiovasc Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28c52786b00db02245d29d26583d54d697209e18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186196.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875213620300991; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875213620300991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362433/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2020.04.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["acute cardiovascular disease","cardiovascular care of patients","number of cardiovascular admissions","containment measures","cardiovascular conditions","establishment of containment","cardiovascular disease setting","acute myocardial infarction","acute heart failure","acute situations","management of patients","number of cardiac arrests","participating intensive cardiac care units","number of ambulatory myocardial infarctions","increase","overview of admissions","Coronavirus disease","effect of COVID","France","time","mechanical complications of myocardial infarction","severe consequences","Similar consequences","unexplained deaths","social distancing","risk","viral contamination","self-quarantine","significant implications","dramatic drop","major cardiology centres","tip","resources","rank-sum test P","lack of attention","unprecedented situation","alarm","BACKGROUND","iceberg","METHODS","lives","struggle","hypotheses","phenomenon","considerations","day","countries","RESULTS","AIM","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and has been implicated in acute lung injury and myocardial dysfunction. The overwhelming inflammatory response in COVID-19 infection may be caused by disproportionately upregulated p38 activity, explained by two mechanisms. First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity is lost during SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs and heart and converts Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1\u20137. Angiotensin II signals proinflammatory, pro-vasoconstrictive, pro-thrombotic activity through p38 MAPK activation, which is countered by Angiotensin 1\u20137 downregulation of p38 activity. Loss of ACE2 upon viral entry may tip the balance towards destructive p38 signaling through Angiotensin II. Second, SARS-CoV was previously shown to directly upregulate p38 activity via a viral protein, similar to other RNA respiratory viruses that may hijack p38 activity to promote replication. Given the homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter may employ a similar mechanism. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may induce overwhelming inflammation by directly activating p38 and downregulating a key inhibitory pathway, while simultaneously taking advantage of p38 activity to replicate. Therapeutic inhibition of p38 could therefore attenuate COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, a prior preclinical study showed protective effects of p38 inhibition in a SARS-CoV mouse model. A number of p38 inhibitors are in the clinical stage and should be considered for clinical trials in serious COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grimes, Joseph M.; Grimes, Kevin V.","journal":"Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89e4efea500c7f98cd67b0ff34d416b9d49b6459.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422320/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022282820301899; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022282820301899?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.05.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["advantage of p38 activity","upregulated p38 activity","downregulation of p38 activity","destructive p38","angiotensin","p38 MAPK pathway","p38 MAPK activation","Therapeutic inhibition of p38","number of p38 inhibitors","protective effects of p38 inhibition","SARS-CoV mouse model","pro-thrombotic activity","infection","inflammatory effects","viral entry","attenuate COVID","serious COVID","Abstract COVID","release of pro-inflammatory cytokines","viral protein","overwhelming inflammatory response","lungs","heart","Loss of ACE2","clinical trials","clinical stage","overwhelming inflammation","similar mechanism","key inhibitory pathway","crucial role","RNA respiratory viruses","signals proinflammatory","mortality","prior preclinical study","balance","acute lung injury","myocardial dysfunction","major source of morbidity","enzyme","homology","mechanisms","replication"],"language":"en"},

After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins. In addition, four amino acid changes within the replicase gene-encoded proteins might be associated with TW2575/98 virus virulence.

Various structural classes of compounds have been identified as effective ingredients. However, little is known at genetics level about these active metabolites. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing for the first time to produce a comprehensive dataset of I. indigotica. RESULTS: A database of 36,367 unigenes (average length = 1,115.67 bases) was generated by performing transcriptome sequencing. Based on the gene annotation of the transcriptome, 104 unigenes were identified covering most of the catalytic steps in the general biosynthetic pathways of indole, terpenoid, and phenylpropanoid. Subsequently, the organ-specific expression patterns of the genes involved in these pathways, and their responses to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induction, were investigated. Metabolites profile of effective phenylpropanoid showed accumulation pattern of secondary metabolites were mostly correlated with the transcription of their biosynthetic genes. According to the analysis of UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGT) family, several flavonoids were indicated to exist in I. indigotica and further identified by metabolic profile using UPLC/Q-TOF. Moreover, applying transcriptome co-expression analysis, nine new, putative UGTs were suggested as flavonol glycosyltransferases and lignan glycosyltransferases. CONCLUSIONS: This database provides a pool of candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of effective metabolites in I. indigotica. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis and characterization of the significant pathways are expected to give a better insight regarding the diversity of chemical composition, synthetic characteristics, and the regulatory mechanism which operate in this medical herb.","publish_time":"2013-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Junfeng; Dong, Xin; Li, Qing; Zhou, Xun; Gao, Shouhong; Chen, Ruibing; Sun, Lianna; Zhang, Lei; Chen, Wansheng","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dab25c25f6598446d3b229d821402278b2bc0b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3890716.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24308360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Isatis"],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","UPLC/Q-TOF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Metabolites profile of effective phenylpropanoid","biosynthesis of effective metabolites","biosynthetic genes","transcriptome co-expression analysis","active metabolites","comprehensive analysis","Isatis indigotica","novo transcriptome sequencing","dependent glycosyltransferases","flavonol glycosyltransferases","significant pathways","analysis of UDP","database","lignan glycosyltransferases","effective ingredients","unigenes","accumulation pattern of secondary metabolites","general biosynthetic pathways of indole","pool of candidate genes","metabolic profile","medical herb","comprehensive dataset of","organ-specific expression patterns","influenza","fever","synthetic characteristics","diversity of chemical composition","putative UGTs","terpenoid","time","Traditional Chinese Medicine","regulatory mechanism","methyl jasmonate","clinical treatment of colds","MeJA","TCM","better insight","UPLC","family","responses","average length","catalytic steps","bases","characterization","Various structural classes of compounds","Q-TOF","induction","genetics level","transcription","present study","gene annotation","flavonoids","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUD","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we provide a full account of the evolutionary relationships between proteins of significant sequence and structural similarity found in viruses that belong to different classes according to the Baltimore classification. We show that such proteins can be found in viruses from all Baltimore classes. For protein families that include these proteins, we observe two patterns of the taxonomic spread. In the first pattern, they can be found in a large number of viruses from all implicated Baltimore classes. In the other pattern, the instances of the corresponding protein in species from each Baltimore class are restricted to a few compact clades. Proteins with the first pattern of distribution are products of so-called viral hallmark genes reported previously. Additionally, this pattern is displayed by the envelope glycoproteins from Flaviviridae and Bunyaviridae and helicases of superfamilies 1 and 2 that have homologs in cellular organisms. The second pattern can often be explained by horizontal gene transfer from the host or between viruses, an example being Orthomyxoviridae and Coronaviridae hemagglutinin esterases. Another facet of horizontal gene transfer comprises multiple independent introduction events of genes from cellular organisms into otherwise unrelated viruses.","publish_time":"2015-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caprari, Silvia; Metzler, Saskia; Lengauer, Thomas; Kalinina, Olga V.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6a6f1fcc991eaf6e733d88adb25a3a7a8e65546.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4632390.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7102882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26492264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Baltimore"],"keyphrases":["unrelated viruses","evolution of viruses","pattern of distribution","large number of viruses","implicated Baltimore classes","Baltimore classification","proteins of significant sequence","cellular organisms","different classes","facet of horizontal gene transfer","corresponding protein","protein families","multiple independent introduction events of genes","products of so-called viral hallmark genes","example","Bunyaviridae","Flaviviridae","evolutionary relationships","Orthomyxoviridae","species","structural similarity","host","envelope glycoproteins","helicases of superfamilies","Coronaviridae hemagglutinin esterases","account","instances","subject of ongoing debate","patterns","homologs","compact clades","taxonomic spread","origin","study"],"language":"en"},

Principal pathogens include Escherichia coli, rotaviruses, and noroviruses. 90% of diarrhoeal deaths are attributable to inadequate sanitation. Acute diarrhoea is the second leading cause of overall childhood mortality and accounts for 18% of deaths among children under five. In 2004 an estimated 1.5 million children died from diarrhoea, with 80% of deaths occurring before the age of two. Treatment goals are to prevent dehydration and nutritional damage and to reduce duration and severity of diarrhoeal episodes. The recommended therapeutic regimen is to provide oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and to continue feeding. Although ORS effectively mitigates dehydration, it has no effect on the duration, severity, or frequency of diarrhoeal episodes. Adjuvant therapy with micronutrients, probiotics, or antidiarrhoeal agents may thus be useful. The WHO recommends the use of zinc tablets in association with ORS. The ESPGHAN/ESPID treatment guidelines consider the use of racecadotril, diosmectite, or probiotics as possible adjunctive therapy to ORS. Only racecadotril and diosmectite reduce stool output, but no treatment has yet been shown to reduce hospitalisation rate or mortality. Appropriate management with validated treatments may help reduce the health and economic burden of acute diarrhoea in children worldwide.","publish_time":"2013-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faure, Christophe","journal":"Int J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8620ebc72710ffd02328954e8447585ffcb5cae2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3603675.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/612403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23533446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORS","diarrhoeal deaths","children","severity of diarrhoeal episodes","economic burden of acute diarrhoea","probiotics","leading cause of child mortality","diosmectite","duration","use of racecadotril","frequency of diarrhoeal episodes","Treatment goals","dehydration","leading cause of overall childhood mortality","ESPID treatment guidelines","Adjuvant therapy","possible adjunctive therapy","use of zinc tablets","health","rotaviruses","Escherichia coli","oral rehydration solutions","micronutrients","accounts","developing countries","validated treatments","Principal pathogens","recommended therapeutic regimen","antidiarrhoeal agents","nutritional damage","association","inadequate sanitation","stool output","Appropriate management","noroviruses","ESPGHAN","effect","hospitalisation rate"],"language":"en"},

Methods and Results: Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the N\u2010terminal half of spike protein (S1 protein) of TGEV were identified. Affinity constant of these mAbs was analysed. These mAbs were capable of reacting with the TGEV S1 protein analysed by ELISA and Western blot. A competition assay between the different mAbs was performed to determine whether the different antibodies mapped in the same or a different antigenic region of the protein. Investigation on the neutralizing ability of these mAbs indicated that two of these mAbs completely neutralized TGEV at an appropriate concentration. These mAbs were able to detect the TGEV\u2010infected cells in immunofluorescence assays and Western blot. Moreover, they differentiated TGEV S protein from other control proteins. Conclusions: The generated four mAbs are very specific, and the established immunofluorescence assays, Western blot and discrimination ELISA are useful approaches for detecting of TGEV.

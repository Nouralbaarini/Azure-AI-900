We hypothesized that patient outcomes would be improved at our tertiary cardiothoracic surgery referral center with a protocolized team-approach for ECMO treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old healthy female developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) bilateral pneumonia while vacationing in Colorado with her family. She was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care. Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate despite maximized critical care, including prone positioning ventilation and nitric oxide inhalation therapy. Veno-venous ECMO was initiated on hospital day 7 in conjunction with a 10-day course of compassionate use antiviral treatment with remdesivir. The patient\u2019s condition improved significantly and she was decannulated from ECMO on hospital day 17 (ECMO day 11). She was successfully extubated and eventually discharged to rehabilitation on hospital day 28. CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates a positive outcome in a young patient with COVID-19 treated by the judicious application of ECMO in conjunction with compassionate use antiviral treatment (remdesivir). Future prospective multi-center studies are needed to validate these findings in a larger cohort of patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firstenberg, Michael S.; Stahel, Philip F.; Hanna, Jennifer; Kotaru, Chakradhar; Crossno, Joseph; Forrester, Joseph","journal":"Patient Saf Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e03f54f198f291592949f0efaa54f3fbe7cc4998.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206578.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395179/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13037-020-00245-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":["China","Colorado"],"keyphrases":["ECMO day","ECMO treatment of patients","hospital day","judicious application of ECMO","Veno-venous ECMO","day course of compassionate use antiviral treatment","severe COVID","conjunction","respiratory failure","remdesivir","respiratory status","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","novel coronavirus disease","larger cohort of patients","rescue therapy","critical care","case report","CASE PRESENTATION","young patient","patient outcomes","higher level of care","nitric oxide inhalation therapy","tertiary cardiothoracic surgery referral center","Future prospective multi-center studies","prone positioning ventilation","year-old healthy female","protocolized team-approach","SARS-CoV","positive outcome","value of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","findings","bilateral pneumonia","high mortality rates","Colorado","early reports","Wuhan","China","BACKGROUND","facility","CONCLUSION","rehabilitation","patient\u2019s condition","family"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to the duration of illness. Cases of 10 or fewer days\u2019 duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of more than 10 days\u2019 duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies.

In addition, monitoring molecular changes in the virus can help elucidate chains of transmission and identify mutations that might influence virus transmission efficiency. This was illustrated by a recent laboratory investigation we conducted on an imported MERS-CoV case in Greece. Two oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected on the 1(st) and 2(nd) day of patient hospitalization and tested using two real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays targeting the UpE and Orf-1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome and RT-PCR and partial sequencing of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid genes. Serum specimens were also collected and serological test were performed. Results from the first swab sample were inconclusive while the second swab was strongly positive for MERS-CoV RNA by rRT-PCR and confirmed positive by RT-PCR and partial gene sequencing. Positive serologic test results further confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Full-length nucleocapsid and spike gene coding sequences were later obtained from the positive swab sample. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to recent human-derived MERS-CoV strains obtained in Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in April 2014 and dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These findings were consistent with the patient\u2019s history. We also identified a unique amino acid substitution in the spike receptor binding domain that may have implications for receptor binding efficiency. Our initial inconclusive rRT-PCR results highlight the importance of collecting multiple specimens from suspect MERS-CoV cases and particularly specimens from the lower respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2015-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kossyvakis, Athanasios; Tao, Ying; Lu, Xiaoyan; Pogka, Vasiliki; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Emmanouil, Mary; Mentis, Andreas F.; Tong, Suxiang; Erdman, Dean D.; Antoniadis, Antonios","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4eca3df95a8bf82f07ba51b6978bd4049f8df827.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4412533.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0125809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25919137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":["Middle East","Greece","Jeddah","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV RNA","MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV genome","suspect MERS-CoV cases","imported MERS-CoV case","real-time RT-PCR","positive swab sample","recent human-derived MERS-CoV strains","initial inconclusive rRT-PCR results","oropharyngeal swab specimens","multiple specimens","Positive serologic test results","Serum specimens","partial sequencing of RNA","virus transmission efficiency","partial gene sequencing","receptor binding efficiency","Saudi Arabia","spike receptor binding domain","dependent RNA polymerase","recent laboratory investigation","spike gene coding sequences","Full-length nucleocapsid","nucleocapsid genes","serological test","chains of transmission","timely implementation of infection control practices","lower respiratory tract","reliable laboratory diagnosis of persons","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","implications","Jeddah","importance","unique amino acid substitution","mutations","Makkah","regions","assays","disease management","dromedary camels","day of patient hospitalization","Qatar","UpE","Greece","findings","patient\u2019s history","Orf","molecular changes","addition","Phylogenetic analysis"],"language":"en"},

However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R\u003C1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.","publish_time":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kucharski, Adam J.; Edmunds, W.

No specific studies have been found that evaluate the impact of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic on AA and its surgical management. An analysis was made on the influence of this new pathology on the clinical course of AA. Material and methods: Retrospective observational study was conducted on patients operated on for AA from January to April 2020. They were classified according to the time of the appendectomy, before the declaration of the state of alarm (Pre-COVID-19), and after its declaration (Post-COVID-19) in Spain, one the most affected countries in the world. An evaluation was made of demographic variables, duration of symptoms, type of appendicitis, surgical time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Results: The study included 66 patients (41 Pre-COVID-19; 25 Post-COVID-19) with mean age of 10.7\u00B13 and 9.3\u00B13.1; p=.073, respectively. Fever was found in a higher number of post-COVID-19 patients (52 vs 19.5%; p=.013), as well as a higher CRP (72.7\u00B196.2 vs 31.3\u00B136.2 mg/dL; p=.042). This group presented with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis when compared to Pre-COVID-19 (32 vs 7.3%; p=.015). The mean hospital stay was longer in the Post-COVID-19 group (5.6\u00B15.9 vs 3.2\u00B14.3 days; p=.041). No differences were found in the time of onset of symptoms or surgical time. Conclusions: The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic influenced the time of diagnosis of appendicitis, as well as its course, and mean hospital stay. Peritonitis was more frequently seen. As a result of the significant circumstances, delaying diagnosis and treatment of AA during SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, inappropriate management of this common surgical disorder has been noticed.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Velayos, Mar\u00EDa; Mu\u00F1oz-Serrano, Antonio Jes\u00FAs; Estefan\u00EDa-Fern\u00E1ndez, Karla; Carmen Sarmiento Caldas, M\u00AA; Lape\u00F1a, Lucas Moratilla; L\u00F3pez-Santamar\u00EDa, Manuel; L\u00F3pez-Guti\u00E9rrez, Juan Carlos","journal":"An Pediatr (Barc)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6aa11d2caf786cb5b207db89f4739e44c6c911cf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S169540332030179X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S169540332030179X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2020.04.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pre-COVID","surgical time","vs","higher number of post-COVID","surgical management","time of diagnosis","pandemic","SARS-Cov","treatment of AA","patients","time of onset","mean hospital stay","common surgical disorder","clinical course of AA","type of appendicitis","Acute appendicitis","higher proportion of complicated appendicitis","common abdominal surgical emergency","higher CRP","declaration","group","mean age","duration of symptoms","inappropriate management","Retrospective observational study","demographic variables","new pathology","significant circumstances","Material","methods","Abstract Introduction","Spain","state of alarm","affected countries","influence","coronavirus","postoperative complications","world","evaluation","impact","Fever","Results","appendectomy","Conclusions","days","specific studies","analysis","differences","Peritonitis"],"language":"en"},

Methods Mongolian medicine with anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects is selected from Mongolian medicine prescription preparations. TCMSP, ETCM database and document mining methods were used to collect active compounds. Swiss TargetPrediction and SuperPred server were used to find targets of compounds with smiles number. Drugbank and Genecard database were used to collect antiviral drug targets. Then the above targets were compared and analyzed to screen out antiviral targets of Mongolia medicine. Metascape database platform was used to enrich and analyze the GO (Gene ontology) annotation and KEGG pathway of the targets. In view of the high homology of gene sequences between SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and SARS virus, as well as their similarities in pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, we established SARS-CoV-2 S-protein model using Swiss-Model. The ZDOCK protein docking software was applied to dock the S-protein with the human angiotensin ACE2 protein to find out the key amino acids of the binding site. Taking ACE2 as the receptor, the molecular docking between the active ingredients and the target protein was studied by AutoDock molecular docking software. The interaction between ligand and receptor is applied to provide a choice for screening anti-COVID-19 drugs. Results A total of 253 active components were predicted. Metascape analysis showed that key candidate targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways related to different toxins. These key candidate targets were mainly derived from phillyrin and chlorogenic acid. Through the protein docking between S-protein and ACE2, it is found that Glu329/Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2 play an important role in the binding process of the two. The results of molecular docking virtual calculation showed that phillyrin and chlorogenic acid could stably combine with Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2, respectively, which hindered the combination between S- protein and ACE2. Conclusion Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can effectively prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and ACE2 at the molecular level. Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can be used as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 for further research and development.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jiu-wang; Wang, Lu; Bao, Li-dao","journal":"J Funct Foods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f577bf9d30e119ba748f339b36df1e48810912f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1756464620302401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421102/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2020.104016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464620302401?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Genecard","KEGG"],"locations":["Mongolia"],"keyphrases":["S- protein","S-protein model","target protein","targets of compounds","human angiotensin ACE2 protein","ZDOCK protein docking software","S-protein RBD domain","molecular docking technology","key candidate targets","chlorogenic acid","antiviral targets of Mongolia medicine","antiviral drug targets","SARS-CoV","AutoDock molecular docking software","active compounds","molecular level","results of molecular docking virtual calculation","Methods Mongolian medicine","combination of SARS","SARS virus","active ingredients","Conclusion Phillyrin","active components","potential inhibitors of COVID","Mongolian medicine prescription preparations","antiviral effects","Asp38","Gln325","ETCM database","Swiss-Model","Genecard database","Gln42","Metascape database platform","receptor","key amino acids","screening anti-COVID","Gene ontology","binding site","binding process","Swiss TargetPrediction","Metascape analysis","document mining methods","high homology of gene sequences","annotation","KEGG pathway","important role","article","clinical manifestations","multiple pathways","similarities","TCMSP","choice","SuperPred server","Glu329","different toxins","pathogenesis","view","drugs","smiles number","Abstract Objective","interaction","ligand","research","Drugbank","total","development"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the human cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. ACE2 expression increases on lung alveolar epithelial cells and adipose tissue due to obesity, smoking and air pollution. A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept. Indeed, obesity, air pollution and smoking associated risk factors share underlying pathophysiologies that are related to the Renin-Angiotensin-System in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this review is to emphasize the mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction and its impact on the enhanced risk of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Engin, Ayse Basak; Engin, Evren Doruk; Engin, Atilla","journal":"Environmental toxicology and pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3234521c5a856ee96aa11f962a0b335c8454ff4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1382668920300879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422280/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103411; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668920300879?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","severe COVID","air pollution","smoking","infection","effects of obesity","underlying risk factors","renin-angiotensin system","ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept","associated risk factors","mechanism of receptor","causative agent of COVID","enhanced risk of death","ACE2 expression increases","human cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","underlying pathophysiologies","coronavirus disease","lung alveolar epithelial cells","excess ectopic fat accumulation","adipose tissue","impact","comorbid conditions","symptoms","RAS","smokers","component","significant relationship","review","pandemic","enzyme","aim"],"language":"en"},

PODD is a community-owned surveillance system that collects data from volunteer reporters; identifies disease outbreak automatically; and notifies the local governments (LGs), surrounding villages, and relevant authorities. This system provides a direct and immediate benefit to the communities by empowering them to protect themselves. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the PODD system for the rapid detection and control of disease outbreaks. METHODS: The system was piloted in 74 LGs in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with the participation of 296 volunteer reporters. The volunteers and LGs were key participants in the piloting of the PODD system. Volunteers monitored animal and human diseases, as well as environmental problems, in their communities and reported these events via the PODD mobile phone app. LGs were responsible for outbreak control and provided support to the volunteers. Outcome mapping was used to evaluate the performance of the LGs and volunteers. RESULTS: LGs were categorized into one of the 3 groups based on performance: A (good), B (fair), and C (poor), with the majority (46%,34/74) categorized into group B. Volunteers were similarly categorized into 4 performance groups (A-D), again with group A showing the best performance, with the majority categorized into groups B and C. After 16 months of implementation, 1029 abnormal events had been reported and confirmed to be true reports. The majority of abnormal reports were sick or dead animals (404/1029, 39.26%), followed by zoonoses and other human diseases (129/1029, 12.54%). Many potentially devastating animal disease outbreaks were detected and successfully controlled, including 26 chicken high mortality outbreaks, 4 cattle disease outbreaks, 3 pig disease outbreaks, and 3 fish disease outbreaks. In all cases, the communities and animal authorities cooperated to apply community contingency plans to control these outbreaks, and community volunteers continued to monitor the abnormal events for 3 weeks after each outbreak was controlled. CONCLUSIONS: By design, PODD initially targeted only animal diseases that potentially could emerge into human pandemics (eg, avian influenza) and then, in response to community needs, expanded to cover human health and environmental health issues.","publish_time":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yano, Terdsak; Phornwisetsirikun, Somphorn; Susumpow, Patipat; Visrutaratna, Surasing; Chanachai, Karoon; Phetra, Polawat; Chaisowwong, Warangkhana; Trakarnsirinont, Pairat; Hemwan, Phonpat; Kaewpinta, Boontuan; Singhapreecha, Charuk; Kreausukon, Khwanchai; Charoenpanyanet, Arisara; Robert, Chongchit Sripun; Robert, Lamar; Rodtian, Pranee; Mahasing, Suteerat; Laiya, Ekkachai; Pattamakaew, Sakulrat; Tankitiyanon, Taweesart; Sansamur, Chalutwan; Srikitjakarn, Lertrak","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5885059.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.7375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B.

The environmental dangers of sludge spreading on soils will be presented as well as their possible treatment scenarios to propose an acceptable reuse of sewage sludge in a circular economy.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rorat, Agnieszka; Courtois, Pauline; Vandenbulcke, Franck; Lemiere, S\u00E9bastien","journal":"Industrial and Municipal Sludge","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c63950e518474b14b821ac051e48eadd02613ddd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149543.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128159071000088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128159071000088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sewage sludge management","recycled sewage sludge","dehydrated sewage sludge","acceptable reuse of sewage sludge","volume of produced sewage sludge","environmental dangers of sludge","organic amendment","organic matter","treatment of wastewater","personal care products","possible treatment scenarios","field of environmental engineering","nanotechnology life cycle end products","microplastics","microorganisms","inorganic pollutants","huge challenge","synthetic hormones","Escherichia coli O157","phytopharmaceuticals","PPCP","potential source of soil contamination","silver","PAH","copper","polychlorobiphenyls","zinc","H7","biocides","toxic elements","residuals","pathogens","reservoir of nutrients","Salmonella typhimurium","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","remediation of contaminated sites","recycling","cadmium","lead","PCB","improvement","presence","New effective solutions","ecotoxicological risks","final effluent","circular economy","aspects","points of view conflict","health","quality","agriculture"],"language":"en"},

The tumorigenic potential of COX-2 and PGE2 through EP receptors forms the mechanistic context underlying the chemotherapeutic potential of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although role of the COX-2 is described in several viral associated malignancies, the biological significance of the COX-2/PGE2/EP receptor inflammatory axis is extensively studied only in Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV/HHV-8) associated malignancies such as KS, a multifocal endothelial cell tumor and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), a B cell-proliferative disorder. The purpose of this review is to summarize the salient findings delineating the molecular mechanisms downstream of COX-2 involving PGE2 secretion and its autocrine and paracrine interactions with EP receptors (EP1-4), COX-2/PGE2/EP receptor signaling regulating KSHV pathogenesis and latency. KSHV infection induces COX-2, PGE2 secretion, and EP receptor activation. The resulting signal cascades modulate the expression of KSHV latency genes (latency associated nuclear antigen-1 [LANA-1] and viral-Fas (TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain like interferon converting enzyme-like- inhibitory protein [vFLIP]). vFLIP was also shown to be crucial for the maintenance of COX-2 activation. The mutually interdependent interactions between viral proteins (LANA-1/vFLIP) and COX-2/PGE2/EP receptors was shown to play key roles in the biological mechanisms involved in KS and PEL pathogenesis such as blockage of apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, transformation, proliferation, angiogenesis, adhesion, invasion, and immune-suppression. Understanding the COX-2/PGE2/EP axis is very important to develop new safer and specific therapeutic modalities for KS and PEL. In addition to COX-2 being a therapeutic target, EP receptors represent ideal targets for pharmacologic agents as PGE2 analogues and their blockers/antagonists possess antineoplastic activity, without the reported gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicity observed with few a NSAIDs.","publish_time":"2013-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paul, Arun George; Chandran, Bala; Sharma-Walia, Neelam","journal":"Transl Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce8e4fef2d0b163a0822383d091fbcf85831870e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567332/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524413000777; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524413000777; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2013.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COX","KSHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EP receptors","EP axis","maintenance of COX","PGE2 secretion","PGE2 analogues","EP receptor activation","tumorigenic potential of COX","EP receptor inflammatory axis","viral associated malignancies","vFLIP","PEL pathogenesis","KSHV infection","regulating KSHV pathogenesis","expression of KSHV latency genes","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus","cervical cancer","prostate cancer","colon cancer","biological mechanisms","viral proteins","LANA","viral-Fas","NSAIDs","cell cycle regulation","multifocal endothelial cell tumor","mechanistic context","paracrine interactions","therapeutic target","biological significance","B cell-proliferative disorder","molecular mechanisms","interdependent interactions","role of cyclooxygenase","proinflammatory mechanistic aspects of Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma","primary effusion lymphoma","specific therapeutic modalities","chemotherapeutic potential of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","nasopharyngeal carcinoma","ideal targets","proliferation","transformation","blockage of apoptosis","pharmacologic agents","blockers","nuclear antigen","enzyme","invasion","antineoplastic activity","adhesion","angiogenesis","antagonists","HHV","EP1","Eicosanoid","lipid metabolite prostaglandin E2","key roles","death domain","interferon","cardiovascular toxicity","salient findings","TNFRSF6","resulting signal cascades","inhibitory protein","review","active area of investigation","immune-suppression","purpose","addition"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to describe the patterns of new visits for a sore throat, complications and tonsillectomy during 2 years in a cohort of patients with pharyngotonsillitis and non-infected controls. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a cohort of patients with acute sore throat (n = 207), and non-infected controls (n = 108). New visits, complications and tonsillectomy within 2 years was recorded and analyzed in relation to microbiological findings at inclusion. RESULTS: Patients with Group A streptococci (GAS) (12/66) reconsulted more often within 30 days than patients with no GAS (9/141) (p = 0.009) and patients with F. necrophorum (2/29). After 2 years, we observed no significant differences in reconsultations with regard to aetiology at inclusion. A single complication was recorded and 5 patients were planned for tonsillectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Group A streptococci were the sole aetiological agent associated with recurrent sore throat while F. necrophorum did not distinguish itself as a major cause of either recurrent infection or complications in this cohort. More studies, preferably with the focus on adolescents, are needed before F. necrophorum can be considered an important cause of pharyngotonsillitis.","publish_time":"2018-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pallon, Jon; Sundqvist, Martin; Hedin, Katarina","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a5586078edf5a43100db04f987d635d39fee4a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5749013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29291704/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2917-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cohort of patients","complications","tonsillectomy","years","necrophorum","recurrent sore throat","acute sore throat","streptococci","Group","non-infected controls","important cause of pharyngotonsillitis","inclusion","GAS","patterns of new visits","recurrent infection","major cause","Longtime follow-up studies","sole aetiological agent","reconsultations","regard","significant differences","aetiology","relation","BACKGROUND","retrospective chart review","METHODS","microbiological findings","RESULTS","focus","adolescents","CONCLUSIONS","single complication","days"],"language":"en"},

Objective To investigate the number of fall exacerbations and the incidence of RTIs in a pediatric asthmatic population using an at-home mucus collection methodology. Methods This was a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group exploratory study. Children, 4\u201311 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of asthma requiring use of an inhaled corticosteroid, a morning peak expiratory flow \u226570% predicted and a history of \u22651 asthma exacerbation during the previous respiratory viral season were eligible for enrollment. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 100/50 mcg or FP 100 mcg prior to starting school. Subjects collected mucus samples using an at-home kit when they experienced respiratory symptoms. Mucus samples obtained during symptomatic periods were analyzed for common respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The number of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was recorded. Results In total, 339 (FP/SAL, n = 171; FP, n = 168) subjects were randomized and included in the intent-to-treat population; 292 (86%) completed the study. Of the 537 mucus samples collected, 64% tested positive for viruses, but only 6% of positive samples were associated with an asthma exacerbation. Exacerbations were infrequent, with only 41 subjects reporting 49 exacerbations in total. Adverse events were reported in 66% of subjects. Conclusions In a susceptible population, the fall asthma exacerbation rates in children were low despite frequent detection of viral RTIs.

The fact that these regions can bind reciprocally between themselves provides a possible molecular basis for N protein oligomerization. Interestingly, cytoplasmic N molecules of MHV-infected cells constitutively assemble into oligomers through a process that does not require binding to genomic RNA.

Conventional methods for virus detection are labourious, time consuming, and only a single virus can be analysed in one assay. Objectives The objective of this study was to develop a novel real-time PCR method for multiple virus detection by melting curve analysis using Taqman probes in a single reaction. Study design As a model, six respiratory viruses were detected in one tube using three fluorophores. The specificity was assessed by cross-reaction tests with other common respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity was assessed by testing the limit of detection of the assay using artificial plasmids as the positive template. The clinical evaluation of the established assay was evaluated for the detection of respiratory viruses in clinical samples, and the results were compared with direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA). Results The six respiratory viruses were clearly distinguished by their respective melting temperature values in the corresponding fluorescence detection channels. No cross reactions were observed by cross reaction tests. The detection limits of this assay were 2 to 2 \u00D7 103 copies per reaction for each virus. The clinical evaluation of this assay was demonstrated by analysing 352 clinical samples, and 67(19.0%) samples were positive for at least one virus. The accordance rate between the established PCR and DFA testing was high, and ranged from 94.57% to 100%.

Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of vector design, robust antigen expression and protective immunity using this system. However, clinical use of adenoviral vectors for vaccine purposes is anticipated to be limited by vector immunity that is either preexisting or develops rapidly following the first inoculation with adenoviral vectors. Vector immunity inactivates the vector particles and rapidly removes the transduced cells, thereby limiting the duration of transgene expression. Due to strong vector immunity, subsequent use of the same vector is usually less efficient. In order to circumvent this limitation, nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been proposed as alternative vectors. In addition to eluding HAd immunity, these vectors possess most of the attractive features of HAd vectors. Several replication-competent or replication-defective nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been developed and investigated for their potential as vaccine delivery vectors. Here, we review recent advances in the design and characterization of various nonhuman adenoviral vectors, and discuss their potential applications for human and animal vaccination.","publish_time":"2006-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bangari, Dinesh S.; Mittal, Suresh K.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc39d839697c9a6791be6cdce7a556d8d1ed324c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a416350e5da8a35128cc4ab5d293c85d48f3e53d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1462960.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1462960?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X05009151; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X05009151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine vectors","alternative vectors","clinical use of adenoviral vectors","vaccine delivery vectors","replication-defective nonhuman adenoviral vectors","characterization of various nonhuman adenoviral vectors","strong vector immunity","vector particles","feasibility of vector design","protective immunity","potential applications","great potential","vaccine purposes","subsequent use","replication-competent","clinical studies","robust antigen expression","duration of transgene expression","animal vaccination","limitation","transduced cells","recent advances","system","eluding","attractive features","order","addition","inoculation"],"language":"en"},

Utilizing a previously generated mutant, we demonstrate that the absence of all four Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) accessory ORFs (deletion of ORF3, -4a, -4b, and -5 [dORF3-5]) has major implications for viral replication and pathogenesis. Importantly, attenuation of the dORF3-5 mutant is primarily driven by dysregulated host responses, including disrupted cell processes, augmented interferon (IFN) pathway activation, and robust inflammation.

The emergence of novel viruses is attributed to the status of co-existence of multiple types and subtypes of viruses in the reservoir hosts. For effective prediction of future viral epidemic or pandemic an in-depth understanding of the virome status in the key reservoir species is highly essential. METHODS: To obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of ducks by viral metagenomic approach, we deep sequenced the viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from the flock of 23 ducks which shared the water bodies with wild migratory birds. RESULT: In total 7,455,180 reads with average length of 146 bases were generated of which 7,354,300 reads were de novo assembled into 24,945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases and the remaining 100,880 reads were singletons. The duck virome were identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons (BLASTx E score, \u003C10(\u22123)) against viral reference database. Numerous duck virome sequences were homologous to the animal virus of the Papillomaviridae family; and phages of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, Tectiviridae, Microviridae families and unclassified phages. Further, several duck virome sequences had homologous with the insect viruses of the Poxviridae, Alphatetraviridae, Baculoviridae, Densovirinae, Iflaviridae and Dicistroviridae families; and plant viruses of the Secoviridae, Virgaviridae, Tombusviridae and Partitiviridae families, which reflects the diet and habitation of ducks. CONCLUSION: This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity and expands the knowledge about the spectrum of viruses harboured in the enteric tract of ducks.","publish_time":"2016-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fawaz, Mohammed; Vijayakumar, Periyasamy; Mishra, Anamika; Gandhale, Pradeep N.; Dutta, Rupam; Kamble, Nitin M.; Sudhakar, Shashi B.; Roychoudhary, Parimal; Kumar, Himanshu; Kulkarni, Diwakar D.; Raut, Ashwin Ashok","journal":"Gut Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c726b09add3a385ad9b4fa87e54130d78194dcd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4899906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27284287/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13099-016-0113-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subtypes of viruses","plant viruses","insect viruses","spectrum of viruses","virome status","enteric tract of ducks","habitation of ducks","reads","viral metagenomic approach","viral nucleic acid","viral reference database","emergence of novel viruses","unbiased measure of viral diversity","Numerous duck virome sequences","Microviridae families","effective prediction of future viral epidemic","Dicistroviridae families","Partitiviridae families","singletons","natural reservoir","reservoir hosts","bases","average length","key reservoir species","in-depth understanding","unclassified phages","sequence similarity comparisons of contigs","status of co-existence of multiple types","pandemic","Densovirinae","Iflaviridae","Alphatetraviridae","Tectiviridae","Virgaviridae","important waterfowl","animal virus","Baculoviridae","Caudovirales","feathers","water bodies","Anas platyrhynchos","cloacal swabs","Secoviridae","Poxviridae","Inoviridae","Papillomaviridae family","BLASTx E score","wild migratory birds","meat","eggs","Tombusviridae","diet","knowledge","BACKGROUND","flock","study","influenza","METHODS","CONCLUSION","novo","RESULT"],"language":"en"},

The mathematical model can help when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control as well as how they might affect the disease dynamics. Motivated by this, in this article, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures to mitigate disease transmission. We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number. Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control. To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined. Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mandal, Manotosh; Jana, Soovoojeet; Nandi, Swapan Kumar; Khatua, Anupam; Adak, Sayani; Kar, T.K.","journal":"Chaos Solitons Fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c808957fb64cb1e22530a3aa2ab5a3da641b2f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7218394.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302897?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406395/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109889; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920302897","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Maharashtra","Tamil Nadu","India"],"keyphrases":["disease control","government control measures","monitoring of control measures","governmental measures","optimal control problem","governmental intervention measures","disease transmission","disease dynamics","mathematical model","strategies of quarantine","susceptible humans","contact of exposed","essential reproduction number","basic reproduction number","quarantine class","best strategies","affected states","short-term trend of COVID","social isolation","media coverage","lockdown","terms","treatment","Maharashtra","Delhi","critical factor","proper medicine","recent pandemic","improvement of public hygiene","Tamil Nadu","sensitivity analysis","thorough dynamical behavior","vaccination","attention","cost","India","infected individuals","article"],"language":"en"},

Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a super-spreading event due to aerosolization that unduly risks healthcare workers. Methods Patients with severe COVID-19 that were on mechanical ventilation \u2265 5 days were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it. This improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea. This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure. Results From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan\u2019s campus of which 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 days (SD \u00B15 days). Currently, thirty-two (33%) patients do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty (41%) patients remain on full ventilator support, while 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven (7%) died as result of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients). None of health care providers have developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusions Our percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for healthcare workers.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Angel, Luis; Kon, Zachary N.; Chang, Stephanie H.; Rafeq, Samaan; Shekar, Saketh Palasamudram; Mitzman, Brian; Amoroso, Nancy; Goldenberg, Ronald; Sureau, Kimberly; Smith, Deane; Cerfolio, Robert J.","journal":"Ann Thorac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36ea71f8435bdaa8bdd7dabe5f731127fe72bdcb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339508/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003497520306032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520306032?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["New York University Langone Health Manhattan"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tracheostomy tube","Methods Patients","percutaneous dilational tracheostomy","invasive mechanical ventilation","standard mechanical ventilation","prolonged mechanical ventilation","novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique","procedure","days","severe COVID","mechanical ventilatory support","Tracheostomy related bleeding","Abstract Background COVID","healthcare workers","inflated endotracheal tube cuff","ventilator support","risk of virus aerosolization","health care providers","New York University Langone Health Manhattan\u2019s campus","symptoms","bronchoscope","significant mitigation","distal trachea","common complication","intubation","worldwide pandemic","super-spreading event","result of respiratory","multiorgan failure","mean time","SD","Conclusions","improved visualization","current guidelines","Results"],"language":"en"},

Filovirus research has been extensive since the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Due to their high pathogenicity and mortality, live filoviruses require Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) facilities, which have restricted the development of anti-filovirus vaccines and drugs. An HIV-based pseudovirus cell infection assay is widely used for viral entry studies in BSL-2 conditions. Here, we successfully constructed nine in vitro pseudo-filovirus models covering all filovirus genera and three in vivo pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models using Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Lloviu virus as representative viruses. The pseudo-filovirus-infected mice showed visualizing bioluminescence in a dose-dependent manner. A bioluminescence peak in mice was reached on day 5 post-infection for Ebola virus and Marburg virus and on day 4 post-infection for Lloviu virus. Two known filovirus entry inhibitors, clomiphene and toremiphene, were used to validate the model. Collectively, our study shows that all genera of filoviruses can be well-pseudotyped and are infectious in vitro. The pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models can be used for in vivo activity evaluation of anti-filovirus drugs. This sequential in vitro and in vivo evaluation system of filovirus entry inhibitors provides a secure and efficient platform for screening and assessing anti-filovirus agents in BSL-2 facilities.","publish_time":"2017-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Qing; Tang, Ke; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Chen, Panpan; Guo, Ying","journal":"Acta Pharm Sin B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b4c63b2763e95674b6048d7150da0b3eca21c94.json; document_parses/pdf_json/81c1b982a28194aa9787468b4e9c7158043f22b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5925413.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211383517303568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383517303568; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2017.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719780/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["filovirus genera","pseudo-filovirus models","Filovirus research","pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models","anti-filovirus agents","Ebola virus","pseudo-filovirus-infected mice","known filovirus entry inhibitors","Marburg virus","Lloviu virus","development of anti-filovirus vaccines","evaluation system of filovirus entry inhibitors","activity evaluation of anti-filovirus drugs","post-infection","BSL","genera of filoviruses","day","viral entry studies","live filoviruses","Ebola outbreak","facilities","HIV-based pseudovirus cell infection assay","visualizing bioluminescence","bioluminescence peak","fatal viral hemorrhagic fever","mortality","screening","efficient platform","Biosafety Level","clomiphene","humans","dose-dependent manner","high pathogenicity","toremiphene","representative viruses","conditions","study"],"language":"en"},

The mechanism of bioaerosols production and the effect of biofiltration on bioaerosol emissions were analyzed. The results showed that the bioaerosol emission concentrations were generally exceeded 104 CFU m\u22123, which would damage to human health. Biomass, inlet gas velocity, moisture content, temperature, and some other factors have significant influences on bioaerosol emissions. Moreover, as a result of the analysis done herein, different inactivation technologies and microbial immobilization of bioaerosols were proposed and evaluated as a potential solution for reducing bioaerosols emissions. The purpose of this paper is to make more people realize the importance of controlling the emissions of bioaerosols in the biofiltration process and to make the treatment of VOCs by biotechnology more environmentally friendly.

In this paper, the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 39 accidentally exposed patients to chlorine gas are reported and different emergency treatment modalities are also discussed. METHODS: Two emergency departments applications were retrospectively analyzed for evaluation of accidental chlorine gas exposure for year 2007. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to severity of clinical and laboratory findings based on the literature and duration of land of stay in the emergency department. The first group was slightly exposed (discharged within 6 hours), second group moderately exposed (treated and observed for 24 hours), and third group was severely exposed (hospitalized). Most of the patients were initially treated with a combination of humidified oxygen, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators. RESULTS: The average age was 17.03 \u00B1 16.01 years (95% CI). Seven (17.9%) of them were female and 29 (74.4%) were children. Twenty-four patients (61.5%) were included in the first, nine (23.1%) were in second and six (15.4%) were in the third group. The presenting symptoms were cough, nausea, and vomiting and conjunctiva hyperemia for the first group, first groups symptoms plus dyspnea for the second group. Second groups symptoms plus palpitation, weakness and chest tightness were for the third group. Cough and dyspnea were seen in 64.1% and 30.8% of the patients respectively. No patients died.

The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, this is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Methods: Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms \u201Ccough,\u201D \u201Cchronic bronchitis,\u201D and \u201CCOPD.\u201D Results: The most effective way to reduce or eliminate cough in patients with chronic bronchitis and persistent exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards is avoidance. Therapy with a short-acting inhaled \u03B2-agonist, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral theophylline, and a combined regimen of inhaled long-acting \u03B2-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid may improve cough in patients with chronic bronchitis, but there is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, expectorants, postural drainage, or chest physiotherapy. For the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids (or in severe cases IV corticosteroids) are useful, but their effects on cough have not been systematically evaluated. Therapy with expectorants, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy, and theophylline is not recommended. Central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing. Conclusions: Chronic bronchitis due to cigarette smoking or other exposures to inhaled noxious agents is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in the general population.

Longitudinal analysis based on multivariate linear regression models assessed changes in outcome variables (CO2, O2, heart rate, perceived comfort items, compliance measures, and others). Analyses compared changes over time, and compared wearing only an N95 to wearing an N95 with a surgical mask overlay. Results Most nurses (90%, n = 9) tolerated wearing respiratory protection for two 12-hour shifts. CO2 levels increased significantly compared with baseline measures, especially when comparing an N95 with a surgical mask to only an N95, but changes were not clinically relevant. Perceived exertion; perceived shortness of air; and complaints of headache, lightheadedness, and difficulty communicating also increased over time. Almost one-quarter (22%) of respirator removals were due to reported discomfort. N95 adjustments increased over time, but other compliance measures did not vary by time.

Immunoprophylaxis might be considered for adults at high\u2010risk for frequent and severe RSV infection. Thus, we studied the incidence of RSV\u2010related medically attended acute respiratory illness (MARI) in adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Subjects \u226550 years of age with Gold Class III/IV COPD and/or American Heart Association class III/IV CHF and exposure to children \u2265once per month were recruited. Subjects were evaluated over 1.5 to 2.5 years for RSV\u2010associated MARI, defined as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or seroresponse. RESULTS: Four hundred forty\u2010five subjects were enrolled between October 2011 and May 2012. Overall, 99 RSV infections were documented by PCR or serology for a cumulative incidence of 22.2%. Of these, 42 (9.4%) subjects had protocol\u2010specified RSV\u2010MARI for an incidence of 4.68/100 patient\u2010seasons. All\u2010cause MARI was common (63.85/100 patient\u2010seasons) with rhinovirus most commonly identified. CONCLUSION: RSV infection was common in adults with severe COPD and/or advanced CHF. Given the severity of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases in the study population, most illnesses were surprisingly mild.

Using recombinant ArkDPI S1 proteins, we conducted binding assays on chicken tracheas and embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Protein histochemistry showed that the Y43H change allows for enhanced binding to trachea, whereas the ArkDPI S1 spike with H43 alone was able to bind CAM. Using Western blot under denaturing conditions, ArkDPI serotype-specific sera did not bind to S1 proteins with \u2206344, suggesting that \u2206344 alters antigenicity of S1.

Its propagation and symptom progress are very rapid. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics, laboratory results and mortality factors of probable SARS cases. Methods This study was adopted with a retrospective research design to study probable SARS cases from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou and Kaoshiung from August 2003 to February 2004, with a total of 78 cases (average age, 44 years; standard deviation, 18 years; age range, 13\u201384 years) including 24 males (30.8%) and 54 females (69.2%). Results Most of the 78 cases involved nosocomial infection (56.4%). A total of 24 patients died, and the mortality rate was as high as 30.8%. Logistic regression analysis found that intubation (odds ratio, 115; p \u003C 0.001) was the mortality forecast factor. Conclusion The mortality rate of intubation patients was 115 times higher than that of those who did not require intubation. Therefore, special care must be taken with SARS disease with severe infiltration chest X-ray images and respiratory distress. Positive medical treatment should be performed to lower the mortality rate.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Tei-Chu; Chang, Wen-Han; Jiang, Bing-Cheng; Maa, Suh-Hwa; Chien, Ding-Kuo; Tang, Woung-Ru","journal":"International Journal of Gerontology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8c6f2435ef49ac0da46c2b6c3ea7273fbd1dc9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873959809700183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288876/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1873959809700183; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1873-9598(09)70018-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Linkou"],"keyphrases":["SARS disease","mortality factors of probable SARS cases","mortality rate of intubation patients","SARS-CoV","years","study","mortality forecast factor","respiratory distress","total","new respiratory tract infectious disease","SUMMARY Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","average age","age range","laboratory results","severe infiltration chest X-ray images","Chang","standard deviation","Memorial Hospital","clinical characteristics","retrospective research design","odds ratio","contagious coronavirus","Linkou","Logistic regression analysis","Conclusion","times higher","propagation","symptom progress","Kaoshiung","special care","Positive medical treatment","nosocomial infection","Methods","females"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted among Chinese residents in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to identify the origins of SARS risk perceptions and their impact on precautionary actions and adverse consequences from the perspective of vulnerable communities living in unaffected regions. Analysis was informed by protection motivation theory. RESULTS: Results revealed that information from affected Asia influenced risk perceptions and protective behavior among the Chinese in Europe when more relevant local information was absent. When high risk perceptions were combined with low efficacy regarding precautionary measures, avoidance-based precautionary action appeared to dominate responses to SARS. These actions may have contributed to the adverse impacts of SARS on the communities.

After the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014\u20132015, there was need to strengthen IDSR to ensure prompt detection and response to epidemic-prone diseases. We describe the processes, successes and challenges of revitalizing public health surveillance in a country recovering from a protracted Ebola virus disease outbreak. METHODS: The revitalization process began with adaptation of the revised IDSR guidelines and development of customized guidelines to suit the health care systems in Sierra Leone. Public health experts defined data flow, system operations, case definitions, frequency and channels of reporting and dissemination. Next, phased training of IDSR focal persons in each health facility and the distribution of data collection and reporting tools was done. Monitoring activities included periodic supportive supervision and data quality assessments. Rapid response teams were formed to investigate and respond to disease outbreak alerts in all districts. RESULTS: Submission of reports through the IDSR system began in mid-2015 and by the 35th epidemiologic week, all district health teams were submitting reports. The key performance indicators measuring the functionality of the IDSR system in 2016 and 2017 were achieved (WHO Africa Region target \u226580%); the annual average proportion of timely weekly health facility reports submitted to the next level was 93% in 2016 and 97% in 2017; the proportion of suspected outbreaks and public health events detected through the IDSR system was 96% (n = 87) in 2016 and 100% (n = 85) in 2017. CONCLUSION: With proper planning, phased implementation and adequate investment of resources, it is possible to establish a functional IDSR system in a country recovering from a public health crisis. A functional IDSR system requires well trained workforce, provision of the necessary tools and guidelines, information, communication and technology infrastructure to support data transmission, provision of timely feedback as well as logistical support.

However, factors that affect NDV replication in host cells are poorly understood. NDV generates long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules during transcription of single-stranded genomic RNA. Protein kinase R (PKR) is activated by dsRNA. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of PKR in NDV infection. RESULTS: NDV infection led to the activation of dsRNA-dependent PKR and phosphorylation of its substrate, translation initiation factor eIF2\u03B1, in a dose-dependent manner by either the lentogenic strain LaSota or a velogenic strain Herts/33. PKR activation coincided with the accumulation of dsRNA induced by NDV infection. PKR knockdown remarkably decreased eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation as well as IFN-\u03B2 mRNA levels, leading to the augmentation of extracellular virus titer. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown or phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 or okadaic acid treatment significantly impaired NDV replication, indicating the critical role of the PKR/eIF2\u03B1 signaling cascade in NDV infection. CONCLUSION: PKR is activated by dsRNA generated by NDV infection and inhibits NDV replication by eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation.

Multiple factors may contribute to the development of PH in this setting. In this review, we report the results of a systematic search of the available peer-reviewed literature for papers that measured indices of pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with ARDS and reported on mortality in the period 1977 to 2010. There were marked differences between studies, with some reporting strong associations between elevated pulmonary arterial pressure or elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and mortality, whereas others found no such association. In order to discuss the potential reasons for these discrepancies, we review the physiological concepts underlying the measurement of pulmonary haemodynamics and highlight key differences between the concepts of resistance in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. We consider the factors that influence pulmonary arterial pressure, both in normal lungs and in the presence of ARDS, including the important effects of mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient (TPG) depend not alone on the intrinsic properties of the pulmonary vascular bed but are also strongly influenced by cardiac output, airway pressures and lung volumes. The great variability in management strategies within and between studies means that no unified analysis of these papers was possible. Uniquely, Bull et al. (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 182:1123\u20131128, 2010) have recently reported that elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and TPG were independently associated with increased mortality in ARDS, in a large trial with protocol-defined management strategies and using lung-protective ventilation. We then considered the existing literature to determine whether the relationship between PVR/TPG and outcome might be causal.

This protein of the transferrin family has broad antimicrobial properties by depriving pathogens from iron, or disrupting their plasma membranes through its highly cationic charge. Noteworthy, Lf also exhibits immunomodulatory activities performing up- and down-regulation of innate and adaptive immune cells, contributing to the homeostasis in mucosal surfaces exposed to myriad of microbial agents, such as the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Although the inflammatory process is essential for the control of invasive infectious agents, the development of an exacerbated or chronic inflammation results in tissue damage with life-threatening consequences. In this review, we highlight recent findings in in vitro and in vivo models of the gut, lung, oral cavity, mammary gland, and liver infections that provide experimental evidence supporting the therapeutic role of human and bovine Lf in promoting some parameters of inflammation and protecting against the deleterious effects of bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoan-associated inflammation. Thus, this new knowledge of Lf immunomodulation paves the way to more effective design of treatments that include native or synthetic Lf derivatives, which may be useful to reduce immune-mediated tissue damage in infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drago-Serrano, Maria Elisa; Campos-Rodr\u00EDguez, Rafael; Carrero, Julio C\u00E9sar; de la Garza, Mireya","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/435c259a0b1c77cb1fab63dabf76fa1637d8e645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5372517.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18030501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28257033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine Lf","synthetic Lf derivatives","immune-mediated tissue damage","parameters of inflammation","new knowledge of Lf immunomodulation","chronic inflammation results","adaptive immune cells","protozoan-associated inflammation","control of invasive infectious agents","regulation of innate","infectious diseases","mucosal surfaces","mucosal secretions","primary innate immune-defense system of mammals present","myriad of microbial agents","broad antimicrobial properties","lung","iron","mammary gland","milk","way","development","therapeutic role of human","oral cavity","liver infections","experimental evidence","transferrin family","depriving pathogens","effective design of treatments","homeostasis","glycoprotein","deleterious effects of bacterial","life-threatening consequences","models","plasma membranes","gut","recent findings","cationic charge","inflammatory process","immunomodulatory activities","review","respiratory tracts","Lactoferrin"],"language":"en"},

Treatment with the NF-\u03BAB-specific inhibitor BAY11-7082 significantly decreased TGEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine production, but did not affect virus replication. Phosphorylation of NF-\u03BAB subunit p65 and proinflammatory cytokine production were greatly decreased after knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) or its adaptors MAVS and STING, while only slight reduction was observed in cells following silencing of Toll-like receptor adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF. Furthermore, TGEV infection significantly upregulated mRNA expression of RIG-I and MDA5.

The RNA silencing pathway is an intracellular innate response to viral infections. However, it is unknown whether PRRSV interacts with cellular RNA silencing to facilitate the viral infection. Here, we report for the first time the interaction between PRRSV and RNA silencing in both the porcine macrophages and African green monkey kidney cell line (MARC-145) cell line, which were derived from African green monkey kidney cells and highly permissive for PRRSV infection. Our data demonstrated that PRRSV suppressed RNA silencing induced by short-hairpin (sh) RNA, double-strand (ds) RNA and microRNA (miRNA) and downregulated the expression of argonaute protein-2 (Ago-2), which is a key protein of the RNA silencing pathway in animal cells. Further, exogenous introduction of siRNA and shRNA downregulated Dicer or Ago-2 proteins of the cellular RNA silencing apparatus in MARC-145 cells and porcine macrophages, which, in turn, increased the viral replication and titers. The viral non-structure protein 1\u03B1 (nsp-1\u03B1) and nsp11 of PRRSV were identified as the suppressors for cellular RNA silencing (RSSs) to downregulate the Ago-2 protein. Our results identify that PRRSV, through its nsp proteins, suppresses the cellular RNA silencing apparatus in favor of viral infection and supports a co-evolutionary process of the virus and the cellular RNA silencing process.","publish_time":"2015-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jing; Shi, Xibao; Zhang, Xiaozhuan; Wang, Li; Luo, Jun; Xing, Guangxu; Deng, Ruiguang; Yang, Hong; Li, Jinting; Wang, Aiping; Zhang, Gaiping","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/060833389f07819960d34c91e0dfdc92e053f6ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4632401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512690/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7102893","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA silencing pathway","cellular RNA silencing apparatus","cellular RNA silencing process","PRRSV infection","nsp11 of PRRSV","favor of viral infection","viral infections","viral replication","viral non-structure protein","porcine macrophages","key protein","African green monkey kidney cells","MARC","African green monkey kidney cell line","nsp proteins","animal cells","expression of argonaute protein","respiratory syndrome virus","intracellular innate response","co-evolutionary process","shRNA downregulated Dicer","host\u2019s immune response","ds","double-strand","short-hairpin","exogenous introduction of siRNA","suppressors","miRNA","microRNA","turn","RSSs","interaction","time","data","titers","results"],"language":"en"},

FMD vaccine is the traditional way to protect against the disease, which can greatly reduce its occurrence. However, the use of FMD vaccines to protect early infection is limited. Therefore, the alternative strategy of applying antiviral agents is required to control the spread of FMDV in outbreak situations. As previously reported, LiCl has obviously inhibition effects on a variety of viruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), and pseudorabies herpesvirus and EV\u2010A71 virus. In this study, our findings were the first to demonstrate that LiCl inhibition of the FMDV replication. In this study, BHK\u201021 cell was dose\u2010dependent with LiCl at various stages of FMDV. Virus titration assay was calculated by the 50% tissue culture infected dose (TCID(50)) with the Reed and Muench method. The cytotoxicity assay of LiCl was performed by the CCK8 kit. The expression level of viral mRNA was measured by RT\u2010qPCR. The results revealed LiCl can inhibit FMDV replication, but it cannot affect FMDV attachment stage and entry stage in the course of FMDV life cycle. Further studies confirmed that the LiCl affect the replication stage of FMDV, especially the early stages of FMDV replication. So LiCl has potential as an effective anti\u2010FMDV drug. Therefore, LiCl may be an effective drug for the control of FMDV.

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to describe the accuracy of available tests to detect COVID-19 in Brazil. We searched at the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) online platform to describe the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies and for tests using naso/oropharyngeal swabs in the random-effects models. We identified 16 tests registered, mostly rapid-tests. Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures [95%CI] were: (i) for IgM antibodies Se=82% [76-87]; Sp=97% [96-98]; DOR=168 [92-305] and SROC=0.98 [0.96-0.99]; (ii) for IgG antibodies Se=97% [90-99]; Sp=98% [97-99]; DOR=1994 [385-10334] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]; and (iii) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen or molecular assays in naso/oropharyngeal swabs Se=97% [85-99]; Sp=99% [77-100]; DOR=2649 [30-233056] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]. These tests can be helpful for emergency testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. However, it is important to highlight the high rate of false negative results from tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the initial course of the disease and the scarce evidence-based validation results published in Brazil. Future studies addressing the diagnostic performance of tests for COVID-19 in the Brazilian population are urgently needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro, Rodolfo; Luz, Paula M; Wakimoto, Mayumi D; Veloso, Valdilea G; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Perazzo, Hugo","journal":"Braz J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9b8cedbc75e76fb5d9d8220abc6eb63c3b22a39.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330437/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867020300295?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2020.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867020300295","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgM/IgG"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["rapid-tests","accuracy of available tests","COVID","diagnostic performance of tests","DOR","SROC","IgM antibodies Se","IgG antibodies Se","oropharyngeal swabs Se","detection of IgM","Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures","naso","detection of SARS","SARS-CoV","diagnostic odds ratio","pooled sensitivity","Brazilian population","Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency","scarce evidence-based validation results","high rate of false negative results","online platform","summary receiver","ANVISA","molecular assays","specificity","characteristic curves","disease","antigen","initial course","emergency testing","random-effects models","Future studies","pandemic","meta-analysis"],"language":"en"},

The main focus was generating information regarding different livestock diseases considered important by villagers and their relevance, as well as obtaining knowledge concerning hunting activities and cooking methods to gain a better understanding of the interrelationship of people and animals and the diseases of their animals. RESULTS: For poultry, an overall prevalence of 41 % of Newcastle disease was found by means of the ELISA test by antibody detection, chicken being the most affected species in the village. No samples were positive to avian influenza with the HI test. No virus was isolated by means of the tracheal or cloaca swabbing of ducks. FOR HUNTING: All species could be hunted by chance at any time of the year. There was a difference in species hunted between seasons, peccaries being more frequently hunted during the dry season and in contrast, deer and wild avian during the rainy season. FOR COOKING: Villagers did not consume any raw meat. The cooking methods depended on the species. Stewing was the most favoured method for peccaries, wild birds, tepezcuintle and domestic poultry, whereas grilling was preferable for deer, roasting for armadillos and marinating for pork. CONCLUSION: According to the generated information, the most important domestic livestock species in the village are chickens and pigs, chickens being the most affected by diseases. No evident health problems on pigs were observed in this study. Hunting was shown as an activity enhanced by poverty and the lack of employment opportunities in the village and was mostly directed at larger species such as deer and peccaries. From the viewpoint of a transmission of zoonoses from animals to humans cooking methods mostly reflected a protective factor as no raw meat was eaten, stews and broths being the most common forms of cooking, involving an exposure of meat to high temperatures. Nonetheless, both agricultural and hunting activities represent a risk factor for the spread of diseases as hunters may act as mechanical vectors for different pathogens within domestic and wild animal populations.","publish_time":"2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E9rida Ru\u00EDz, Samuel Alberto; Guerra Centeno, Dennis Sigfried; Bailey Leonardo, Edgar Leonel; Rohn, Karl; K\u00F6sters, Sarah; Kreienbrock, Lothar","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40ab93e7916aabc26190092d088a37d43b3240fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4825071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27055652/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-016-2009-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":["Guatemala"],"keyphrases":["domestic animals","affected species","important domestic livestock species","larger species","humans cooking methods","domestic poultry","deer","villagers","peccaries","hunting activities","different livestock diseases","spread of diseases","raw meat","common forms of cooking","wild birds","chickens","exposure of meat","participatory epidemiological methods","pigs","wild animal populations","different pathogens","risk factor","protective factor","avian influenza","generated information","interrelationship of people","ELISA test","HI test","rainy season","dry season","following study","Guatemala","grilling","wildlife","tepezcuintle","Community Forestry Concession of Uaxact\u00FAn","mechanical vectors","roasting","favoured method","transmission of zoonoses","better understanding","contrast","knowledge","antibody detection","lack of employment opportunities","poverty","overall prevalence","broths","armadillos","hunters","stews","main focus","intention","evident health problems","samples","high temperatures","activity","chance","relevance","seasons","Newcastle disease","cloaca","ducks","time","year","BACKGROUND","pork","Stewing","viewpoint","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","difference","virus"],"language":"en"},

Here, we review the Lujo VHF outbreak of 2008 and discuss how preparatory measures with respect to developing diagnostic capacity might be effectively embedded into existing national disease control networks, such as those for human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria.","publish_time":"2016-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simulundu, Edgar; Mweene, Aaron S.; Changula, Katendi; Monze, Mwaka; Chizema, Elizabeth; Mwaba, Peter; Takada, Ayato; Ippolito, Guiseppe; Kasolo, Francis; Zumla, Alimuddin; Bates, Matthew","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a5f5151e75f16e9c2202a0c46a37547c6c4cc0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169100.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593704/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern Africa","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["Lujo virus","Lujo VHF outbreak","unprecedented Ebola virus disease outbreak","recent Zika virus disease epidemic","human immunodeficiency virus","existing national disease control networks","West Africa","Southern Africa","effective control","index case","viral infections","viral hemorrhagic fever","high case fatality rate","novel Old World arenavirus","nosocomial transmission","primary infection","Americas","arthropod","diagnosis","cause","time","pathogenic outbreaks of zoonotic","need","preparedness","respect","diagnostic capacity","acute focus","preparatory measures","tuberculosis","key determinant","malaria","cases"],"language":"en"},

Certain inflammatory disorders may be due in part to an impaired innate immune system that does not respond to acute bacterial damage in a timely fashion. Because the human FPR is encoded by a large number of different haplotypes arising from ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we examined the possibility that some of these haplotypes are functionally distinct. We analyzed the response of three common FPR haplotypes to peptides from Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, and human mitochondria. All three haplotypes responded similarly to the E. coli and mitochondrial peptides, whereas one required a higher concentration of the M. avium peptide fMFEDAVAWF for receptor downregulation, receptor signaling, and chemotaxis. This raises the possibility of additional bacterial species differences in functional responses among FPR variants and establishes a precedent with potentially important implications for our innate immune response against bacterial infections. We also investigated whether certain FPR haplotypes are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by sequencing FPR1 from 148 Caucasian individuals. The results suggested that FPR haplotypes do not significantly contribute toward RA.","publish_time":"2008-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gripentrog, Jeannie M.; Mills, John S.; Saari, George J.; Miettinen, Heini M.","journal":"Immunogenetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8581a31f67dbd6d888fe28abaa0bb0b243658a3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4b4d33846a57634f142195560773fc4e8ff367e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2435592.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00251-008-0277-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18253729/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["FPR","RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["certain FPR haplotypes","common FPR haplotypes","human FPR","FPR variants","bacterial source","bacterial infections","acute bacterial damage","mitochondrial peptides","large number of different haplotypes","receptor downregulation","possibility of additional bacterial species differences","innate immune response","mitochondrial N-formylated peptides","avium peptide fMFEDAVAWF","chemoattractant neutrophil formyl peptide receptor","Mycobacterium avium","Escherichia coli","impaired innate immune system","human mitochondria","site of tissue damage","Certain inflammatory disorders","functional responses","paratuberculosis","rheumatoid arthritis","sequencing FPR1","important implications","precedent","higher concentration","timely fashion","neutrophils","single-nucleotide polymorphisms","Caucasian individuals","chemotaxis","results"],"language":"en"},

About 15% of the patients have developed severe pneumonia, and about 6% need noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support. Currently, there are about 1000 patients who need ventilatory support and another 120 new patients daily who require noninvasive or invasive ventilation support in Wuhan city; however, there are only about 600 ICU beds [4]. To address this shortfall, 70 ICU beds were created from general beds and the government quickly transformed three general hospitals to critical care hospitals with a total of about 2500 beds that specialize in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (equipped with monitors and high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilator or invasive ventilators). An equally great (or potentially greater) problem is the shortage of trained personnel to treat these critically ill patients. Until the crisis, there were about 300 ICU physicians and 1000 ICU nurses in Wuhan city. By the end of January, more than 600 additional ICU doctors and 1500 ICU nurses were transferred to Wuhan from the rest of China. As well, an additional 3000 staff including infectious disease, respiratory, internal medicine physicians and nurses were transferred to Wuhan by the government. There are logistical issues which make care of the patients difficult. These include donning of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, respiratory and eye protection), lack of instruments and disposables, and shortages of supplemental oxygen. Many severe hypoxemic patients only receive high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rather than invasive mechanical ventilation because of intubation delay or lack of mechanical ventilators (especially at early phase). Our preliminary data show that only about 25% of patients who died were intubated and received mechanical ventilation.JO - Intensive Care Medicine","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Jianfeng; Tong, Zhaohui; Guan, Xiangdong; Du, Bin; Qiu, Haibo; Slutsky, Arthur S.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b747dd12ec11da6ac79a29c9775a578dac354700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123994/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-020-05979-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission","ICU","JO - Intensive Care Medicine"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ICU beds","new patients","ICU nurses","ill patients","patients difficult","ICU physicians","severe hypoxemic patients","noninvasive mechanical ventilation","Wuhan city","invasive ventilation support","lack of mechanical ventilators","invasive ventilators","invasive ventilatory support","additional ICU doctors","general beds","critical care hospitals","noninvasive ventilator","Lack of critical care resource","severe pneumonia","Intensive Care Medicine","high-flow nasal oxygen","lack of instruments","general hospitals","government","high-flow nasal cannula","internal medicine physicians","severe SARS-CoV","new confirmed cases","suspected cases","preliminary data","rest of China","shortages of supplemental oxygen","National Health Commission of China","HFNO","intubation delay","infectious disease","gloves","face of COVID","eye protection","problem","gowns","disposables","monitors","shortage of trained personnel","donning of personal protective equipment","staff","past week","total","epidemics","early phase","logistical issues","shortfall","crisis","end"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant PPV NIa protease expressed and purified from Escherichia coli demonstrated efficient and specific processing of recombinant GFP and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, with site F (N V V V H Q\u25BEA) for PPV NIa protease artificially inserted between the fusion tags and the target proteins. Its catalytic capability is similar to those of TVMV and TEV NIa protease. Recombinant PPV NIa protease reached its maximal proteolytic activity at approximately 30\u00B0C. Salt concentration and only one of the tested protease inhibitors had minor influences on the proteolytic activity of PPV NIa protease.

Although there are several studies to evaluate the efficacy of drugs against CHIKV, the treatment for chikungunya fever is mainly symptom-based and no effective licensed vaccine or antiviral are available. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of three types of flavonoids against CHIKV in vitro replication. Three compounds: silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were evaluated for their in vitro antiviral activities against CHIKV using a CHIKV replicon cell line and clinical isolate of CHIKV of Central/East African genotype. A cytopathic effect inhibition assay was used to determine their activities on CHIKV viral replication and quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to calculate virus yield. Antiviral activity of effective compound was further investigated by evaluation of CHIKV protein expression using western blotting for CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and E2E1 proteins. Briefly, silymarin exhibited significant antiviral activity against CHIKV, reducing both CHIKV replication efficiency and down-regulating production of viral proteins involved in replication. This study may have important consequence for broaden the chance of getting the effective antiviral for CHIKV infection.","publish_time":"2015-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lani, Rafidah; Hassandarvish, Pouya; Chiam, Chun Wei; Moghaddam, Ehsan; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Rausalu, Kai; Merits, Andres; Higgs, Stephen; Vanlandingham, Dana; Abu Bakar, Sazaly; Zandi, Keivan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43c284998733a1d7cc474d14c378f08e4b509c63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4468427.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26078201/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep11421","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV nsP1","CHIKV infection","CHIKV viral replication","CHIKV replication efficiency","clinical isolate of CHIKV","effective antiviral","antiviral activities","CHIKV replicon cell line","evaluation of CHIKV protein expression","significant antiviral activity","Antiviral activity of effective compound","chikungunya fever","chikungunya virus","silymarin","effective licensed vaccine","production of viral proteins","clinical presentations","E2E1 proteins","virus yield","western blotting","quantitative reverse transcription PCR","debilitating arthritis","nsP3","small joint pain","symptom","treatment","types of flavonoids","East African genotype","crippling pains","kaempferol","chance","efficacy of drugs","cytopathic effect inhibition assay","weeks","important consequence","quercetin","compounds","mosquito","study","studies","years"],"language":"en"},

Most of the published literature comprises nonanatomical and segmental resections with only few case series having major hepatic resections performed by minimally invasive approach. Aim of this article is to share our technique and experience of total laparoscopic major hepatectomy. METHODS: It is a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of 56 patients, who underwent laparoscopic major hepatectomy for various indications during 2001 to 2013. RESULTS: Of 56 patients operated, 37 had malignant disease and 19 had benign lesions with mean size of 6.0 \u00B1 2.8 cm. Thirty-four patients underwent right hepatectomy and 22 left with mean age of 54.8 \u00B1 15.3 years. Mean operating time was 227.4 \u00B1 51.8 min with mean blood loss 265.5 \u00B1 143.4 ml and transfusion needed in 10.7 %. Pringle\u2019s maneuver was used in 19.6 % with mean occlusion time of 34.0 \u00B1 11.4 min. Liver-specific complications were observed in 12.5 % and overall complications in 19.6 %. Mean resection margin length in malignant lesions was 2.1 \u00B1 0.9 cm, with \u003C1 cm margin noted in 5.4 %. Median hospital stay was 8 days (6\u201329) with readmission rate of 8.9 %, re-intervention rate of 5.3 % and 90 days mortality of 1.7 %. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic major liver resection is a formidable task. It requires considerable expertise in both, advanced laparoscopy, and liver surgery. It can be feasible, safe, and oncologically adequate in well-selected cases in experience hands.","publish_time":"2015-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palanisamy, Senthilnathan; Sabnis, Sandeep C.; Patel, Nikunj D.; Nalankilli, V.

Within three years, it developed from a consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy. In 2014, the H2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme (INFRAS projects) provided support for the transformation of the EVA from a European to a global organization (EVAg).

During that time we investigated the clinical features, treatment, and nursing care of 36 patients and reported on 12 of these patients\u0027 perceptions of their illness experience. Purpose The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical features, treatment, nursing care and perceptions of the illness experience of patients with SARS in Hong Kong in order to better inform nurses caring for patients with this highly contagious and potentially lethal disease. Method We abstracted data from the medical and nursing records on the clinical features, treatment and nursing care of 36 patients (21 women, 15 men) in whom SARS was diagnosed and who were admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between March 15 and April 15, 2003. A review of the hospital\u0027s policy and procedures on infection control was also undertaken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the patients to elicit their perceptions of the illness experience. Findings The most common symptoms were cough (83%), dyspnea (80.6%), malaise (69.4%) and fever (61%). Less common symptoms included headache (38.9%), diarrhea (38.9%), dizziness (30.6%), myalgia (25%), chills (19.4%), nausea and vomiting (19.4%) and rigor (the occurrence of a sensation of hot-and-cold and shivering in addition to teeth chattering and bed shaking) (8.3%). All 36 patients received a combination of corticosteroids and ribavirin. The patients were at risk of drug-related adverse reactions and deterioration of respiratory function, and nursing vigilance was required. Conclusion Nursing patients with SARS was challenging as the disease was highly contagious and potentially lethal, and not much was known about this disease. In addition to the use of frontline treatment, infection control and sensitivity to individual responses to sudden and catastrophic illness were required to support these patients. From this outbreak of SARS, we have learned the importance of infection control in containing and controlling the disease. Other lessons included the need to strengthen the surge capacity in our hospitals and support health care workers during the crisis.","publish_time":"2003-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tiwari, Agnes; Chan, Sophia; Wong, Alan; Tai, Josepha; Cheng, Karen; Chan, Judy; Tsang, Kenneth","journal":"Nursing Outlook","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a828f1e1f9945004e4155881bca952ac2a16baeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125875.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029655403001763; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0029655403001763","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Conclusion Nursing patients","illness experience of patients","nursing care","nursing records","nursing vigilance","outbreak of SARS","clinical features","Hong Kong","lethal disease","catastrophic illness","importance of infection control","use of frontline treatment","support health care workers","patients\u0027 perceptions","addition","common symptoms","purpose","outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","deterioration of respiratory function","individual responses","sensitivity","related adverse reactions","hospitals","risk of drug","hospital\u0027s policy","procedures","past year","surge capacity","cough","data","crisis","Queen Mary Hospital","order","sensation of hot","rigor","occurrence","need","Abstract Background","review","teeth","headache","Findings","combination of corticosteroids","article","nurses","women","malaise","Semi-structured interviews","chills","myalgia","nausea","dizziness","vomiting","diarrhea","dyspnea","ribavirin","Method","bed","time","fever","lessons"],"language":"en"},

It has been established that Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) interacts with sialylated molecules such as gangliosides and glycoproteins at the cell surface. Nevertheless, the specific receptor(s) that mediate virus entry are not well known. We have analysed the role of the sialic acid linkage in the early steps of the viral infection cycle. Pretreatment of ELL-0 cells with both \u03B12,3 and \u03B12,6 specific sialidases led to the inhibition of NDV binding, fusion and infectivity, which were restored after \u03B12,3(N)- and \u03B12,6(N)-sialyltransferase incubation. Moreover, \u03B12,6(N)-sialyltransferases also restored NDV activities in \u03B12-6-linked sialic acid deficient cells. Competition with \u03B12-6 sialic acid-binding lectins led to a reduction in the three NDV activities (binding, fusion and infectivity) suggesting a role for \u03B12-6- linked sialic acid in NDV entry. We conclude that both \u03B12-3- and \u03B12-6- linked sialic acid containing glycoconjugates may be used for NDV infection. NDV was able to efficiently bind, fuse and infect the ganglioside-deficient cell line GM95 to a similar extent to that of its parental MEB4, suggesting that gangliosides are not essential for NDV binding, fusion and infectivity. Nevertheless, the fact that the interaction of NDV with cells deficient in N-glycoprotein expression such as Lec1 was less efficient prompted us to conclude that NDV requires N-linked glycoproteins for efficient attachment and entry into the host cell.

Variability is uneven across the genome because mutations resulting in a deleterious effect on viral fitness are restricted. RNA viruses are thus marked by protein sites permissive to multiple mutations and sites critical to viral structure-function that are evolutionarily robust and highly conserved. Identification and characterization of the historical dynamics of the conserved sites have relevance to multiple applications, including potential targets for diagnosis, and prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe a large-scale identification and analysis of evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid sequences of the entire dengue virus (DENV) proteome, with a focus on sequences of 9 amino acids or more, and thus immune-relevant as potential T-cell determinants. DENV protein sequence data were collected from the NCBI Entrez protein database in 2005 (9,512 sequences) and again in 2007 (12,404 sequences). Forty-four (44) sequences (pan-DENV sequences), mainly those of nonstructural proteins and representing \u223C15% of the DENV polyprotein length, were identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences. Of these 44 sequences, 34 (\u223C77%) were present in \u226595% of sequences of each DENV type, and 27 (\u223C61%) were conserved in other Flaviviruses. The frequencies of variants of the pan-DENV sequences were low (0 to \u223C5%), as compared to variant frequencies of \u223C60 to \u223C85% in the non pan-DENV sequence regions. We further showed that the majority of the conserved sequences were immunologically relevant: 34 contained numerous predicted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertype-restricted peptide sequences, and 26 contained T-cell determinants identified by studies with HLA-transgenic mice and/or reported to be immunogenic in humans. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Forty-four (44) pan-DENV sequences of at least 9 amino acids were highly conserved and identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences, and the majority were found to be immune-relevant by their correspondence to known or putative HLA-restricted T-cell determinants. The conservation of these sequences through the entire recorded DENV genetic history supports their possible value for diagnosis, prophylactic and/or therapeutic applications. The combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches applied herein provides a framework for large-scale and systematic analysis of conserved and variable sequences of other pathogens, in particular, for rapidly mutating viruses, such as influenza A virus and HIV.","publish_time":"2008-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Asif M.; Miotto, Olivo; Nascimento, Eduardo J.

Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) has caused several epizootics in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) but is not associated with any human disease. In late 2008, REBOV infections were identified in swine for the first time in the Philippines. METHODS: A total of 215 swine sera collected at two REBOV-affected farms in 2008, in Pangasinan and Bulacan, were tested for the presence of REBOV-specific antibodies using multiple serodiagnosis systems. A total of 98 swine sera collected in a non-epizootic region, Tarlac, were also tested to clarify the prevalence of REBOV infection in the general swine population in the Philippines. RESULTS: Some 70 % of swine sera at the affected farms were positive for REBOV antibodies in the multiple serodiagnosis systems. On the other hand, none of the swine sera collected in Tarlac showed positive reactions in any of the diagnosis systems. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of REBOV infection in swine in the affected farms in 2008 suggests that swine is susceptible for REBOV infection. The multiple serological assays used in the study are thought to be useful for future surveillance of REOBV infection in swine in the Philippines.","publish_time":"2012-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sayama, Yusuke; Demetria, Catalino; Saito, Mariko; Azul, Rachel R; Taniguchi, Satoshi; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Iizuka, Itoe; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Kurane, Ichiro; Malbas, Fidelino F; Lupisan, Socorro; Catbagan, Davinio P; Animas, Samuel B; Morales, Rieldrin G; Lopez, Emelinda L; Dazo, Karen Rose C; Cruz, Magdalena S; Olveda, Remigio; Saijo, Masayuki; Oshitani, Hitoshi; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fd791accf9347c1e74f871c73b7d19c534059ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3433389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-82; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22709971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Philippines"],"keyphrases":["swine sera","REBOV antibodies","presence of REBOV","REBOV infections","high prevalence of REBOV infection","general swine population","affected farms","Philippines","multiple serodiagnosis systems","Tarlac","total","future surveillance of REOBV infection","non-human primates","multiple serological assays","specific antibodies","positive reactions","human disease","non-epizootic region","viral hemorrhagic fever","humans","Ebola viruses","epizootics","cynomolgus monkeys","Macaca fascicularis","BACKGROUND","study","Africa","CONCLUSIONS","Bulacan","Pangasinan","Reston ebolavirus","METHODS","time","hand","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A common mechanism of host recognition by viruses is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor. Bacteriophage Sf6, which infects Shigella flexneri, uses lipopolysaccharide as a primary receptor and then requires interaction with a secondary receptor, a role that can be fulfilled by either outer membrane proteins (Omp) A or C. Our previous work showed that specific residues in the loops of OmpA mediate Sf6 infection. To better understand Sf6 interactions with OmpA loop variants, we determined the kinetics of these interactions through the use of biolayer interferometry, an optical biosensing technique that yields data similar to surface plasmon resonance. Here, we successfully tethered whole Sf6 virions, determined the binding constant of Sf6 to OmpA to be 36 nM. Additionally, we showed that Sf6 bound to five variant OmpAs and the resulting kinetic parameters varied only slightly. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Sf6: Omp receptor recognition is not solely based on kinetics, but likely also on the ability of an Omp to induce a conformational change that results in productive infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hubbs, Natalia B.; Whisby-Pitts, Mareena M.; McMurry, Jonathan L.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d991e8d8754db8db0b2b0e01ae17df34653dcdfb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a6b05fa393f9404c906099e179ca476294068394.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/509141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shigella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sf6 infection","Sf6 interactions","Bacteriophage Sf6","Sf6 virions","binding constant of Sf6","Omp receptor recognition","primary receptor","secondary receptor","viruses","loops of OmpA","kinetics","productive infection","successful infection","common mechanism of host recognition","OmpA loop variants","respective host cells","data similar","optical biosensing technique","use of biolayer interferometry","specific residues","variant OmpAs","Shigella flexneri","surface plasmon resonance","resulting kinetic parameters","lipopolysaccharide","conformational change","model","previous work","outer membrane proteins","portion","ability","role","nM"],"language":"en"},

Here, we detail the historical basis linking infections to multiple sclerosis and review the epidemiology of the disease, which suggests a possible relationship with infectious agents. We also describe pathophysiologic studies in animals and other human demyelinating diseases that have demonstrated a variety of mechanisms by which infectious agents may induce chronic, relapsing central nervous system disease with myelin damage and relative preservation of axons, similar to multiple sclerosis. In addition, we discuss recent studies in individuals with multiple sclerosis indicating enhanced immune responses to infectious antigens, though not consistently demonstrating evidence for ongoing infection. Taken together, these studies suggest a role for infectious agents in the development of multiple sclerosis.

No epidemic has ever been truly predicted, rather than being merely noticed when it was already ongoing. Modelling the future course of an epidemic is similarly tenuous, as exemplified by ominous predictions during the last influenza pandemic leading to exaggerated national responses. The continuous evolution of microorganisms, the introduction of new pathogens into the human population and the interactions of a specific pathogen with the environment, vectors, intermediate hosts, reservoir animals and other microorganisms are far too complex to be predictable. Our environment is changing at an unprecedented rate, and human-related factors, which are essential components of any epidemic prediction model, are difficult to foresee in our increasingly dynamic societies. Any epidemiological model is, by definition, an abstraction of the real world, and fundamental assumptions and simplifications are therefore required. Indicator-based surveillance methods and, more recently, Internet biosurveillance systems can detect and monitor outbreaks of infections more rapidly and accurately than ever before. As the interactions between microorganisms, humans and the environment are too numerous and unexpected to be accurately represented in a mathematical model, we argue that prediction and model-based management of epidemics in their early phase are quite unlikely to become the norm.","publish_time":"2014-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neuberger, A.; Paul, M.; Nizar, A.; Raoult, D.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff436e03eff3591e5e9ea0b6a2910e0120471232.json; document_parses/pdf_json/735f16512dc187e8d6db112b11d7ddf047838f86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128462.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23879334/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14630007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14630007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["environment","epidemic prediction model","epidemiological model","mathematical model","model-based management of epidemics","interactions","continuous evolution of microorganisms","human population","human-related factors","Modelling of infectious diseases","Indicator-based surveillance methods","vectors","influenza pandemic","essential components","intermediate hosts","introduction of new pathogens","real world","reservoir animals","early phase","unprecedented rate","specific pathogen","fundamental assumptions","Internet biosurveillance systems","exaggerated national responses","ominous predictions","definition","humans","monitor outbreaks of infections","simplifications","abstraction","future course","dynamic societies","norm"],"language":"en"},

Remdesivir has already been tested for Ebola virus disease treatment and found to have activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The remdesivir core contains GS-441524, which interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases alone. In non-human primates, following IV administration, remdesivir is rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2 h to the active nucleoside triphosphate form, while GS-441524 is detectable in plasma for up to 24 h. Nevertheless, remdesivir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans are still unexplored, highlighting the need for a precise analytical method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification. OBJECTIVES: The validation of a reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification in human plasma. METHODS: Remdesivir and GS-441524 standards and quality controls were prepared in plasma from healthy donors. Sample preparation consisted of protein precipitation, followed by dilution and injection into the QSight 220 UHPLC-MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was obtained through an Acquity HSS T3 1.8 \u03BCm, 2.1 \u00D7 50 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile with 0.05% formic acid. The method was validated using EMA and FDA guidelines. RESULTS: Analyte stability has been evaluated and described in detail. The method successfully fulfilled the validation process and it was demonstrated that, when possible, sample thermal inactivation could be a good choice in order to improve biosafety. CONCLUSIONS: This method represents a useful tool for studying remdesivir and GS-441524 clinical pharmacokinetics, particularly during the current COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Avataneo, Valeria; de Nicol\u00F2, Amedeo; Cusato, Jessica; Antonucci, Miriam; Manca, Alessandra; Palermiti, Alice; Waitt, Catriona; Walimbwa, Stephen; Lamorde, Mohammed; di Perri, Giovanni; D\u2019Avolio, Antonio","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1102a68fa2d32e4b983128f44445a82e0982ac5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197584.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaa152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361744/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Remdesivir"],"organizations":["SARS","HSS","EMA","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GS","remdesivir pharmacokinetics","remdesivir core","MS method","MS system","human plasma","reliable UHPLC-MS","precise analytical method","treatment of COVID","quantification","clinical pharmacokinetics","current COVID","Sample preparation","RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","validation process","SARS-CoV","sample thermal inactivation","non-human primates","Ebola virus disease treatment","good choice","activity","potential application","active nucleoside triphosphate form","significant attention","QSight","protein precipitation","quality controls","useful tool","acetonitrile","Acquity HSS T3","\u03BCm","dilution","injection","need","administration","pharmacodynamics","humans","standards","gradient of water","column","order","biosafety","MERS coronaviruses","EMA","BACKGROUND","formic acid","Chromatographic separation","FDA guidelines","healthy donors","RESULTS","Analyte stability","outbreak","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","PBMCs","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The continued characterization of the nsps of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus has not only corroborated several important functional predictions, but also revealed various novel features of arteriviral replication. For porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), based on bioinformatics predictions and experimental studies, a processing map for the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins has been developed. Crystal structures have been resolved for two of the PRRSV nonstructural proteins that possess proteinase activity (nsp1\u03B1 and nsp4). The functional characterization of the key enzymes for arterivirus RNA synthesis, the nsp9 RNA polymerase and nsp10 helicase, has been initiated. In addition, progress has been made on nsp functions relating to the regulation of subgenomic mRNAs synthesis (nsp1), the induction of replication-associated membrane rearrangements (nsp2 and nsp3), and an intriguing replicative endoribonuclease (nsp11) for which the natural substrate remains to be identified. The role of nsps in viral pathogenesis and host immunity is also being explored, and specific nsps (including nsp1\u03B1/\u03B2, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7, and nsp11) have been implicated in the modulation of host immune responses to PRRSV infection. The nsp3\u20138 region was identified as containing major virulence factors, although mechanistic information is scarce. The biological significance of PRRSV nsps in virus-host interactions and the technical advancements in engineering the PRRSV genome by reverse genetics are also reflected in recent developments in the area of vaccines and diagnostic assays.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Ying; Snijder, Eric J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d02563440cffe40a3cd47fcdf3e2a5d7f3b9acb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114499.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.07.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210002765; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210002765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20696193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV genome","PRRSV infection","biological significance of PRRSV nsps","PRRSV nonstructural proteins","role of nsps","specific nsps","arterivirus RNA synthesis","virus-host interactions","arterivirus replicase gene","host immunity","nsp2","nsp1\u03B1","nsp4","nsp11","nsp3","functional characterization","respiratory syndrome virus","equine arteritis virus","important functional predictions","induction of replication","modulation of host immune responses","recent developments","bioinformatics predictions","recent years","continued characterization","nsp9 RNA polymerase","pp1ab replicase polyproteins","regulation of subgenomic mRNAs synthesis","various novel features of arteriviral replication","processing map","associated membrane rearrangements","key enzymes","proteinase activity","technical advancements","mechanistic information","major virulence factors","area of vaccines","experimental studies","viral pathogenesis","reverse genetics","nsp10 helicase","nsp7","intriguing replicative endoribonuclease","nsp functions","progress","diagnostic assays","region","knowledge","natural substrate","Crystal structures","addition"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we demonstrate that FLAV and HPV do not contain pseudogenes in this region, but encode three small functional proteins designated as U1\u2013U3 that apparently arose by gene duplication.

Although the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil may be beneficial during a chronic inflammatory illness, the same antiinflammatory properties can suppress the inflammatory responses necessary to combat acute viral infection. Given that (n-3) fatty acid-rich fish oil supplementation is on the rise and with the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic, we tested the effect of fish oil feeding for 2 wk on the immune response to influenza virus infection. Male C57BL/6 mice fed either a menhaden fish oil/corn oil diet (4 g fish oil:1 g corn oil, wt:wt at 5 g/100 g diet) or a control corn oil diet were infected with influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 and analyzed for lung pathology and immune function. Although fish oil-fed mice had lower lung inflammation compared with controls, fish oil feeding also resulted in a 40% higher mortality rate, a 70% higher lung viral load at d 7 post infection, and a prolonged recovery period following infection. Although splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity was suppressed in fish oil-fed mice, lung NK activity was not affected. Additionally, lungs of infected fish oil-fed mice had significantly fewer CD8(\u002B) T cells and decreased mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1-\u03B1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, and interleukin-6. These results suggest that the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil feeding can alter the immune response to influenza infection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2009-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwerbrock, Nicole M.

After implementation of prevention and control measures, the estimation of the epidemic trend is needed. A phase- and region-adjusted SEIR model was applied for modeling and predicting the number of cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province and regions outside Hubei Province in China. The estimated number of infections could reach its peak in late February 2020 in Wuhan and Hubei Province, which is 55 303\u201384 520 and 83 944\u2013129 312, respectively, while the epidemic peaks in regions outside Hubei Province in China could appear on February 13, 2020 with the estimated 13 035\u201319 108 cases. According to the estimation, the outbreak would abate in March and April all over China. Current estimation provided evidence for planned work resumption under stringent prevention and control in China to further support the fight against the epidemic. Nevertheless, there is still possibility of the second outbreak brought by the work resumption and population migration, especially from Hubei Province and high intensity cities outside Hubei Province. Strict prevention and control measures still need to be considered in the regions with high intensity of epidemic and densely-populated cities.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Ruijie; Wang, Huwen; Zhang, Shuxian; Wang, Zezhou; Dong, Yinqiao; Tsamlag, Lhakpa; Yu, Xiaoyue; Xu, Chen; Yu, Yuelin; Long, Rusi; Liu, Ning-Ning; Chu, Qiao; Wang, Ying; Xu, Gang; Shen, Tian; Wang, Suping; Deng, Xiaobei; Huang, Jinyan; Zhang, Xinxin; Wang, Hui; Cai, Yong","journal":"Front Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/249908dfd0b9780c7e13be6f79e4f36fb8850a0b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32279219/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-020-0768-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["Hubei Province","China","regions","Wuhan","outbreak","high intensity of epidemic","control measures","epidemic peaks","epidemic trend","stringent prevention","high intensity cities","implementation of prevention","Strict prevention","Current estimation","number of cases","planned work resumption","estimated number of infections","populated cities","evidence","modeling","population migration","region-adjusted SEIR model","phase","coronavirus disease","fight","possibility","areas"],"language":"en"},

Several well-established methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the \u2018art of the possible\u2019, which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for \u2018good practice\u2019 for the development and the use of predictive models.","publish_time":"2011-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woolhouse, Mark","journal":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95cff929be1b2765e78d6293e4722f404a814011.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3130384.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2010.0387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk modelling","predictive modelling","mouth disease","dynamic modelling","undoubted success of quantitative modelling","infectious disease outbreak","quantitative analyses","quantitative approaches","underlying drivers of disease risks","use of predictive models","control of human","risk factor analysis","behaviour","epidemiology","animal diseases","accepted guidelines","AIDS","influenza","role","development","demography","considerable room","good practice","outputs","improvement","likelihood","foot","well-established methodologies","policy makers","starting point","climate change","BSE","attention","research effort","areas","stakeholders","holistic framework","time","predictions"],"language":"en"},

A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese adults from March 29 to April 07, 2020. A 13- and 15- items structured questionnaire assessed the COVID-19 related knowledge and perception of the universal safety measure. Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and Mann\u2013Whitney U test evaluated the differences in knowledge between the groups. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Of the 884 surveys accessed, a total of 871 consented (electronically) and completed the online survey (response rate 98.52%). The median knowledge score of the participants was 10.0 (\u00B1 3.0 IQR). Although participants\u2019 overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission. Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19. A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants\u2019 age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income. This study found optimal knowledge and perception of universal safety measures of COVID-19 among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed.

Although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route, it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between HCoVs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases. Furthermore, pathological features have not been clear. Till now, our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is limited.

Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV\u2019s capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV. IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Yushun; Shang, Jian; Graham, Rachel; Baric, Ralph S.; Li, Fang","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d15d874af3185180b5f3ed49b42b8a476d677043.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081895.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00127-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV RBM","nCoV RBD","nCoV infections","SARS-CoV outbreak","nCoV spike protein","human ACE2","receptor interactions","human transmissions of SARS","CoV research","SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain","receptor recognition","goals of SARS","host receptor angiotensin","potential receptor usage","species-specific receptor usage","receptor-binding motif","human cell infection","animal origin","diversity of animal species","potential animal hosts","key interactions","animal models of viruses","novel insights","novel coronavirus","cross-species","host cell infectivity","favorable interactions","key atomic-level interactions","predictive insights","predictive framework","cell entry","likely host range","epidemic surveillance","reiterative framework","enzyme","critical residues","released sequence","study","atomic-level iterative framework of virus","recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus","extensive structural analyses","structural studies","nCoV\u2019s capacity","bat origin","humans similar","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","possible intermediate hosts","public health research communities","rats","Gln493","China","symptoms","robust test","IMPORTANCE","mice","preventive measures","rich knowledge","phylogenetic analysis","Asn501","decade","world","alert"],"language":"en"},

Objectives (1) Determine the overall incidence of RTIs in a daycare cohort using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (2) Determine the relative incidence and impact of specific respiratory viruses, and characterize and compare clinical features associated with these pathogens. Study design In this prospective cohort study conducted from February 2006 to April 2008, nasal swabs were obtained from symptomatic children ages 0\u201330 months enrolled in fulltime daycare. RT-PCR was performed to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza (Flu) viruses A and B, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (CoV) and rhinovirus (RhV). Symptom diaries were completed for each illness. Results We followed 119 children (mean age 10 months; range 2\u201324 months) for 115 child years. The mean annual incidence of RTI per child was 4.2 the first year and 1.2 the second year of the study. At least 1 virus was identified in 67% RTIs. Co-infections were common (27% RTIs), with RhV, CoV, and AdV the most common co-pathogens. PIV was identified in 12% of RTIs with a high incidence of PIV4. The viruses with the greatest impact on our population were RSV, RhV and AdV. Conclusions Using molecular techniques, viruses were identified in approximately twice as many RTIs as previously reported in a daycare cohort. Infections with newly identified viruses, such as HMPV and CoV subtypes were less frequent and severe than infections with RSV, AdV and RhV.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fairchok, Mary P.; Martin, Emily T.; Chambers, Susan; Kuypers, Jane; Behrens, Melinda; Braun, LoRanee E.; Englund, Janet A.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cefb291db795ee819d5069fbad1cdebb3563843.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108368.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.06.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20650679/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321000257X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321000257X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified viruses","AdV","daycare cohort","RhV","overall incidence of RTIs","RSV","months","Co-infections","impact of specific respiratory viruses","prospective cohort study","relative incidence","fulltime daycare","epidemiology of respiratory tract infections","CoV subtypes","respiratory syncytial virus","mean annual incidence of RTI","high incidence of PIV4","RT-PCR","Study design","common co-pathogens","molecular techniques","human metapneumovirus","human coronaviruses","greatest impact","mean age","child years","symptomatic children ages","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","adenovirus","HMPV","population","Abstract Background","parainfluenza","range","rhinovirus","nasal swabs","Conclusions","clinical features","Symptom diaries","illness","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

We first establish the asymptotic normality for quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) of the parameters under the condition that the error distribution has finite fourth moment. For the case of heavy-tailed errors, we propose a least absolute deviations estimation (LADE) for PTTGARCH ( p , q ) model, and prove that the LADE is asymptotically normally distributed under very weak moment conditions. This paves the way for a statistical inference based on asymptotic normality for heavy-tailed PTTGARCH ( p , q ) models. As a consequence, we can construct the Wald test for GARCH structure and discuss the order selection problem in heavy-tailed cases. Numerical results show that LADE is more accurate than QMLE for heavy-tailed errors. Furthermore, the theory is applied to the daily returns of the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index, which suggests that asymmetry and nonlinearity could be present in the financial time series and the PTTGARCH model is capable of capturing these characteristics. As for the probabilistic structure of PTTGARCH ( p , q ) model, we give in the appendix a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a strictly stationary solution of the model, the existence of the moments and the tail behavior of the strictly stationary solution.","publish_time":"2008-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Jiazhu; Wang, Hui; Tong, Howell","journal":"Journal of Econometrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91b2621b4fe5e2c563e9a6ba5cb585b3eaf97cd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116990.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407607001443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287880/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304407607001443","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LADE","QMLE"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["PTTGARCH model","standard GARCH model","heavy-tailed PTTGARCH","GARCH structure","threshold GARCH","heavy-tailed errors","heavy-tailed cases","moment structure","probabilistic structure of PTTGARCH","case of heavy","asymptotic normality","QMLE","existence","models","stationary solution","weak moment conditions","sufficient condition","class of power","special cases","natural generalization of power","quasi-maximum likelihood estimators","order selection problem","Hong Kong Hang Seng Index","Box","daily returns","financial time series","Cox","tail behavior","error distribution","statistical inference","asymmetry","parameters","finite","appendix","moments","PTTGRACH","Wald test","nonlinearity","absolute deviations estimation","Stationarity","Hwang","Statistics","Probability Letters","way","theory","Abstract","Basawa","characteristics","processes","Numerical results","consequence"],"language":"en"},

The laboratory isolated a gram-negative bacillus, raising concerns that it might be tularemia or plague; ultimately, it was identified as an acinetobacter species and was considered to be a contaminant. Because no other such cases were reported at the time, the case was thought to be merely an isolated event. However, within two weeks, on June 2, 2003, evidence of a much wider scenario began to emerge. On that date, the Wisconsin DPH received notice from the Marshfield Laboratory that the mother of the first patient had become ill on May 26 and that electron-microscopic evidence of a poxvirus was found in a skin lesion. On that same day, another report, this time from the Milwaukee Health Department, of a strange illness was received at the DPH and described the case of a meat inspector who resided in southeastern Wisconsin and also was a distributor of exotic animals. By July 30, 2003, 72 confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox had been reported in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana and represented a large outbreak. The peak in the onset of illness occurred between May 29 and June 9, 2003, and no further cases of illness have been reported in humans since June 22, 2003.

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs\u2014Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)\u2014each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. Main methods In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. Significance The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elfiky, Abdo A.","journal":"Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc2bd2b0da8367f981d384c8d7da5d44b53e73d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102646.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117592; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520303404?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520303404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32222463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":["Wuhan City","China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","spread of SARS","anti-RdRp drugs","potent drugs","different anti-polymerase drugs","new human coronavirus","results","new virus","strain","deaths","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","mysterious new viral infection COVID","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","availability of FDA","emerged coronavirus","animal-human barrier","seeds","Galidesivir","HCoVs","effectiveness of Ribavirin","high potential","antiviral treatments","Sofosbuvir","danger","study","Tenofovir","YAK","Remdesivir","China","pneumonia","IDX","guanosine derivative","world","MERS","market","patients","Wuhan City","Setrobuvir","addition","Key findings","Abstract","Main methods","confirmed infections","countries","various viruses","Significance","toxicity measurements","coronaviruses","years","approval","disease"],"language":"en"},

We describe the organization and results of the network, known as ECMOnet. METHODS: The network consisted of 14 ICUs with ECMO capability and a national call center. The network was set up to centralize all severe patients to the ECMOnet centers assuring safe transfer. An ad hoc committee defined criteria for both patient transfer and ECMO institutions. RESULTS: Between August 2009 and March 2010, 153 critically ill patients (53% referred from other hospitals) were admitted to the ECMOnet ICU with suspected H1N1. Sixty patients (48 of the referred patients, 49 with confirmed H1N1 diagnosis) received ECMO according to ECMOnet criteria. All referred patients were successfully transferred to the ECMOnet centers; 28 were transferred while on ECMO. Survival to hospital discharge in patients receiving ECMO was 68%. Survival of patients receiving ECMO within 7 days from the onset of mechanical ventilation was 77%. The length of mechanical ventilation prior to ECMO was an independent predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A network organization based on preemptive patient centralization allowed a high survival rate and provided effective and safe referral of patients with severe H1N1-suspected ARDS.

More recently, multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR were used to enable more broad-range testing based on panels of suspected pathogens. PCR\u2013electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) has emerged as a technology that is capable of identifying nearly all known human pathogens either from microbial isolates or directly from clinical specimens. Assay primers are strategically designed to target one or more of the broad pathogen categories: bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or viral. With broad-range amplification followed by detection of mixed amplicons, the method can identify genetic evidence of known and unknown pathogens. This unique approach supports a higher form of inquiry, asking the following question: What is the genetic evidence of known or unknown pathogens in the patient sample? This approach has advantages over traditional assays that commonly target the presence or absence of one or more pathogens with known genetic composition.

Their primary structure is characterised by an N-terminal, triple-helical collagenous region made up of Gly-X-Y repeats, an a-helical coiled-coil trimerising neck region, and a C-terminal C-type lectin or carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Further oligomerisation of this primary structure can give rise to more complex and multimeric structures that can be seen under electron microscope. Collectins can be found in serum as well as in a range of tissues at the mucosal surfaces. Mannanbinding lectin can activate the complement system while other members of the collectin family are extremely versatile in recognising a diverse range of pathogens via their CRDs and bring about effector functions designed at the clearance of invading pathogens. These mechanisms include opsonisation, enhancement of phagocytosis, triggering superoxidative burst and nitric oxide production. Collectins can also potentiate the adaptive immune response via antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells through modulation of cytokines and chemokines, thus they can act as a link between innate and adaptive immunity.

Many different vaccination protocols are applied in the same region and even in consecutive cycles on the same farm in order to find the perfect balance between costs and benefits. In Northern Italy, the usual second vaccination is more and more often moved up to the chick\u0027s first d of life. The second strain administration together with the common Mass priming by spray at the hatchery allows saving money and time and reducing animal stress. The present work compared the different vaccine strains (Mass-like or B48, and 1/96) kinetics both in field conditions and in a 21-day-long experimental trial in broilers, monitoring the viral replication by upper respiratory tract swabbing and vaccine specific real time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) quantification. In both field and experimental conditions, titers for all the vaccines showed an increasing trend in the first 2 wk and then a decrease, though still remaining detectable during the whole monitored period. IBV field strain and avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV) presence also was also investigated by RT-PCR and sequencing, and by multiplex real-time RT-PCR, respectively, revealing a consistency in the pathogen introduction timing at around 30 d, in correspondence with the vaccine titer\u0027s main decrease. These findings suggest the need for an accurate knowledge of live vaccine kinetics, whose replication can compete with the other pathogen one, providing additional protection to be added to what is conferred by the adaptive immune response.","publish_time":"2017-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tucciarone, C M; Franzo, G; Berto, G; Drigo, M; Ramon, G; Koutoulis, K C; Catelli, E; Cecchinato, M","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee17beb088764da5cee76084ffb093fb4b4ff396.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107209.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29077954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time RT-PCR","field conditions","different vaccine strains","IBV field strain","vaccine specific real time reverse transcription PCR","vaccine titer\u0027s main decrease","costs","experimental conditions","accurate knowledge of live vaccine kinetics","different vaccination protocols","viral replication","strain administration","experimental trial","d of life","common Mass priming","pathogen introduction timing","upper respiratory tract","productive losses","spray","hatchery","avian Metapneumovirus","great economic burden","saving money","broilers","aMPV","correspondence","perfect balance","farm","order","need","vaccines","presence","day","consistency","present work","titers","sequencing","consecutive cycles","control strategies","animal stress","Infectious bronchitis virus","increasing trend","region","Northern Italy","wk","benefits","B48","quantification","adaptive immune response","monitored period","findings","additional protection","chick\u0027s"],"language":"en"},

Data on the phenomenon of intermittent positive results for MERS-CoV on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with negative results in between are lacking. Here we describe cases with intermittent positive MERS-CoV test results and highlight the required number of tests to rule out or rule in MERS-CoV infection based on a large retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV. Methods This analysis included cases admitted between January 2014 and December 2017. The included patients had a minimum of 3 nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests for confirmation and needed 2 negative samples for MERS-CoV evaluated 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization apart to ensure clearance. Results A total of 408 patients with positive MERS-CoV test results were treated at the referring hospital. We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs. Of the total cases, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test then a negative test, followed by positive test results. Conclusions Our data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV. In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfaraj, Sarah H.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13bfa7a8290098863360920e13cd2c76b12456a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352694/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665531830871X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665531830871X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.08.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Background Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","confirmed MERS-CoV","intermittent positive MERS-CoV test results","positive test results","negative results","nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests","phenomenon of intermittent positive results","highest yield of positive results","negative test","included patients","negative samples","clear patients","nasopharyngeal samples","nasopharyngeal swabs","consecutive swabs","total cases","large retrospective cohort of patients","hours","stabilization","clinical improvement","yield of sputum samples","Data","rule","required number of tests","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","confirmation","minimum","system","Evaluation","effectiveness","addition","initial years","referring hospital","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","disease","Methods","analysis","clearance","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Bioaerosol is a multidisciplinary research subject, involving many different fields such as microbiology, mechanical engineering, air pollution, medical science, epidemiology, immunological science, biochemistry, physics, nanotechnologies and etc. The bioaerosol field has undergone about 200 years\u0027 research history since 1833 when mold spores were first detected in the air by Charles Darwin on the Cape Verde Islands. In recent decades, there has been a research boom in bioaerosol field, thus triggering many outstanding research opportunities. Visible progress has already been made in understanding bioaerosol roles in human health, atmospheric and ecological impacts as well as their respective technologies: bioaerosol capture, monitoring and also inactivation. Most recently, researchers from different fields start to bridge together for solving bioaerosol challenges and addressing key scientific problems, e.g., bioaerosol spread, real-time detection, indoor microbes, human bioaerosol emissions, and bio-defense. Toward this effort, a \u201CBioaerosol Xiangshan Science Conference-the 600th\u201D has been successfully held in the summer in Beijing, China. A total of 47 scientists and funding agency officials including leading bioaerosol experts from overseas were invited and two-day long extensive discussions on bioaerosol progress and problems were carried out. Future bioaerosol directions have been outlined by the attendees during the conference. Some of the participants have also contributed to this bioaerosol special issue. This special issue consists of a total of 20 bioaerosol articles from eight countries including one review, and contributes to the advances in bioaerosol emission, transmission, health effects, ambient bioaerosols, method development and instrumentation, and control. Through this special issue, the bioaerosol community has obtained a better understanding of bioaerosol health risks and developed the corresponding strategies to confront the threats.

As in other coronaviruses, nucleocapsid (N) is one of the most crucial structural components of the SARS-CoV. Hence major attention has been focused on characterization of this protein. Independent studies conducted by several laboratories have elucidated significant insight into the primary function of this protein, which is to encapsidate the viral genome. In addition, many reports also suggest that this protein interferes with different cellular pathways, thus implying it to be a key regulatory component of the virus too. In the first part of this review, we will discuss these different properties of the N-protein in a consolidated manner. Further, this protein has also been proposed to be an efficient diagnostic tool and a candidate vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Hence, towards the end of this article, we will discuss some recent progress regarding the possible clinically relevant use of the N-protein.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Surjit, Milan; Lal, Sunil K.","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b694e233e30a6df59c27f0982c5f9126e934926.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106238.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134807001025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134807001025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-protein","SARS-CoV","discovery of SARS","different properties","different cellular pathways","candidate vaccine","relevant use","laboratories","significant insight","recent progress","efficient diagnostic tool","primary function","year","crucial structural components","numerous researchers","key regulatory component","characterization","consolidated manner","article","major attention","Independent studies","world","coronaviruses","nucleocapsid","reports","viral genome","addition","biology","review"],"language":"en"},

However, there are marked geographical disparities in capacity for early detection of outbreaks, which limit the effectiveness of global surveillance strategies. Linking surveillance approaches for emerging and neglected endemic zoonoses, with a renewed focus on existing disease problems in developing countries, has the potential to overcome several limitations and to achieve additional health benefits. Poor reporting is a major constraint to the surveillance of both emerging and endemic zoonoses, and several important barriers to reporting can be identified: (i) a lack of tangible benefits when reports are made; (ii) a lack of capacity to enforce regulations; (iii) poor communication among communities, institutions and sectors; and (iv) complexities of the international regulatory environment. Redirecting surveillance efforts to focus on endemic zoonoses in developing countries offers a pragmatic approach that overcomes some of these barriers and provides support in regions where surveillance capacity is currently weakest. In addition, this approach addresses immediate health and development problems, and provides an equitable and sustainable mechanism for building the culture of surveillance and the core capacities that are needed for all zoonotic pathogens, including emerging disease threats.","publish_time":"2012-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halliday, Jo; Daborn, Chris; Auty, Harriet; Mtema, Zacharia; Lembo, Tiziana; Bronsvoort, Barend M. deC.; Handel, Ian; Knobel, Darryn; Hampson, Katie; Cleaveland, Sarah","journal":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59532e3fbb23c6bca0ad86898cdf50817b38633f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3427560.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22966142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance capacity","culture of surveillance","surveillance approaches","surveillance efforts","endemic zoonoses","effective surveillance of emerging infectious diseases","emerging disease threats","effectiveness of global surveillance strategies","lack of capacity","Early detection of disease outbreaks","existing disease problems","developing countries","early detection of outbreaks","Poor reporting","additional health benefits","lack of tangible benefits","development problems","immediate health","pragmatic approach","renewed focus","poor communication","important barriers","human","animal populations","regions","zoonotic pathogens","major constraint","complexities","sectors","communities","institutions","limitations","regulations","geographical disparities","support","sustainable mechanism","core capacities","international regulatory environment","reports","potential"],"language":"en"},

The best examples are the recurring outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya fever in tropical and sub-tropical regions, the recent epidemic of Zika in the Americas and the Caribbean, and the SARS, MERS, and influenza A outbreaks across the globe. The established natural reservoirs of human viruses are mainly farm animals, and, to a lesser extent, wild animals and arthropods. The intricate \u201Chost-pathogen-environment\u201D relationship remains the key to understanding the emergence/re-emergence of pathogenic viruses. High population density, rampant constructions, poor sanitation, changing climate, and the introduction of anthropophilic vectors create selective pressure on host-pathogen reservoirs. Nevertheless, the knowledge and understanding of such zoonoses and pathogen diversity in their known non-human reservoirs are very limited. Prevention of arboviral infections using vector control methods has not been very successful. Currently, new approaches to protect against food-borne infections, such as consuming only properly cooked meats and animal products, are the most effective control measures. Though significant progress in controlling human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis viruses has been achieved, the unpredictable nature of evolving viruses and the rare occasions of outbreaks severely hamper control and preventive modalities.","publish_time":"2017-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parvez, Mohammad K.; Parveen, Shama","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1104f2b79381b4e98fccd7f1294599956ebca90d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179518.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28772262/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000478729","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Americas","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["host-pathogen reservoirs","established natural reservoirs of human viruses","human health","hepatitis viruses","known non-human reservoirs","human immunodeficiency virus","pathogen diversity","re-emergence of pathogenic viruses","unpredictable nature of evolving viruses","recurring outbreaks of dengue","rare occasions of outbreaks","vector control methods","deadly viral infections","effective control measures","Prevention of arboviral infections","extraordinary progress","significant progress","wild animals","sub-tropical regions","area of biomedical knowledge","chikungunya fever","selective pressure","rampant constructions","recent epidemic of Zika","poor sanitation","introduction of anthropophilic vectors","High population density","climate","environment","animal products","lesser extent","Caribbean","key","Americas","arthropods","influenza","MERS","relationship","zoonoses","Incidences of emerging","best examples","cooked meats","SARS","food","preventive modalities","new approaches","globe"],"language":"en"},

Here we use a SARS-CoV infection-reinfection ferret model and a functional genomics approach to gain insight into SARS immunopathogenesis and to identify correlates of immune protection during SARS-CoV-challenge in ferrets previously infected with SARS-CoV or immunized with a SARS virus vaccine. We identified gene expression signatures in the lungs of ferrets associated with primary immune responses to SARS-CoV infection and in ferrets that received an identical second inoculum. Acute SARS-CoV infection prompted coordinated innate immune responses that were dominated by antiviral IFN response gene (IRG) expression. Reinfected ferrets, however, lacked the integrated expression of IRGs that was prevalent during acute infection. The expression of specific IRGs was also absent upon challenge in ferrets immunized with an inactivated, Al(OH)(3)-adjuvanted whole virus SARS vaccine candidate that protected them against SARS-CoV infection in the lungs. Lack of IFN-mediated immune enhancement in infected ferrets that were previously inoculated with, or vaccinated against, SARS-CoV revealed 9 IRG correlates of protective immunity.

However, much has been learned about how to best use our critical antibacterial agents in ways to avoid or even repair some of the resistance damage that has been done. A compilation of current literature strongly suggests that to slow the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents it is optimal to use drugs with more than one mechanism of action or target, to prescribe those with demonstrated ability to minimise or reverse resistance problems, and to avoid underdosing of potent antibiotics. The most recent information also indicates that it is best to limit empirical use of \u03B2-lactam plus fluoroquinolone combination therapy, since these two classes activate some common resistance responses, and using them together can facilitate multidrug resistance in important pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. This review discusses the role of each major antimicrobial class on resistance development and presents specific strategies for combating the growing problem of multidrug-resistant bacteria. We now have the knowledge to better manage our antimicrobial agent prescribing practices, but finding the will and resources to apply our understanding remains a formidable challenge.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peterson, L.

Conversely, histopathology has contributed to advances in our understanding of disease, leading directly to novel and more effective treatments. New infections, some involving histopathology in their discovery, have also led to fresh diagnostic challenges. Increasingly, patients have benefited from fundamental changes in professionalism in pathology. Through audit, external quality assurance, continuing professional development, standardized reporting, and increasing specialization, the consistency and reliability of histopathological diagnoses have steadily improved.

RECENT FINDINGS: Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic have opened the door for investigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. SUMMARY: Each current vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is paramount that multiple strategies be advanced quickly and then evaluated for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the safety studies to minimize undesired immunopotentiation will become the most significant bottleneck in terms of time.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Strych, Ulrich; Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena","journal":"Curr Trop Med Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9077423f925951898cae6412d7bf0e68b482cf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094941.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219057/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV vaccines","COVID","vaccine concepts","vaccine technologies","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","virus vaccines","current vaccine strategy","nucleic acid vaccines","vaccine target product profile","recombinant protein subunit vaccines","safety studies","Previous research efforts","careful safety evaluations","causative agent of coronavirus disease","undesired immunopotentiation","previous experience","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","vaccinating at-risk human populations","frontline healthcare workers","individuals","investigators","distinct advantages","approaches","significant bottleneck","increased infectivity","RECENT FINDINGS","door","disadvantages","high degree of genetic similarity","timely overview","host cell ACE2 receptor","eosinophilic infiltration","terms of time","pandemic","epidemic","goal","SUMMARY","years","chronic conditions","multiple strategies","China","efficacy"],"language":"en"},

This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Memish, Ziad A; Perlman, Stanley; Van Kerkhove, Maria D; Zumla, Alimuddin","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5ace18191f3c38909720e5805118250b750e0c8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2c0bb9026a52285a6115d6d32102e5aad52f4e69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7155742.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145185/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673619332210; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673619332210; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(19)33221-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Riyadh","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","cases of MERS","MERS epidemiology","CoV infection","nosocomial outbreaks of MERS","human transmission","high-threat pathogen","priority pathogen","Saudi Arabia","deaths","high mortality rate","Intermittent sporadic cases","lethal zoonotic pathogen","Large outbreaks of human","infection control","improved management","mode of transmission","clinical features","community clusters","research","pathogenesis","epidemic potential","diagnosis","perspectives","virology","development of new therapeutics","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","current knowledge","severe disease","unanswered questions","vaccines","priorities","Jeddah","update","humans","medical countermeasures","prevention","Jordan","South Korea","Riyadh","Seminar","majority","countries"],"language":"en"},

Tannins are known for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties in the gastro-enteric tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the oral administration of chestnut tannins (Castanea sativa Mill.) in order to reduce the duration of calf neonatal diarrhea. Twenty-four Italian Friesian calves affected by neonatal diarrhea were included. The duration of the diarrheic episode (DDE) was recorded and the animals were divided into a control group (C), which received Effydral\u00AE in 2 l of warm water, and a tannin-treated group (T), which received Effydral\u00AE in 2 l of warm water plus 10 g of extract of chestnut tannins powder. A Mann-Whitney test was performed to verify differences for the DDE values between the two groups. RESULTS: The DDE was significantly higher in group C than in group T (p = 0.02), resulting in 10.1 \u00B1 3.2 and 6.6 \u00B1 3.8 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Phytotherapic treatments for various diseases have become more common both in human and in veterinary medicine, in order to reduce the presence of antibiotic molecules in the food chain and in the environment. Administration of tannins in calves with diarrhea seemed to shorten the DDE in T by almost 4 days compared to C, suggesting an effective astringent action of chestnut tannins in the calf, as already reported in humans. The use of chestnut tannins in calves could represent an effective, low-impact treatment for neonatal diarrhea.","publish_time":"2018-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonelli, F.; Turini, L.; Sarri, G.; Serra, A.; Buccioni, A.; Mele, M.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4897212ecb3c7d659bda8a992f12f63d3abad13e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6064112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30055618/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1549-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Administration of tannins","Neonatal calf diarrhea","chestnut tannins powder","use of chestnut tannins","group C","duration of calf neonatal diarrhea","group T","oral administration of chestnut tannins","effective astringent action of chestnut tannins","control group","DDE values","tannin-treated group","warm water","order","Effydral","days","Italian Friesian calves","common disease","g of extract","bovine practice","low-impact treatment","various diseases","food chain","anti-inflammatory properties","presence of antibiotic molecules","Castanea sativa","CONCLUSIONS","Phytotherapic treatments","gastro-enteric tract","differences","infectious agents","substantial economic losses","veterinary medicine","diarrheic episode","animals","BACKGROUND","Mann-Whitney test","study","environment","groups","RESULTS","aim","humans"],"language":"en"},

Although efficient N-N interactions require the presence of RNA, we found that M-M interactions were RNA-independent. SARS-CoV M was observed in both the Golgi area and plasma membranes of a variety of cells. Blocking M glycosylation does not appear to significantly affect M plasma membrane labeling intensity, M-containing vesicle release, or VLP formation. Results from a genetic analysis indicate involvement of the third transmembrane domain of M in plasma membrane-targeting signal. Fusion proteins containing M amino-terminal 50 residues encompassing the first transmembrane domain were found to be sufficient for membrane binding, multimerization, and Golgi retention. Surprisingly, we found that fusion proteins lacking all three transmembrane domains were still capable of membrane binding, Golgi retention, and interacting with M.

To replicate, (\u002B)RNA viruses exploit host resources and modify host metabolism and membrane organization. Phospholipase D (PLD) is a phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing enzyme that catalyzes the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid second messenger that modulates diverse intracellular signaling in various organisms. PA is normally present in small amounts (less than 1% of total phospholipids), but rapidly and transiently accumulates in lipid bilayers in response to different environmental cues such as biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. However, the precise functions of PLD and PA remain unknown. Here, we report the roles of PLD and PA in genomic RNA replication of a plant (\u002B)RNA virus, Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV). We found that RCNMV RNA replication complexes formed in Nicotiana benthamiana contained PLD\u03B1 and PLD\u03B2. Gene-silencing and pharmacological inhibition approaches showed that PLDs and PLDs-derived PA are required for viral RNA replication. Consistent with this, exogenous application of PA enhanced viral RNA replication in plant cells and plant-derived cell-free extracts. We also found that a viral auxiliary replication protein bound to PA in vitro, and that the amount of PA increased in RCNMV-infected plant leaves.

The enzyme is a cysteine protease, with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145/His-41) in the active site. Aldehyde inhibitors can bind reversibly to the active-site sulfhydryl of SARS-CoV Mpro. Previous studies using peptidic substrates and inhibitors showed that the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV Mpro requires glutamine in the P1 position and a large hydrophobic residue in the P2 position. We determined four crystal structures of SARS-CoV Mpro in complex with pentapeptide aldehydes (Ac-ESTLQ-H, Ac-NSFSQ-H, Ac-DSFDQ-H, and Ac-NSTSQ-H). Kinetic data showed that all of these aldehydes exhibit inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV Mpro, with Ki values in the \u03BCM range. Surprisingly, the X-ray structures revealed that the hydrophobic S2 pocket of the enzyme can accommodate serine and even aspartic-acid side-chains in the P2 positions of the inhibitors. Consequently, we reassessed the substrate specificity of the enzyme by testing the cleavage of 20 different tetradecapeptide substrates with varying amino-acid residues in the P2 position. The cleavage efficiency for the substrate with serine in the P2 position was 160-times lower than that for the original substrate (P2=Leu); furthermore, the substrate with aspartic acid in the P2 position was not cleaved at all. We also determined a crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro in complex with aldehyde Cm-FF-H, which has its P1-phenylalanine residue bound to the relatively hydrophilic S1 pocket of the enzyme and yet exhibits a high inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV Mpro, with Ki =2.24\u00B10.58\u03BCM. These results show that the stringent substrate specificity of the SARS-CoV Mpro with respect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overruled by the highly electrophilic character of the aldehyde warhead, thereby constituting a deviation from the dogma that peptidic inhibitors need to correspond to the observed cleavage specificity of the target protease.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Lili; George, Shyla; Schmidt, Marco F.; Al-Gharabli, Samer I.; Rademann, J\u00F6rg; Hilgenfeld, Rolf","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecfb3c3040888f2ce3fffad5624f86bb261c7096.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114241.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211003901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854807/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211003901","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV Mpro","substrate specificity of SARS","P2 positions","crystal structures of SARS","crystal structure of SARS","P1 position","enzyme","stringent substrate specificity","active-site sulfhydryl of SARS","original substrate","Aldehyde inhibitors","Abstract SARS coronavirus main protease","FF-H","peptidic inhibitors","observed cleavage specificity","Ac-ESTLQ","Ac-NSFSQ","Ac-DSFDQ","Ac-NSTSQ","aspartic-acid","aspartic acid","target protease","complex","peptidic substrates","cysteine protease","P1-phenylalanine residue","serine","aldehyde warhead","cleavage efficiency","active site","large hydrophobic residue","high inhibitory activity","hydrophobic S2 pocket","varying amino-acid residues","pentapeptide aldehydes","Ki values","X-ray structures","\u03BCM range","different tetradecapeptide substrates","hydrophilic S1 pocket","major antiviral drug target","respect","deviation","glutamine","times lower","catalytic dyad","Previous studies","chains","Leu","electrophilic character","replication","dogma","results","Kinetic data"],"language":"en"},

RNA analysis from purified virions showed that the three defective RNAs were efficiently packaged. Virions of different densities containing either full-length or defective RNAs were sorted in sucrose gradients, indicating that defective and full-length genomes were independently encapsidated. DI-B and DI-C RNAs were amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced.

DI-B and DI-C RNAs include sequences with the pseudoknot motif and encoding the polymerase, metal ion binding, and helicase motifs. DI-B RNA has a structure closely related to DI-C RNA with two main differences: it maintains the entire ORF 1b and shows heterogeneity in the size of the 3\u2032 end deletion.

Many studies have since used the SARI case definition as inclusion criteria for surveillance studies. We sought to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI criteria for detecting ten different respiratory viruses in a Middle Eastern pediatric cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data for this study comes from a prospective acute respiratory surveillance study of hospitalized children \u003C2 years in Amman, Jordan from March 16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Participants were recruited if they had a fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained and tested by real-time RT-PCR for eleven viruses. Subjects meeting SARI criteria were determined post-hoc. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI case definition for detecting ten different viruses were calculated and results were stratified by age. RESULTS: Of the 3,175 patients enrolled, 3,164 were eligible for this study, with a median age of 3.5 months, 60.4% male, and 82% virus-positive (44% RSV and 3.8% flu). The sensitivity and specificity of the SARI criteria for detecting virus-positive patients were 44% and 77.9%, respectively. Sensitivity of SARI criteria for any virus was lowest in children \u003C3 months at 22.4%. Removing fever as a criterion improved the sensitivity by 65.3% for detecting RSV in children \u003C3 months; whereas when cough was removed, the sensitivity improved by 45.5% for detecting flu in same age group. CONCLUSIONS: The SARI criteria have poor sensitivity for detecting RSV, flu, and other respiratory viruses\u2014particularly in children \u003C3 months. Researchers and policy makers should use caution if using the criteria to estimate burden of disease in children.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klink, Thomas; Rankin, Danielle A.; Piya, Bhinnata; Spieker, Andrew J.; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Williams, John V.; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Halasa, Natasha B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b2e58c9fb494bf80226905af4db48accf619bcc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353012/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232188","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":["Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["Sensitivity of SARI criteria","inclusion criteria","Subjects meeting SARI criteria","positive predictive value","SARI case definition","poor sensitivity","months","different respiratory viruses","negative predictive value","respiratory symptoms","different viruses","virus-positive patients","RSV","specificity","prospective acute respiratory surveillance study of hospitalized children","Severe Acute Respiratory Infection","surveillance studies","median age","age group","fever","results","World Health Organization","Middle Eastern pediatric cohort","years","Amman","caution","influenza","real-time RT-PCR","Researchers","policy makers","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","data","related hospitalization","burden of disease","CONCLUSIONS","throat swabs","MATERIALS","Jordan","male","criterion","cough","Participants"],"language":"en"},

We benchmarked this approach using twelve crystal structures and showed that glycan geometries can be automatically improved while maintaining good fit to the crystallographic data.

An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported. Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea. Methods We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs. Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation. Conclusion Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms. The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u2019Amico, Ferdinando; Baumgart, Daniel C.; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent","journal":"Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7a4159ce5cead74ff87dc1199e3f461631adf96.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S154235652030481X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278065/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154235652030481X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conclusion Diarrhea"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","prevention of SARS","Conclusion Diarrhea","associated diarrhea","ACE2","confirmed diagnosis of SARS","incidence rate of diarrhea","increasing number of diarrhea cases","infected patients","overall percentage of diarrhea onset","Clinical studies","COVID","clinical presentation","respiratory symptoms","optimal methods","serine protease TMPRSS2","mechansism of intestinal inflammation","small intestinal epithelia","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","stool detectable longer time period","viral RNA shedding","need","molecular mechanisms","management","effective modification","frequent presenting symptom","screening","S protein priming","possible fecal oral transmission","binding affinity","nasopharyngeal swabs","subjects of intensive research","options","evidence","reports","EMBASE","epidemiology","angiotensin","diagnostic algorithms","Abstract Background","upper esophagus","pooled analysis","liver","colon","PubMed","pandemic","times","Web of Science","Current treatment","subject of investigation","worldwide emergency","lung","enzyme","infection"],"language":"en"},

We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR\u2014preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays\u2014and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing.

Using a pull down and mass spectrometric approach, we identified the ATP synthase subunit \u03B2 (ATP5B) to bind the HEV capsid protein. Its role in the entry of HEV was then validated using antibody and siRNA mediated approaches, and infectious HEV from the stools of a hepatitis E patient. Though ATP synthase is largely a mitochondrial protein, the cell surface expressed form of ATP5B is implicated in other viral infections.","publish_time":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Zulfazal; Holla, Prasida; Ahmad, Imran; Jameel, Shahid","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/060434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["HEV","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of HEV","infectious HEV","hepatitis E virus","HEV-LPs","HEV entry factor","HEV capsid protein","aspects of HEV biology","hepatitis E patient","high titer infectious virus","entry mechanism","hepatotropic non-enveloped RNA virus","mitochondrial protein","ATP synthase subunit \u03B2","cell surface expressed form of ATP5B","HSPGs","heparan sulfate proteoglycans","laboratory","siRNA mediated approaches","stools","particles","liver cells","attachment factors","causative agent","mass spectrometric approach","antibody","cellular receptor","absence","pull","culture","coli","contamination of drinking water","Previous studies","viral infections","role"],"language":"en"},

However, the OH approach is complex, and there is limited guidance available for investigators regarding the practical design and implementation of OH research. In this paper we provide a framework to guide researchers through conceptualizing and planning an OH study. We discuss key steps in designing an OH study, including conceptualization of hypotheses and study aims, identification of collaborators for a multi-disciplinary research team, study design options, data sources and collection methods, and analytical methods. We illustrate these concepts through the presentation of a case study of health impacts associated with land application of biosolids. Finally, we discuss opportunities for applying an OH approach to identify solutions to current global health issues, and the need for cross-disciplinary funding sources to foster an OH approach to research.","publish_time":"2017-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lebov, J.; Grieger, K.; Womack, D.; Zaccaro, D.; Whitehead, N.; Kowalcyk, B.; MacDonald, P.D.M.","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2029878b827294f1639d73575783c79c72007c40.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bdf14a6bd3df23e41d670416b6f0b345e1ebde7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5454183.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771416300696; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771416300696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616503/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2017.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OH study","OH approach","implementation of OH research","case study of health impacts","multidisciplinary research","study design options","today\u0027s complex health","environmental health questions","multi-disciplinary research team","current global health issues","need","practical design","data sources","cross-disciplinary funding sources","potential solutions","collection methods","environmental challenges","analytical methods","investigators","identification of collaborators","comprehensive understanding","animal","human","limited guidance available","conceptualization of hypotheses","problem","land application of biosolids","presentation","conceptualizing","holistic manner","framework","researchers","key steps","siloed approaches","concepts","opportunities","paper"],"language":"en"},

A particular concern is the potential for viral transmission by way of aerosol which may be generated during perioperative care. There are currently no guidelines for the conduct of elective lung resection surgery in this context. METHODS A working group composed of 1 thoracic surgeon, 2 anesthesiologists and 1 critical care specialist assessed the risk for aerosol during lung resection surgery and proposed steps for mitigation. After external review, a final draft was approved by the Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities of the H\u00F4pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, in Montreal, Canada. RESULTS The working group divided the risk for aerosol into 6 time-points: (1) intubation and extubation; (2) Lung isolation and patient positioning; (3) access to the chest; (4) conduct of the surgical procedure; (5) procedure termination and lung re-expansion; (6) chest drainage. Mitigating strategies were proposed for each time-point. CONCLUSIONS The situation with COVID-19 is an opportunity to re-evaluate operating room protocols both for the purposes of this pandemic and similar situations in the future. In the context of lung resection surgery, specific time points during the procedure seem to pose specific risks for the genesis of aerosol and thus should be the focus of attention.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rakovich, George; Urbanowicz, Robert; Issa, Rami; Wang, Han Ting","journal":"Annals of surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433293/; https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004087","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["context of lung resection surgery","conduct of elective lung resection surgery","Lung isolation","conduct of elective cancer surgery","way of aerosol","genesis of aerosol","surgical procedure","time-points","lung re-expansion","specific time points","procedure termination","pandemic","COVID","working group","perioperative care","viral transmission","specific risks","possibility of transmission","Surgical Activities","Governance of Perioperative","proposed steps","chest drainage","critical care specialist","purposes","H\u00F4pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont","potential","anesthesiologists","thoracic surgeon","final draft","operating room protocols","Montreal","opportunity","virus","Committee","similar situations","patient positioning","issue","mitigation","particular concern","requirement","external review","access","patients","asymptomatic carriers","future","setting","extubation","guidelines","need","Canada","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","intubation","Mitigating strategies","METHODS","focus of attention"],"language":"en"},

In the host, MAC also may induce channel formation to innocent bystander endothelial cells (ECs) and ECs cannot be protected. This provokes endotheliopathy, which activates two independent molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. Activated inflammatory pathway promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines and triggers inflammation. Activated microthrombotic pathway mediates platelet activation and exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) from ECs and initiates microthrombogenesis. Excessively released ULVWF become anchored to ECs as long elongated strings and recruit activated platelets to assemble platelet-ULVWF complexes and form \u201Cmicrothrombi\u201D. These microthrombi strings trigger disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT), which is the underlying pathology of endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD). Sepsis-induced endotheliopathy promotes inflammation and DIT. Inflammation produces inflammatory response and DIT orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a combined phenotype of inflammation and endotheliopathy-associated (EA)-VMTD.

Laboratory-confirmed influenza infections from a single surveillance hospital were then linked to the CMS entries to assess possible over- and under-diagnosis of influenza based on CMS codes alone. Influenza was recorded as any primary or any secondary diagnosis in 1.3% (1158/86,582) of infants aged above 6 days to below 6 months and 4.3% (20,230/471,482) of children above 6 days to below 18 years. The unadjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years based on any CMS diagnosis of influenza in all admission to Hong Kong public hospitals were 627 in the below 2 months of age group and 1762 in the 2 month to below 6 month group. Incidence of hospitalisation for influenza in children was highest from 2 months to below 6 months. In the absence of vaccines for children below 6 months of age, effective vaccination of pregnant women may have a significant impact on reducing influenza hospitalisations in this age group.","publish_time":"2014-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, E.

Pathogens/parasites consisting of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes from all groups have been associated with diseases from such organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Viral pathogens in particular, appear to be an increasingly important group and research into this group will likely highlight a larger number of diseases and pathogens being described in the near future.

However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs and flaccid intestines at necropsy.","publish_time":"2013-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kongsted, Hanne; Jonach, Beata; Haugegaard, Svend; Angen, \u00D8ystein; Jorsal, Sven E; Kokotovic, Branko; Larsen, Lars E; Jensen, Tim K; Nielsen, Jens P","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a46fb28bde7f183808bb47ec90ffd8d97511a73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3852778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119974/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome","NNPDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea","syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome","new syndrome","new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive","Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea","investigated herds","non-diarrhoeic piglets","investigated outbreaks","case piglets","diarrhoeal outbreaks","commercial swine herds","well-managed herds","NNPDS","following case-definition","stomachs","study","flaccid intestines","known pathogen","RESULTS","predominant histological lesions","preliminary piglet-level case-definition","Cryptosporidium spp","Giardia spp","Clostridium difficile","management factors","infectious pathogens","Epithelial lesions","microscopic findings","Clostridium perfringens type","common management practices","established laboratory conclusion","well-known enteric pathogens","Routine laboratory examinations","antibiotics","frequent clinical condition","coronavirus","Cystoisospora suis","villous atrophy","rotavirus","hypothesis","Strongyloides ransomi","jejunum","milk","week of life","detection","enterotoxigenic","coli","mucosal changes","hypotheses","ileum","necropsy","BACKGROUND","colon","microbiological examination","primary purpose","days","CONCLUSIONS","Faeces"],"language":"en"},

Nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV (SARS_NP) functions in enveloping the entire genomic RNA and interacts with viron structural proteins, thus playing important roles in the process of virus particle assembly and release. Protein\u2013protein interaction analysis using bioinformatics tools indicated that SARS_NP may bind to human cyclophilin A (hCypA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed this binding with the equilibrium dissociation constant ranging from 6 to 160nM. The probable binding sites of these two proteins were detected by modeling the three-dimensional structure of the SARS_NP\u2013hCypA complex, from which the important interaction residue pairs between the proteins were deduced. Mutagenesis experiments were carried out for validating the binding model, whose correctness was assessed by the observed effects on the binding affinities between the proteins. The reliability of the binding sites derived by the molecular modeling was confirmed by the fact that the computationally predicted values of the relative free energies of the binding for SARS_NP (or hCypA) mutants to the wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) are in good agreement with the data determined by SPR.

Based on our complete genome sequences of four isolates (BJ01-BJ04) of SARS-CoV from Beijing, China, we analyzed the structure and predicted functions of the R protein in comparison with 13 other isolates of SARS-CoV and 6 other coronaviruses. The entire ORF (open-reading frame) encodes for two major enzyme activities, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and proteinase activities. The R polyprotein undergoes a complex proteolytic process to produce 15 function-related peptides. A hydrophobic domain (HOD) and a hydrophilic domain (HID) are newly identified within NSP1. The substitution rate of the R protein is close to the average of the SARS-CoV genome. The functional domains in all NSPs of the R protein give different phylogenetic results that suggest their different mutation rate under selective pressure. Eleven highly conserved regions in RdRp and twelve cleavage sites by 3CLP (chymotrypsin-like protein) have been identified as potential drug targets. Findings suggest that it is possible to obtain information about the phylogeny of SARS-CoV, as well as potential tools for drug design, genotyping and diagnostics of SARS.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zuyuan; Zhang, Haiqing; Tian, Xiangjun; Ji, Jia; Li, Wei; Li, Yan; Tian, Wei; Han, Yujun; Wang, Lili; Zhang, Zizhang; Xu, Jing; Wei, Wei; Zhu, Jingui; Sun, Haiyan; Zhang, Xiaowei; Zhou, Jun; Li, Songgang; Wang, Jun; Wang, Jian; Bi, Shengli; Yang, Huanming","journal":"Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5172245.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1672022903010192; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022903010192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","SARS"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["R protein","SARS-CoV genome","non-structural protein","isolates of SARS","R polyprotein","phylogeny of SARS","diagnostics of SARS","different mutation rate","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA replication","RdRp","substitution rate","coronaviruses","potential drug targets","proteinase activities","drug design","potential tools","hydrophilic domain","hydrophobic domain","different phylogenetic results","major enzyme activities","complete genome sequences","fidelity","average","cleavage sites","complex proteolytic process","frame","regulation of transcription","NSPs","comparison","predicted functions","BJ01-BJ04","HOD","structure","CLP","chymotrypsin","selective pressure","China","conserved regions","function-related peptides","entire ORF","information","Beijing","ssRNA viruses","functional domains","replicase","Findings","NSP1"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, mounting evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed, prototypic mammarenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. Concerns about human-pathogenic mammarenaviruses are exacerbated by of the lack of licensed vaccines, and current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. Detailed understanding of virus/host-cell interactions may facilitate the development of novel anti-mammarenavirus strategies by targeting components of the host-cell machinery that are required for efficient virus multiplication. Here we document the generation of a recombinant LCMV encoding a nucleoprotein (NP) containing an affinity tag (rLCMV/Strep-NP) and its use to capture the NP-interactome in infected cells. Our proteomic approach combined with genetics and pharmacological validation assays identified ATPase Na(\u002B)/K(\u002B) transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) and prohibitin (PHB) as pro-viral factors. Cell-based assays revealed that ATP1A1 and PHB are involved in different steps of the virus life cycle. Accordingly, we observed a synergistic inhibitory effect on LCMV multiplication with a combination of ATP1A1 and PHB inhibitors. We show that ATP1A1 inhibitors suppress multiplication of Lassa virus and Candid#1, a live-attenuated vaccine strain of Jun\u00EDn virus, suggesting that the requirement of ATP1A1 in virus multiplication is conserved among genetically distantly related mammarenaviruses. Our findings suggest that clinically approved inhibitors of ATP1A1, like digoxin, could be repurposed to treat infections by mammarenaviruses pathogenic for humans.","publish_time":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iwasaki, Masaharu; Minder, Petra; Ca\u00EC, Y\u00EDngy\u00FAn; Kuhn, Jens H.; Yates, John R.; Torbett, Bruce E.; de la Torre, Juan C.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efbd0dfc426da5dd25ce29411d6fa37571623773.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5834214.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ATP1A1 inhibitors","multiplication of Lassa virus","efficient virus multiplication","LCMV multiplication","combination of ATP1A1","requirement of ATP1A1","approved inhibitors of ATP1A1","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","virus life cycle","Detailed understanding of virus","PHB inhibitors","mammarenaviruses pathogenic","human-pathogenic mammarenaviruses","related mammarenaviruses","humans","prototypic mammarenavirus","recombinant LCMV","live-attenuated vaccine strain of Jun\u00EDn virus","Strep-NP","host-cell interactions","host-cell machinery","NP-interactome","Cell-based assays","current anti-mammarenavirus therapy","development of novel anti-mammarenavirus strategies","pharmacological validation assays","label use of ribavirin","serious public health concerns","neglected human pathogen of clinical significance","components","cause hemorrhagic fevers","genetics","different steps","affinity tag","lack of licensed vaccines","prohibitin","ATPase Na","endemic regions","mammalian arenaviruses","synergistic inhibitory effect","rLCMV","nucleoprotein","Candid","pro-viral factors","proteomic approach","infected cells","digoxin","infections","subunit alpha","findings","generation","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Despite the wide array of diagnostic tools, invasive techniques, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), are often required to obtain adequate specimens. PneumoniaCheck(TM) is a new device that collects aerosol particles from cough, allowing microbiological analyses. Up to now it has been tested only for bacteria detection, but no study has investigated its usefulness for virus identification. Methods: In this pilot study we included 12 consecutive patients with pneumonia. After testing cough adequacy via a peak flow meter, a sampling with PneumoniaCheck(TM) was collected and a BAL was performed in each patient. Microbiological analyses for virus identification were performed on each sample and concordance between the two techniques was tested (sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values), taking BAL results as reference. Results: BAL was considered adequate in 10 patients. Among them, a viral pathogen was identified by PneumoniaCheck(TM) 6 times, each on different samples, whereas BAL allowed to detect the presence of a virus on 7 patients (14 positivities). Overall, the specificity for PneumoniaCheck(TM) to detect a virus was 100%, whereas the sensitivity was 66%. When considering only herpes viruses, PneumoniaCheck(TM) showed a lower sensitivity, detecting a virus in 1/4 of infected patients (25%). Conclusions: In this pilot study PneumoniaCheck(TM) showed a good correlation with BAL for non-herpes virologic identification in pneumonia patients, providing excellent specificity. Further studies on larger population are needed to confirm these results and define its place in the panorama of rapid diagnostic tests for lower respiratory tract infections.","publish_time":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patrucco, Filippo; Gavelli, Francesco; Ravanini, Paolo; Daverio, Matteo; Statti, Giulia; Castello, Luigi Mario; Andreoni, Stefano; Balbo, Piero Emilio","journal":"J Breath Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3497a84e0d8736a527ddf901055c1eb9b457abfc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106764.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7163/aaf010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523983/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TM","BAL results","virus identification","pilot study PneumoniaCheck","pneumonia patients","lower sensitivity","consecutive patients","infected patients","aetiology of lower respiratory tract infections","excellent specificity","microbiological analyses","non-herpes virologic identification","invasive techniques","herpes viruses","adequate specimens","testing cough adequacy","panorama of rapid diagnostic tests","wide array of diagnostic tools","peak flow meter","negative predictive values","good correlation","aerosol particles","new device","sampling","place","bronchoalveolar lavage","times","different samples","Background","Conclusions","usefulness","presence","larger population","viral pathogen","studies","concordance","bacteria detection","Methods","reference","positivities"],"language":"en"},

We here showed the genome landscape of a Vero cell line, in which 25,877 putative protein-coding genes were identified in the 2.97-Gb genome sequence. A homozygous \u223C9-Mb deletion on chromosome 12 caused the loss of the type I interferon gene cluster and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes in Vero cells. In addition, an \u223C59-Mb loss of heterozygosity around this deleted region suggested that the homozygosity of the deletion was established by a large-scale conversion. Moreover, a genomic analysis of Vero cells revealed a female Chlorocebus sabaeus origin and proviral variations of the endogenous simian type D retrovirus. These results revealed the genomic basis for the non-tumourigenic permanent Vero cell lineage susceptible to various pathogens and will be useful for generating new sub-lines and developing new tools in the quality control of Vero cells.","publish_time":"2014-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osada, Naoki; Kohara, Arihiro; Yamaji, Toshiyuki; Hirayama, Noriko; Kasai, Fumio; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Kuroda, Makoto; Hanada, Kentaro","journal":"DNA Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6525c7e5a16bc1ecd8fcdfda2cc6c82fe89c85c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4263300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25267831/; https://doi.org/10.1093/dnares/dsu029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genomic analysis of Vero cells","quality control of Vero cells","Continuous cell lines","non-tumourigenic permanent Vero cell lineage susceptible","various pathogens","various types of microbes","new tools","Mb deletion","production of various types of biological pharmaceuticals","important animal cell substrates","new sub-lines","Mb loss of heterozygosity","invaluable tools","production of vaccines","genomic basis","genome landscape","Gb genome sequence","putative protein-coding genes","cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes","endogenous simian type D retrovirus","proviral variations","female Chlorocebus sabaeus origin","interferon gene cluster","life sciences","mammalian tissues","deleted region","human use","homozygosity","toxins","chromosome","large-scale conversion","results","addition","microbiology"],"language":"en"},

We selected Yersiniabactin receptor of Escherichia coli UMN026 and Flagellin of Stenotrophomonas maltophila. B-cell linear epitopes were predicted using Bepipred prediction tool. Peptide binding with reference sets of 27 alleles of MHC class I and class II was also analyzed. The predicted peptides-MHC complexes were further validated using simulation dynamics. The in-silico construction of chimera was done by restriction mapping and codon optimization. Chimera was evaluated using the immunoinformatic approach as done for the selected proteins. From the 673 amino acids of FyuA protein, a region from 1 to 492 was selected for containing more linear epitopes and the processing scores obtained were significant for MHC class I and class II binding. Similarly, from Flagellin, a region between 60 and 328 amino acids was selected and the peptides present in the selected region showed lower percentile ranks for binding with MHC molecules. The simulation studies validated the predictions of peptide-MHC complexes. The selected gene fragments accommodating maximum part of these peptides were used to design a chimaeric construct of 2454 bp. From the immunoinformatic analysis, the chimera was found to be more immunogenic in terms of increased number of B-cell and T-cell epitopes along with increased coverage of global populations with allelic variability.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Ashutosh; Harjai, Kusum; Chhibber, Sanjay","journal":"Human Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c40e0bbb4b43900b06fe7717b8a41e181a8607e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115567.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2019.02.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885918309868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769032/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198885918309868","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chimera"],"organizations":["Escherichia","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selected region","selected proteins","alleles of MHC class","predicted peptides-MHC complexes","MHC molecules","selected gene fragments","B-cell linear epitopes","Peptide binding","peptides present","T-cell epitopes","immunoinformatic approach","immunogenic proteins","infections","silico construction of chimera","terms of increased number of B","predictions of peptide","amino acids of FyuA protein","simulation studies","chimeric construct","simulation dynamics","immunoinformatic analysis","chimaeric construct","Flagellin of Stenotrophomonas maltophila","increased coverage of global populations","current study reverse vaccinology approach","antibiotic resistance genes","leading cause of community","Yersiniabactin receptor of Escherichia coli UMN026","lower percentile","processing scores","reference sets","allelic variability","restriction mapping","Abstract Enterobacterial pathogens","hospital","Bepipred prediction tool","better option","codon optimization","situation vaccination"],"language":"en"},

They are also asymptomatic hosts for numerous viruses, including recently emerged zoonotic Henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, which are highly pathogenic for humans and other mammals. Better understanding of how bats control viral infection requires development of relevant permissive cellular experimental models. By applying a somatic reprogramming protocol to Pteropus bat primary cells, using a novel combination of ESRRB, CDX2, and c-MYC transcription factors, we generated bat reprogrammed cells exhibiting stem cell-like characteristics and a neural stem cell-like molecular signature. These cells present a unique interferon-stimulated transcriptomic signature and both produce and respond to interferon type-I, highlighting differences between stem cells from bats and other mammals.

Plants have the potential to mass-produce pharmaceutical products with less cost than traditional methods. Tobacco-derived antibodies have been tested and used to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Genetically engineered immunoadhesin (DPP4-Fc) produced in green plants has been shown to be able to bind to MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), preventing the virus from infecting lung cells.

Conversion of endoscopy units to COVID units and redeployment of gastroenterology (GI) fellows and faculty has profoundly changed the profile of most GI services. Meanwhile, consult and procedural volumes have been drastically reduced. In this review we share our collective experiences, how we have changed our practice of medicine, in response to the COVID surge. While we will review our management of specific consults and conditions, the overarching theme focuses primarily on non-invasive measures and maximizing medical therapies. Endoscopic procedures have been reserved for those timely interventions that are most likely to be therapeutic. The role of multidisciplinary discussion, while always important, has now become critical. And the support of our faculty and trainees remains essential. Local leadership can encourage well-being by frequent team check-ins and foster trainee development through remote learning.

Understanding the prevalence of diseases, in relation to age and breed, would support appropriate guidance for future health care strategies and provide useful information for the early diagnosis of diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the major medical causes for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea, stratified by age and breed. METHODS: A total of 15,531 medical records of canine patients were analyzed from 11 veterinary clinics who shared data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. An electronic medical record (EMR) system was used for data collection, which included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information, and diagnosis. EMR data were classified using the International Classification of Disease system from the World Health Organization; presenting signs or diagnoses were identified according to breed and life stage. RESULTS: Within the age groups, preventive medicine (16.7% confidence intervals (CI) [15.9\u201317.5]) was the most common cause for clinic visits for the \u003C1 year and 1\u20133 year groups. Additionally, neutering surgery (6.6% CI [6.0\u20137.1]) and patella luxation (1.4% CI [1.8\u20132.7]) were frequently performed in these age groups. In the 4\u20136 year group, otitis externa (8.8% CI [7.8\u201310.0]) and dermatitis or eczema (8.5% CI [7.5\u20139.6]) were common medical problems. In older dogs (\u003E10 year), the prevalences of heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing\u2019s disease, and mammary tumors were higher than in the other age groups. Small and toy breed dogs comprised 67.7% of all dogs in this analysis. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems. DISCUSSION: This study identified the most common medical disorders and differences in prevalences of diseases, according to age and breeds. The information from EMRs for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics can provide background knowledge that is required to enable a better understanding of disease patterns and occurrence by age and breeds. The information from this study could enable the creation of strategies for preventing diseases and enable the identification of health problems for more effective disease management in companion dogs.","publish_time":"2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Eunju; Choe, Changyong; Yoo, Jae Gyu; Oh, Sang-Ik; Jung, Younghun; Cho, Ara; Kim, Suhee; Do, Yoon Jung","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64a2b883a0ce91110c5cd56722520d862476ba3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6035722.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMR","World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["age groups","toy breed dogs","disease prevalence","companion dogs","common medical problems","Cushing\u2019s disease","kidney disease","older dogs","year groups","common medical disorders","prevalences of heart disease","effective disease management","veterinary clinics","prevalences of diseases","prevalence of diseases","study","breeds","International Classification of Disease system","better understanding of disease patterns","identification of health problems","major medical causes","electronic medical record","useful information","clinical information","common cause","EMR data","early diagnosis of diseases","future health care strategies","medical records of canine patients","otitis externa","data collection","eczema","dermatitis","World Health Organization","creation of strategies","background knowledge","animal identification number","gender","appropriate guidance","neuter status","greatest risk factors","mortality","occurrence","preventive medicine","differences","mammary tumors","Republic of Korea","signs","confidence intervals","total","clinic visits","diagnoses","diarrhea","relation","EMRs","neutering surgery","patella luxation","life stage","METHODS","RESULTS","purpose","DISCUSSION","analysis"],"language":"en"},

The circulating pattern and genetic characteristics in the HRSV attachment glycoprotein gene were investigated in Turkey during six consecutive seasons from 2009 to 2015. HRSVA was dominant in the all epidemic seasons except 2011\u20102012 season. Partial sequences of the HVR2 region of the G gene of 479 HRSVA and 135 HRSVB were obtained. Most Turkish strains belonged to NA1, ON1, and BA9, which were the predominant genotypes circulating worldwide. Although three novel genotypes, TR\u2010A, TR\u2010BA1, and TR\u2010BA2, were identified, they were not predominant. Clinical data were available for 69 HRSV\u2010positive patients who were monitored due to acute lower respiratory tract illness. There were no significant differences in the clinical diagnosis, hospitalization rates, laboratory findings and treatment observed between the HRSVA and HRSVB groups, and co\u2010infections in this study. The major population afflicted by HRSV infections included infants and children between 13 and 24 months of age. We detected that the CB1, GB5, and THB strains clustered in the same branch with a bootstrap value of 100%. CB\u2010B and BA12 strains clustered in the same branch with a bootstrap value of 65%. The BA11 genotype was clustered in the BA9 genotype in our study. The present study may contribute on the molecular epidemiology of HRSV in Turkey and provide data for HRSV strains circulating in local communities and other regions worldwide.","publish_time":"2017-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bayrakdar, Fatma; Kocabas, Can Naci; Altas, Ayse Basak; Kavuncuoglu, H.

However, the role of nsp15 in coronavirus replication was enigmatic as EndoU-deficient coronaviruses were viable and replicated to near wild-type virus levels in fibroblast cells. A breakthrough in our understanding of the role of EndoU was revealed in recent studies, which showed that EndoU mediates the evasion of viral double-stranded RNA recognition by host sensors in macrophages. This new discovery of nsp15/EndoU function leads to new opportunities for investigating how a viral EndoU contributes to pathogenesis and exploiting this enzyme for therapeutics and vaccine design against pathogenic coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xufang; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35916b6f331804f4aeeb9713543ef533b2455970.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5869138.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29307596/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217304373; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217304373; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.12.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral EndoU","Coronavirus EndoU","role of EndoU","EndoU function","EndoU-deficient coronaviruses","coronavirus replication","role of nsp15","viral replication complex","new discovery of nsp15","coronavirus endoribonuclease","enzymatic nature of nsp15","unique replication cycle of viruses","new opportunities","pathogenic coronaviruses","structural studies","recent studies","evasion of viral double-stranded RNA recognition","near wild-type virus levels","therapeutics","host sensors","vaccine design","fibroblast cells","evolving story","enzyme","macrophages","pathogenesis","sequence of nonstructural protein","order Nidovirales","component","understanding","breakthrough"],"language":"en"},

The cellular protein GBF1 is critical for poliovirus replication. Here we show that the contribution of GBF1 to virus replication is different from its known activities in uninfected cells. Normally GBF1 activates the Arf GTPases necessary for formation of COPI transport vesicles. GBF1 function is modulated by p115 and Rab1b. However, in polio-infected cells, p115 is degraded and neither p115 nor Rab1b knock-down affects virus replication. Poliovirus infection is very sensitive to BFA, an inhibitor of Arf activation by GBF1. BFA targets the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1. Nevertheless the BFA block of polio replication is rescued by expression of only the N-terminal region of GBF1 lacking the Sec7 domain. Replication of BFA-resistant poliovirus in the presence of BFA is uncoupled from Arf activation but is dependent on GBF1. Thus the function(s) of this protein essential for viral replication can be separated from those required for cellular metabolism.","publish_time":"2010-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belov, George A.; Kovtunovych, Gennadiy; Jackson, Catherine L.; Ehrenfeld, Ellie","journal":"Cellular Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2311d3a5374d350eeebd3d38d2a5989eca12429c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b5d365c9fe9e05b03c5f1aabda184794f0ad9151.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2945620.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20497182/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2945620?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01482.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Replication of BFA","GBF1 function","poliovirus replication","contribution of GBF1","cellular protein GBF1","BFA block of polio replication","viral replication","catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1","presence of BFA","p115","N-terminal region of GBF1","inhibitor of Arf activation","resistant poliovirus","Poliovirus infection","Arf GTPases necessary","polio-infected cells","protein essential","uninfected cells","Rab1b knock","cellular metabolism","known activities","formation of COPI transport vesicles","factors","intracellular parasites","reproduction","expression","Viruses","host"],"language":"en"},

The cytopathic strains of this virus (cpBVDV) induce dramatic cytoplasmic vacuolization in cell cultures, while infection with the non-cytopathic (NCP-BVDV) strains produces no overt changes in the host cells. Our results show that extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization is the earliest morphological change in response to cpBVDV infection in MDBK cells. Cells with extensive vacuolization showed no co-existing chromatin condensation, caspase activation, or loss of membrane integrity. In addition, the caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk), although improving cell viability of infected cells from 6.7\u00B12.2% to 18.8\u00B12.2%, did not prevent vacuolization. On the ultrastructural level, the virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles are single membrane structures containing organelles and cellular debris, which appear capable of fusing with other vacuoles and engulfing surrounding cytoplasmic materials.

In addition, this lysosomal dye could be observed in the cytoplasm of vacuolized cells, suggesting a lysosomal abnormality. Our data demonstrate that cpBVDV induced a novel cell death pathway in MDBK cells that is primarily associated with lysosomal dysfunction and the formation of phagocytic cytoplasmic vacuoles, and this mode of cell death is different from apoptosis and necrosis.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Birk, Alexander V.; Dubovi, Edward J.; Cohen-Gould, Leona; Donis, Ruben; Szeto, Hazel.

In this paper, we address the dangers posed to societal sustainability. The concern being addressed is the very survival of societies where the rights of individuals, personal and collective freedoms, an independent judiciary and media, and democracy, despite its messiness, are highly valued. We argue that, as a result of various technological innovations, a range of dysfunctional impacts are threatening social and political stability. For instance, robotics and automation are replacing human labor and decision-making in a range of industries; search engines, monetized through advertising, have access to, and track, our interests and preferences; social media, in connecting us to one another often know more about us than we ourselves do, enabling them to profit in ways which may not coincide with our well-being; online retailers have not only acquired the ability to track and predict our buying choices, but also they can squeeze vendors based on their outsize bargaining power; and, in general, virtual technologies have changed both the way we think and our sense of self. With the rising deployment of the Internet of Things, and developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the threats to individual freedoms and rights, societal cohesion and harmony, employment and economic well-being, and trust in democracy are being ratcheted up. This paper lauds the benefits and addresses the harm wrought by the high tech giants in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The search for rapidly growing revenues (and shareholder returns and stock prices) drives firms to accelerate product innovation without fully investigating the entire gamut of their impacts. As greater wealth accrues to the leaders of tech firms, inequalities within firms and societies are widening, creating social tensions and political ferment. We explore the ethical nature of the challenge employing a simple utilitarian calculus, complemented by approaches rooted in rights, justice, and the common good. Various options to address the challenges posed by ICTs are considered and evaluated. We argue that regulation may do little more than slow down the damage to society, particularly since societal values and political preferences vary internationally. Firms need to establish ethical standards, imbuing the upholders of these standards with sufficient authority, while creating a culture of morality. User involvement and activism, and shareholders\u2019 concerns for the sustainability of societies on whose continued prosperity they depend, are imperative to humanity\u2019s ability to decide the future direction of technology.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arogyaswamy, Bernard","journal":"AI Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65900342de4cc7cb6fc36af9862b99e21a98c2fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095243.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-00956-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social media","societal sustainability","sustainability of societies","drives firms","social tensions","political preferences","leaders of tech firms","societal cohesion","rights of individuals","societal values","economic well-being","survival of societies","democracy","political ferment","political stability","ethical standards","ICTs","track","paper","range of dysfunctional impacts","individual freedoms","collective freedoms","range of industries","Communication Technologies","virtual technologies","humanity\u2019s ability","search engines","Various options","ethical nature","high tech giants","result of various technological innovations","artificial intelligence","shareholder returns","developments","stock prices","threats","Information","employment","harmony","machine learning","shareholders\u2019 concerns","independent judiciary","automation","Internet of Things","human labor","decision-making","approaches","product innovation","upholders","inequalities","growing revenues","simple utilitarian calculus","robotics","activism","sufficient authority","justice","society","trust","continued prosperity","interests","outsize bargaining power","User involvement","entire gamut","future direction of technology","vendors","rising deployment","advertising","damage","challenges","dangers","greater wealth","online retailers","culture of morality","instance","messiness","access","benefits","forces","sense of self","buying choices","regulation","ways"],"language":"en"},

To clarify the origin of these changes, we studied in vitro the effects of amiodarone on endosomal activities like transferrin recycling, Shiga toxin processing, ESCRT-dependent lentivirus budding, fluid phase endocytosis, proteolysis and exosome secretion. Furthermore, since the accumulation of LBPA might point to a broader disturbance in lipid homeostasis, we studied the effect of amiodarone on the distribution of LBPA, unesterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin and glycosphyngolipids. Amiodarone analogues were also studied, including the recently developed derivative dronedarone. We found that amiodarone does not affect early endosomal activities, like transferrin recycling, Shiga toxin processing and lentivirus budding. Amiodarone, instead, interferes with late compartments of the endocytic pathway, blocking the progression of fluid phase endocytosis and causing fusion of organelles, collapse of lumenal structures, accumulation of undegraded substrates and amassing of different types of lipids. Not all late endocytic compartments are affected, since exosome secretion is spared. These changes recall the Niemann-Pick type-C phenotype (NPC), but originate by a different mechanism, since, differently from NPC, they are not alleviated by cholesterol removal. Studies with analogues indicate that basic pKa and high water-solubility at acidic pH are crucial requirements for the interference with late endosomes/lysosomes and that, in this respect, dronedarone is at least as potent as amiodarone. These findings may have relevance in fields unrelated to rhythm control.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piccoli, Elena; Nadai, Matteo; Caretta, Carla Mucignat; Bergonzini, Valeria; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Ha, Huy Riem; Bigler, Laurent; Dal Zoppo, Daniele; Faggin, Elisabetta; Pettenazzo, Andrea; Orlando, Rocco; Salata, Cristiano; Calistri, Arianna; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio; Baritussio, Aldo","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be00868cd51f203546241a111dda2d5b75945e62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092840.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2011.07.090; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295211005661; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295211005661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878321/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LBPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Amiodarone analogues","effect of amiodarone","effects of amiodarone","late compartments","accumulation of LBPA","late endosomes","late endocytic compartments","transferrin recycling","Shiga toxin processing","distribution of LBPA","exosome secretion","different mechanism","changes","NPC","progression of fluid phase endocytosis","early endosomal activities","different tissues vacuoles","different types of lipids","ESCRT-dependent lentivirus budding","endocytic pathway","unesterified cholesterol","cholesterol removal","derivative dronedarone","accumulation of undegraded substrates","high water-solubility","acidic pH","crucial requirements","basic pKa","interference","proteolysis","lumenal structures","airway secretions","Niemann-Pick type-C phenotype","relevance","fields unrelated","inclusion bodies","fusion of organelles","lysobisphosphatidic acid","lipid homeostasis","rhythm control","monoacylglycero","phosphate","broader disturbance","sphingomyelin","lysosomes","Abstract Patients","findings","respect","glycosphyngolipids","Studies","origin"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the efficacy and safety of combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688. FINDINGS: Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 were assigned to the control group. The median number of days from symptom onset to start of study treatment was 5 days (IQR 3\u20137). The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5\u201311]) than the control group (12 days [8\u201315]; hazard ratio 4\u00B737 [95% CI 1\u00B786\u201310\u00B724], p=0\u00B70010). Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups. One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir\u2013ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir\u2013ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.

These soluble gp41 fusion proteins could be an important source of antigens for future vaccine development efforts.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Penn-Nicholson, Adam; Han, Dong P.; Kim, Soon J.; Park, Hanna; Ansari, Rais; Montefiori, David C.; Cho, Michael W.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fe1e352dd5cfbda41830bd67cbf6e8ba044bcdc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/60a3936ab4ac68d18c6ae1da313774b37d84e087.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2293309.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207007647; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2293309?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207007647","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soluble gp41 fusion proteins","individual patients","infected patients","different regions of gp41","transmembrane glycoprotein gp41","stronger antibody responses","immunogenic properties of gp41","HIV","amino acids of gp41 ectodomain","4E10","reactive neutralizing antibodies 2F5","soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins","future vaccine development efforts","potent neutralizing activity","membrane-proximal external region","important source of antigens","group consensus envelope sequence","C-terminal","Human immunodeficiency virus type","attractive target","epitopes","peptides"],"language":"en"},

We reanalysed a previously published dataset, examining the relative effects of species\u0027 traits on patterns of viral diversity in bats and rodents. We expanded on prior work by using more highly resolved phylogenies for bats and rodents and incorporating a phylogenetically controlled principal components analysis. For rodents, sympatry and torpor use were important predictors of viral richness and, as previously reported, phylogeny had minimal impact in models. For bats, in contrast to prior work, we find that phylogeny does have an effect in models. Patterns of viral diversity in bats were related to geographical distribution (i.e. latitude and range size) and life history (i.e. lifespan, body size and birthing frequency). However, the effects of these predictors were marginal relative to citation count, emphasizing that the ability to accurately assess reservoir status largely depends on sampling effort and highlighting the need for additional data in future comparative studies.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guy, Cylita; Thiagavel, Jeneni; Mideo, Nicole; Ratcliffe, John M.","journal":"R Soc Open Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/264b30686ef5ca001923b9820e7d96fdb74e268e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bd246a6d199cb961f7c4c3421d22324aface4ff4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6408376.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.181182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bats","pathogen diversity","patterns of viral diversity","rodents","reservoir species","reservoir status","phylogeny","prior work","models","understanding","important predictors of viral richness","body size","range size","relative effects of species\u0027 traits","Comparative methods","future comparative studies","major human outbreaks","torpor use","need","lifespan","life history","correcting","additional data","powerful tools","latitude","citation count","sympatry","variation","geographical distribution","factors","sampling effort","phylogenetic relatedness","resolved phylogenies","birthing frequency","ability","controlled principal components analysis","minimal impact","published dataset","contrast","key sources","wildlife","Diseases"],"language":"en"},

Amidst increasing interest in international partnerships to address such issues, how best to develop such collaborations is being actively debated. In 2006, a partnership developed between occupational health and infection control experts in Canada and institutions in South Africa (including an institute with a national mandate to conduct research and provide guidance to protect health workers from infectious diseases and promote improved working conditions). This article describes the collaboration, analyzes the determinants of success and shares lessons learned. METHODS: Synthesizing participant-observer experience from over 9 years of collaboration and 10 studies already published from this work, we applied a realist review analysis to describe the various achievements at global, national, provincial and hospital levels. Expectations of the various parties on developing new insights, providing training, and addressing service needs were examined through a micro-meso-macro lens, focusing on how each main partner organization contributed to and benefitted from working together. RESULTS: A state-of-the-art occupational health and safety surveillance program was established in South Africa following successful technology transfer from a similar undertaking in Canada and training was conducted that synergistically benefitted Northern as well as Southern trainees. Integrated policies combining infection control and occupational health to prevent and control infectious disease transmission among health workers were also launched. Having a national (South-South) network reinforced by the international (North\u2013south) partnership was pivotal in mitigating the challenges that emerged. CONCLUSIONS: High-income country partnerships with experience in health system strengthening \u2013 particularly in much needed areas such as occupational health and infection control \u2013 can effectively work through strong collaborators in the Global South to build capacity. Partnerships are particularly well positioned to sustainably reinforce efforts at national and sub-national LMIC levels when they adopt a \u201Ccommunities of practice\u201D model, characterized by multi-directional learning. The principles of effective collaboration learned in this \u201Cpartnership of partnerships\u201D to improve working conditions for health workers can be applied to other areas where health system strengthening is needed.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yassi, Annalee; Zungu, Muzimkhulu; Spiegel, Jerry M.; Kistnasamy, Barry; Lockhart, Karen; Jones, David; O\u2019Hara, Lyndsay M.; Nophale, Letshego; Bryce, Elizabeth A.; Darwin, Lincoln","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95af044a0d57fffb101b547ff1f58122d05771bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4818531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036516/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-016-0145-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa","Canada"],"keyphrases":["Health workers","state-of-the-art occupational health","South-South","health system strengthening","limited implementation of occupational health","South Africa","Global South","partnership of partnerships","infection control experts","infection control measures","critical health human resource deficiencies","national mandate","international partnerships","infectious diseases","control infectious disease transmission","sub-national LMIC levels","Canada","training","High-income country partnerships","improved working conditions","years of collaboration","needed areas","principles of effective collaboration","various achievements","various parties","hospital levels","Synthesizing participant-observer experience","safety surveillance program","successful technology transfer","similar undertaking","high risk","institutions","model","middle-income countries","guidance","network","realist review analysis","Integrated policies","micro-meso-macro lens","METHODS","determinants of success","new insights","North","CONCLUSIONS","research","efforts","institute","service needs","multi-directional learning","strong collaborators","shares lessons","communities of practice","studies","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","main partner organization","Southern trainees","Expectations","challenges","issues","capacity","article","collaborations"],"language":"en"},

The H5N1 avian influenza does not presently meet the criteria of an antigenically shifted strain. It is presently an avian strain that has not undergone reassortment with a human strain and is not well adapted to humans. H5N1 isolates are resistant to the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine; these antivirals do not have a role for the treatment or prophylaxis against the strain. The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, have in vitro activities against the human H5N1 isolates; however, recent data suggest that higher doses for longer periods may be required to be effective. Oseltamivir is an oral agent approved for prophylaxis and the treatment of influenza infections. Zanamivir is delivered topically to the respiratory tract with similar indications. The drugs discussed in the chapter for MDR-TB fall into three categories\u2014quinolones, nitroimidazoles, and pyrroles. Drugs such as moxifloxacin are methoxyfluoroquinolones, which are already available and approved for the treatment of acute respiratory infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, acute sinusitis, and skin infections.

A regulatory agency-approved vaccine is not available, and existing prophylaxis and therapies are limited to use in high-risk pediatric patients; thus additional therapies are sorely needed. Here, we identify a series of benzimidazole analogs that inhibit hRSV infection in vitro with high potency, using a previously-reported high-throughput screening assay. The lead compound, SRI 29365 (1-[6-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-3-yl]methyl-1H-benzimidazole), has an EC(50) of 66 \u03BCM and a selectivity \u003E50. We identified additional compounds with varying potencies by testing commercially-available chemical analogs. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that SRI 29365 effectively inhibits viral replication only if present during the early stages of viral infection. We isolated a virus with resistance to SRI 29365 and identified mutations in the transmembrane domain of the viral G protein genomic sequence that suggested that the compound inhibits G-protein mediated attachment of hRSV to cells. Additional experiments with multiple cell types indicated that SRI 29365 antiviral activity correlates with the binding of cell surface heparin by full-length G protein. Lastly, SRI 29365 did not reduce hRSV titers or morbidity/mortality in efficacy studies using a cotton rat model. Although SRI 29365 and analogs inhibit hRSV replication in vitro, this work suggests that the G-protein may not be a valid drug target in vivo.","publish_time":"2015-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evans, Carrie W.; Atkins, Colm; Pathak, Ashish; Gilbert, Brian E.; Noah, James W.","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1a4bd4968756e4b3b1a8083f093029037086cf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185459.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.06.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354215001473; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354215001473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SRI","EC"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["SRI","hRSV infection","hRSV replication","hRSV titers","G-protein mediated attachment of hRSV","full-length G protein","viral G protein genomic sequence","viral replication","additional therapies","Additional experiments","children","available chemical analogs","additional compounds","early stages of viral infection","series of benzimidazole analogs","significant mortality","year of age","high-risk groups","addition experiments","lead compound","high potency","multiple cell types","high-risk pediatric patients","binding of cell surface heparin","Human respiratory syncytial virus","high-throughput screening assay","efficacy studies","antiviral activity correlates","transmembrane domain","pneumonia","infants","morbidity","present","common cause of bronchiolitis","varying potencies","cotton rat model","regulatory agency-approved vaccine","mutations","cells","work","existing prophylaxis","contagious Paramyxovirus","thiadiazol","meth","resistance","valid drug target","triazolo","\u03BCM","Time","furyl","selectivity","hospitalizations"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about IL-32 production by exogenous pathogens infection in human individuals. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we found that IL-32 level was increased by 58.2% in the serum samples from a cohort of 108 patients infected by influenza A virus comparing to that of 115 healthy individuals. Another pro-inflammatory factor cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-associated prostaglandin E2 was also upregulated by 2.7-fold. Expression of IL-32 in influenza A virus infected A549 human lung epithelial cells was blocked by either selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 or Aspirin, a known anti-inflammatory drug, indicating IL-32 was induced through COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade. Interestingly, we found that COX-2-associate PGE(2) production activated by influenza virus infection was significantly suppressed by over-expression of IL-32 but increased by IL-32-specific siRNA, suggesting there was a feedback mechanism between IL-32 and COX-2. CONCLUSIONS: IL-32 is induced by influenza A virus infection via COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade.

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases were searched combining the words infection with the following keywords: rafting, whitewater, surfing, (surfer* or windsurf*), (caves or caving or spelunking), (triathlon or trekking) or (hiking or adventure race), bicycling, backpacking, (mountain climb* or bouldering), horseback riding, orienteering, trekking, and skiing. RESULTS: Adventure travel is becoming much more common among travelers and it is associated with a subset of infectious diseases including: leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, rickettsial diseases and endemic mycosis. Caving and whitewater rafting places individuals at particular risk of leptospirosis, schistosomiasis and endemic mycosis, while adventure races also place individuals at high risk of a variety of infections including campylobacter, norovirus and leptospirosis. CONCLUSION: Travel practitioners need to be aware of the risks associated with adventure travel and should educate individuals about the risks associated with various activities. Doxycycline prophylaxis should be considered for travelers who are susceptible to leptospirosis due to participation in high-risk sports such as whitewater rafting, caving or adventure races.","publish_time":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gundacker, Nathan D.; Rolfe, Robert J.; Rodriguez, J.

This perspective, however, is changing due to increasing discoveries of functional viral RNA elements that are formed by long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions, often spanning thousands of nucleotides. The plus-strand RNA genomes of tombusviruses exemplify this concept by possessing different long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions that regulate both viral translation and transcription. Here we report that a third fundamental tombusvirus process, viral genome replication, requires a long-range RNA\u2013based interaction spanning \u223C3000 nts. In vivo and in vitro analyses suggest that the discontinuous RNA platform formed by the interaction facilitates efficient assembly of the viral RNA replicase.

In this study, we screened quinoline derivatives, which are known antimalarial drugs for inhibition of DENV2 and West Nile virus (WNV) replication using the corresponding replicon expressing cell-based assays. Amodiaquine (AQ), one of the 4-aminoquinoline drugs, inhibited DENV2 infectivity measured by plaque assays, with EC(50) and EC(90) values of 1.08 \u00B1 0.09 \u00B5M and 2.69 \u00B1 0.47 \u00B5M, respectively, and DENV2 RNA replication measured by Renilla luciferase reporter assay, with EC(50) value of 7.41 \u00B1 1.09 \u00B5M in the replicon expressing cells. Cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) in BHK-21 cells was 52.09 \u00B1 4.25 \u00B5M. The replication inhibition was confirmed by plaque assay of the extracellular virions as well as by qRT-PCR of the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels.

DENV protease, 5\u2019-methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase do not seem to be targets of AQ.

Development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tools is urgently needed. We developed an immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV. Eighty-six serum samples collected from patients who were hospitalized for other causes were examined to determine the cut-off O.D. value. The cut-off O.D. value was defined as 0.175 by calculating the mean O.D. value of the 86 sera plus 3 standard deviations. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA, 56 positive sera and 204 negative sera were tested. The sensitivity was 96.4% and the specificity was 100%.

Cleavage of signal peptide at the C-terminus of HCV core protein by SPP was characterized in this study. The spko mutant (mutate a.a. 189\u2013193 from ASAYQ to PPFPF) is more efficient than the A/F mutant (mutate a.a 189 and 191 from A to F) in blocking the cleavage of signal peptide by signal peptidase. The cleavage efficiency of SPP is inversely proportional to the length of C-terminal extension of the signal peptide: the longer the extension, the less efficiency the cleavage is. Thus, reducing the length of C-terminal extension of signal peptide by signal peptidase cleavage could facilitate further cleavage by SPP. The recombinant core protein fused with signal peptide from the C-terminus of p7 protein, but not those from the C-termini of E1 and E2, could be cleaved by SPP. Therefore, the sequence of the signal peptide is important but not the sole determinant for its cleavage by SPP. Replacement of the HCV core protein E.R.-associated domain (a.a. 120\u2013150) with the E.R.-associated domain (a.a.1\u201350) of SARS-CoV membrane protein results in the failure of cleavage of this recombinant protein by SPP, though this protein still is E.R.-associated. This result suggests that not only E.R.-association but also specific protein sequence is important for the HCV core protein signal peptide cleavage by SPP. Thus, our results suggest that both sequences of the signal peptide and the E.R.-associated domain are important for the signal peptide cleavage of HCV core protein by SPP.

Among these, coronavirus infection may cause life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this review, we present animal models and techniques for the study of ARDS, and discuss the roles and possible mechanisms of various chemical factors, including nitric oxide (NO). Our early work revealed that cerebral compression elicits severe hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (PE), leading to central sympathetic activation that results in systemic vasoconstriction. The consequence of systemic vasoconstriction is volume and pressure loading in the pulmonary circulation. Vasodilators, but not oxidant radical scavengers, are effective in the prevention of centrogenic PE. In isolated perfused lung, exogenous and endogenous NO enhances lung injury following air embolism and ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast, NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors reverse such lung injury. Although NO is important in maintaining vasodilator tone, hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is accompanied by an increase instead of a decrease in NO release. In animal and isolated lung studies, endotoxin produces acute lung injury that is associated with increases in cytokines and inducible NOS mRNA expression, suggesting that NO is toxic to the lung in endotoxin shock. Recently, we reported several rare cases that indicate that ARDS in patients with Japanese B encephalitis, lymphangitis with breast cancer and fat embolism is caused by different mechanisms. Our early and recent studies on ARDS and PE may provide information for clinical practice and the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.","publish_time":"2003-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Hsing I.; Kao, Shang Jyh; Wang, David; Lee, Ru Ping; Su, Chain Fa","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute lung injury","isolated lung studies","isolated perfused lung","pulmonary vasoconstriction","study of ARDS","life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","pulmonary circulation","consequence of systemic vasoconstriction","severe hemorrhagic pulmonary edema","prevention of centrogenic PE","fat embolism","air embolism","recent studies","endotoxin shock","different mechanisms","various disorders","early work","pathogenesis of SARS","possible mechanisms of various chemical factors","present animal models","inducible NOS mRNA expression","lymphangitis","cerebral compression","Japanese B encephalitis","breast cancer","patients","increases","understanding","cytokines","techniques","hypoxia","information","roles","pressure","volume","ischemia","clinical practice","vasodilator tone","coronavirus infection","oxidant radical scavengers","central sympathetic activation","nitric oxide","inhibitors","Vasodilators","synthase","review","reperfusion","rare cases","decrease","contrast","release"],"language":"en"},

Correspondence analysis, a commonly used multivariate statistical approach, was carried out to analyze synonymous codon usage bias. The analysis showed that the overall extent of codon usage bias in FMDV is low. Furthermore, the good correlation between the frequency of G \u002B C at the synonymous third position of sense codons (GC(3S)) content at silent sites of each sequence and codon usage bias suggested that mutation pressure rather than natural (translational) selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias observed. In addition, other factors, such as the lengths of open reading frame (ORF) and the hydrophobicity of genes also influence the codon usage variation among the genomes of FMDV in a minor way. The result of phylogenetic analyses based on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values indicated a few obvious phylogenetic incongruities, which suggest that more FMDV genome diversity may exist in nature than is currently indicated. Our work might give some clues to the features of FMDV genome and some evolutionary information of this virus.","publish_time":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Jincheng; Li, Yanmin; Zhao, Sheng; Liu, Shenggang; Zhang, Zhidong","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b52f3b7a525263af4c27e61d2cf4e2d4d8e5ba6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089325.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV","G   C"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["codon bias","synonymous codon usage bias","codon usage variation","relative synonymous codon usage","overall extent of codon usage bias","survey of codon usage bias of FMD virus","genomes of FMDV","features of FMDV genome","FMDV genome diversity","important determinant","mouth disease","Correspondence analysis","important viral-induced livestock disease","obvious phylogenetic incongruities","result of phylogenetic analyses","values","RSCU","ORF","mutation pressure","sequence","silent sites","GC","content","position of sense codons","lengths of open reading frame","frequency of G","hydrophobicity of genes","evolutionary information","selection","clues","results","good correlation","multivariate statistical approach","minor way","serotypes","nature","factors","Asia","Foot","addition","work","study"],"language":"en"},

The infectivity of symptomatic SARS cases in hospital and in the community was estimated. Community SARS cases caused transmission to others at an estimated rate of 0.4 per infective per day during the early part of the epidemic, reducing to 0.2 in the later part of the epidemic. For hospitalised patients, the daily infectivity was approximately 0.15 early in the epidemic, but fell to 0.0006 in the later part of the epidemic. Despite the lower daily infectivity level for hospitalised patients, the long duration of the hospitalisation led to a greater number of transmissions within hospitals compared with the community in the early part of the epidemic, as estimated by this study.

However, how CPV-2 participates in cell regulation and immune response remains unknown. In this study, persistently infected MDCK cells were generated through culture passage of the CPV-2a-infected cells for ten generations. Our study showed that CPV-2a induces cell proliferation arrest and cell morphology alternation before the fourth generation, whereas, the cell morphology returns to normal after five times of passages. PCR detection of viral VP2 gene demonstrated that CPV-2a proliferate with cell passage. An immunofluorescence assay revealed that CPV-2a particles were mainly located in the cell nuclei of MDCK cell. Then transcriptome microarray revealed that gene expression pattern of MDCK with CPV-2a persistent infection is distinct compared with normal cells. Gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis demonstrated that CPV-2a infection induces a series of membrane-associated genes expression, including many MHC protein or MHC-related complexes. These genes are closely related to signaling pathways of virus\u2013host interaction, including antigen processing and presentation pathway, intestinal immune network, graft-versus-host disease, and RIG-I-like helicases signaling pathway. In contrast, the suppressed genes mediated by CPV-2a showed low enrichment in any category, and were only involved in pathways linking to synthesis and metabolism of amino acids, which was confirmed by qPCR analysis. Our studies indicated that CPV-2a is a natural immune activator and has the capacity to activate host immune responses, which could be used for the development of antiviral strategy and biomaterial for medicine.","publish_time":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Xu-Xu; Gao, Yuan; Shu, Long; Wei, Yan-Quan; Yao, Xue-Ping; Cao, Sui-Zhong; Peng, Guang-Neng; Liu, Xiang-Tao; Sun, Shi-Qi","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/242d304a3994911166bc2f4db6ad6867c60db241.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089364.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["variant of CPV","cell nuclei of MDCK cell","cell passage","cell regulation","cell morphology alternation","cell proliferation arrest","host immune responses","infected MDCK cells","suppressed genes","normal cells","infected cells","associated genes expression","gene expression pattern of MDCK","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","presentation pathway","intestinal immune network","host interaction","Genome pathway analysis","natural immune activator","host disease","study","Gene ontology annotation","MHC-related complexes","MHC protein","persistent infection","pathways of virus","culture passage","qPCR analysis","PCR detection of viral VP2 gene","showed low enrichment","antigen processing","severe gastroenteritis","death","graft","capacity","series of membrane","biomaterial","contagious pathogen","young dogs","synthesis","transcriptome microarray","development of antiviral strategy","metabolism of amino acids","medicine","category","RIG","Canine parvovirus type","times of passages","helicases","contrast","generations","immunofluorescence assay","particles","studies"],"language":"en"},

Since its New World introduction, WNV has caused disease in human, avian, and mammalian communities across the continent. American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) are a highly susceptible WNV host and when modeled appropriately, changes in crow abundances can serve as a proxy for the spatio-temporal presence of WNV. We use the dramatic declines in abundance of this avian host to examine spatio-temporal heterogeneity in WNV intensity across the northeastern US, where WNV was first detected. Using data from the Breeding Bird Survey, we identify significant declines in crow abundance after WNV emergence that are associated with lower forest cover, more urban land use, and warmer winter temperatures. Importantly, we document continued declines as WNV was present in an area over consecutive years. Our findings support the urban-pathogen link that human WNV incidence studies have shown. For each 1% increase in urban land cover we expect an additional 5% decline in the log crow abundance beyond the decline attributed to WNV in undeveloped areas. We also demonstrate a significant relationship between above-average winter temperatures and WNV-related declines in crow abundance. The mechanisms behind these patterns remain uncertain and hypotheses requiring further research are suggested. In particular, a strong positive relationship between urban land cover and winter temperatures may confound mechanistic understanding, especially when a temperature-sensitive vector is involved.","publish_time":"2010-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"LaDeau, Shannon L.; Calder, Catherine A.; Doran, Patrick J.; Marra, Peter P.","journal":"Ecol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d86b3efc925af48c846918122fd01a753d85b54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089484.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzIwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WNV intensity","WNV emergence","WNV-related declines","susceptible WNV host","spatio-temporal presence of WNV","human WNV incidence studies","urban land cover","urban land use","significant declines","log crow abundance","continued declines","dramatic declines","crow abundances","average winter temperatures","warmer winter temperatures","urban-pathogen link","significant relationship","avian host","lower forest cover","spatio-temporal heterogeneity","northeastern US","strong positive relationship","potential severity of vector","temperature-sensitive vector","reawakening US public awareness","summer","proxy","disease","Breeding Bird Survey","Corvus brachyrhynchos","mechanistic understanding","mammalian communities","New World introduction","patterns","hypotheses","American crows","consecutive years","data","pathogens","findings","West Nile virus","changes","undeveloped areas","increase","mechanisms","research","western hemisphere","continent"],"language":"en"},

PURPOSE: To investigate the level of knowledge and attitudes towards the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak across various ethnic groups and socio-demographic backgrounds in Malaysia. METHOD: A cross-sectional, population-based, computer-assisted telephone interview exploring knowledge and attitudes regarding influenza A(H1N1) was conducted in Malaysia. Between July 11 and September 12, 2009, a total of 1,050 respondents were interviewed (response rate 69.3%). RESULTS: The mean total knowledge score for the overall sample was 7.30 (SD \u00B1 1.961) out of a possible score of 13 (Chinese had the highest scores, followed by Indians, then Malays). Some erroneous beliefs about the modes of transmission were identified. The majority of the participants (73.8%) perceived the A(H1N1) infection as often deadly. Despite the overestimation of the severity of A(H1N1) infection, high confidence in preventing infection and low perceived susceptibility of infection were reported. Influenza A(H1N1)-related stigma was prevalent and exhibited differences across ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that provision of education and clear information are essential to correct the misconceptions, and increase perceived susceptibility to infection so that the general public will take precautions against A(H1N1) infection.","publish_time":"2010-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Li Ping; Sam, I-Ching","journal":"Int J Behav Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c18750a96e16f1d11a62518525c8738ac95e575.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090469.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzIxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["H1N1","attitudes","low perceived susceptibility of infection","influenza","level of knowledge","mean total knowledge score","Assessment of general public\u2019s knowledge","Malaysia","various ethnic groups","possible score","development","exhibited differences","socio-demographic backgrounds","prevention of new disease outbreaks","related stigma","overall sample","high confidence","provision of education","computer","profound effects","clear information","telephone interview","Chinese","misconceptions","RESULTS","precautions","health behaviors","Indians","erroneous beliefs","modes of transmission","highest scores","population","Findings","respondents","severity","control","response rate","METHOD","CONCLUSIONS","SD","majority","participants","epidemic","PURPOSE","overestimation"],"language":"en"},

In this research study, long-range all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were engaged for the bound and the unbound proteins to enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the Hsp90 dimerization and inhibition. Results evidently showed that coumermycin A1 (C\u2013A1), a recently discovered Hsp90 inhibitor, binds at the dimer\u2019s active site of the Hsp90 protein and leads to a substantial parting between dimeric opposed residues, which include Arg591.B, Lys594.A, Ser663.A, Thr653.B, Ala665.A, Thr649.B, Leu646.B and Asn669.A. Significant differences in magnitudes were observed in radius of gyration, root-mean-square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation, which confirms a reasonably more flexible state in the apo conformation associated with it dimerization. In contrast, the bound conformer of Hsp90 showed less flexibility. This visibly highpoints the inhibition process resulting from the binding of the ligand. These findings were further validated by principal component analysis. We believe that the detailed dynamic analyses of Hsp90 presented in this study, would give an imperative insight and better understanding to the function and mechanisms of inhibition. Furthermore, information obtained from the binding mode of the inhibitor would be of great assistance in the design of more potent inhibitors against the HIV target Hsp90.

Polymicrobial synergy can occur during infection, in which the combined effect of two or more microbes on disease is worse than seen with any of the individuals alone. Powerful genomic methods are increasingly used to study microbial communities, including metagenomics to reveal the members and genetic content of a community and metatranscriptomics to describe the activities of community members. Recent efforts focused toward a mechanistic understanding of these interactions have led to a better appreciation of the precise bases of polymicrobial synergy in communities containing bacteria, eukaryotic microbes, and/or viruses. These studies have benefited from advances in the development of in vivo models of polymicrobial infection and modern techniques to profile the spatial and chemical bases of intermicrobial communication.

To characterize the specific role of swine influenza virus in PRDC presentation in Colombia, 11 farms from three major production regions in Colombia were examined in this study. Nasal swabs, bronchial lavage and lung tissue samples were obtained from animals displaying symptoms compatible with SIV. Isolation of SIV was performed in 9-day embryonated chicken eggs or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Positive isolates, identified via the hemagglutination inhibition test, were further analyzed using PCR. Overall, 7 of the 11 farms were positive for SIV. Notably, sequencing of the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein led to grouping of strains into circulating viruses identified during the human outbreak of 2009, classified as pandemic H1N1-2009. Serum samples from 198 gilts and multiparous sows between 2008 and 2009 were obtained to determine antibody presence of APP, Myh, PCV2 and PRRSV in both SIV-H1N1p-negative and -positive farms, but higher levels were recorded for SIV-H1N1p-positive farms. Odds ratio (OR) and P values revealed statistically significant differences (p\u003C0.05) in PRDC presentation in gilts and multiparous sows of farms positive for SIV-H1N1p.

The model is suitable for populations where two frequent modes of transmission of hepatitis C virus, namely unsafe blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, are dominant. The susceptible population is divided into two distinct compartments, the intravenous drug users and individuals undergoing unsafe blood transfusions. Individuals belonging to each compartment may develop acute and then possibly chronic infections. Chronically infected individuals may be quarantined. The analysis indicates that the eradication and persistence of the disease is completely determined by the magnitude of basic reproduction number R (c). It is shown that for the basic reproduction number R (c) \u003C 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. For R (c) \u003E 1, an endemic equilibrium exists and the disease is uniformly persistent. In addition, we present the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of different important model parameters on the disease prevalence. When the infected population persists, we have designed a time-dependent optimal quarantine strategy to minimize it. The Pontryagin\u2019s Maximum Principle is used to characterize the optimal control in terms of an optimality system which is solved numerically. Numerical results for the optimal control are compared against the constant controls and their efficiency is discussed.","publish_time":"2013-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imran, Mudassar; Rafique, Hassan; Khan, Adnan; Malik, Tufail","journal":"Theory Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf53aed78f8724163ee5178c5ba1fb9ad17e27be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal control","infected individuals","hepatitis C virus","unsafe blood transfusions","deterministic model","magnitude of basic reproduction number R","disease prevalence","infected population","intravenous drug users","transmission dynamics of hepatitis","endemic equilibrium","susceptible population","disease-free equilibrium","influence of different important model parameters","time-dependent optimal quarantine strategy","frequent modes of transmission","rigorous mathematical analysis","distinct compartments","populations","terms","sensitivity analyses","constant controls","optimality system","uncertainty","eradication","persistence","Numerical results","Pontryagin\u2019s Maximum Principle","chronic infections","efficiency","paper","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A series of CpG ODN with different primary structures were synthesized. Their capabilities to stimulate mouse spleen cell proliferation were determined by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03B1) secretion spectra induced by CpG ODN were assessed by ELISA. The ability of CpG ODN to activate natural killer cells was evaluated by standard 4 h (51)Cr-release assay. Flow cytometry was utilized to examine the expressions of various lymphocyte surface molecules on diverse immunocytes. An effective CpG ODN for murine, ODN1826, was set as the template of modification and the positive control. RESULTS: The immunostimulatory activities of CpG ODN with different sequences and compositions varied markedly, both in character and in extent. It was useless for improving the immunostimulatory activity of ODN1826 by simply increasing the functional hexameric CpG motif number, modifying the site of CpG motifs, or changing the distance between multi-CpG motifs. However, an addition of a self-complementary palindrome structure at the 3\u2032-end, but not the 5\u2032-end of CpG ODN, aroused marked improvement in its activity. Several designed ODN had superior comprehensive immunostimulatory properties compared to ODN1826. CONCLUSION: The immunostimulatory activity of a CpG ODN was relevant to its primary structure. It was useless for promoting immunostimulatory activity to simply change CpG motif number, space, or distance. The 3\u2032-end palindrome structure of CpG ODN is associated with enhanced immunostimulatory activity.","publish_time":"2007-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Hai-yan; Xia, Shao-you; Song, Hai-feng; Li, Na; Shang, Ming-mei; Zou, Jia; Wang, Qing-qing; Ou, Lun; Sun, Xiao; Ji, Ai-guo; Tang, Zhong-ming","journal":"Acta Pharmacol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50f39ca6a188a1df262079682ec228ddd45307df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG ODN","ELISA","CpG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["end of CpG ODN","series of CpG ODN","effective CpG ODN","immunostimulatory activities of CpG ODN","ability of CpG ODN","end palindrome structure of CpG ODN","site of CpG motifs","multi-CpG motifs","designed ODN","immunostimulatory activity of ODN1826","enhanced immunostimulatory activity","functional hexameric CpG motif number","superior comprehensive immunostimulatory properties","different primary structures","mouse spleen cells","primary structures of oligodeoxynucleo","dinucleotide motifs","distance","self-complementary palindrome structure","different sequences","mouse spleen cell proliferation","natural killer cells","Cr-release assay","thymidine incorporation assay","expressions of various lymphocyte surface molecules","tides","unmethylated deoxycytidyl-deoxyguanosine","diverse immunocytes","secretion spectra","compositions","marked improvement","IFN-\u03B1","capabilities","relationship","addition","space","template of modification","positive control","METHODS","RESULTS","character","Cytokine","interleukin","CONCLUSION","ELISA","Flow cytometry","extent","AIM"],"language":"en"},

The spectrum of NAFLD includes conditions that range from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. NAFLD is correlated with liver-related death and is predicted to be the most frequent indication for liver transplantation by 2030. Insulin resistance is directly correlated to the central mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients, which is strongly correlated to the imbalance of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, that is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Among the emerging treatment approaches for NAFLD is the anti-hypertensive agent telmisartan, which has positive effects on liver, lipid, and glucose metabolism, especially through its action on the renin\u2013angiotensin system, by blocking the ACE/AngII/AT1 axis and increasing ACE2/Ang(1\u20137)/Mas axis activation. However, treatment with this drug is only recommended for patients with an established indication for anti-hypertensive therapy. Thus, there is an increased need for large randomized controlled trials with the aim of elucidating the effects of telmisartan on liver disease, especially NAFLD. From this perspective, the present review aims to provide a brief examination of the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH and the role of telmisartan on preventing liver disorders and thus to improve the discussion on potential therapies.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bor\u00E9m, Luciana M.

IC(50) values of these inhibitors were determined by PPIase inhibition activity assays. RESULTS: All the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) of the seven compounds binding to CypD were below 10 \u03BCmol/L. The IC(50) values were all consistent with the SPR and FT results.

Compound GW5 had binding selectivity for CypD over CypA. CONCLUSION: The agreement between the measured IC(50) values and the results of SPR and FT suggests that these methods are appropriate and powerful methods for identifying CypD inhibitors.

Although the risk of EBV-LPD after autologous transplantation is low, case reports of this complication in the autologous setting exist. We report a higher incidence than previously described of EBV-LPD in children undergoing sequential high-dose chemotherapy supported with CD34 selected peripheral blood stem cells (CD34\u002B PBSC). The median time to LPD after tandem transplant was 3 months (range 1\u20135 months). Five patients out of 156 (3.5%) developed EBV-LPD while enrolled on two trials of tandem autologous SCT in high-risk pediatric malignancies. Both studies employed five cycles of induction therapy, followed by tandem autologous PBSC transplants. In all, 108 out of 156 patients received CD34\u002B PBSC; 48 received unselected PBSC. All patients contracting LPD were from the CD34 selected group. Treatment of EBV-LPD included rituximab in four out of five patients, IVIg in two out of five patients, and gancyclovir in two out of five patients. EBV-LPD resolved in four out of five patients. We conclude that the combination of tandem SCT and CD34 selection may have increased immunosuppression in these patients to a point where there is an elevated risk of EBV-LPD.","publish_time":"2004-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Powell, J L; Bunin, N J; Callahan, C; Aplenc, R; Griffin, G; Grupp, S A","journal":"Bone Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/044451640d900feb98a60182525365e7c540fa1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091929.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091929/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Allogeneic BMT","LPD","PBSC","SCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBV-LPD","patients","Treatment of EBV","elevated risk of EBV","tandem autologous PBSC transplants","CD34 selection","trials of tandem autologous SCT","CD34 selected group","tandem transplant","autologous transplantation","autologous setting","risk of Epstein","risk factor","unselected PBSC","combination of tandem SCT","months","T-cell","depleted stem cell products","peripheral blood stem cells","Barr virus lymphoproliferative disease","sequential high-dose chemotherapy","children","case reports","high-risk pediatric malignancies","complication","increased immunosuppression","cycles of induction therapy","range","point","median time","rituximab","studies","use","immunosuppressive therapies","Allogeneic BMT","higher incidence","IVIg","gancyclovir"],"language":"en"},

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. DEVELOPMENT: Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. CONCLUSION: Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mat\u00EDas-Guiu, J.; Gomez-Pinedo, U.; Montero-Escribano, P.; Gomez-Iglesias, P.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Matias-Guiu, J.A.","journal":"Neurologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7136883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299636/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","CoV-OC43","cases of neurological symptoms","MERS-CoV epidemics","presence of neurological lesions","onset neurological symptoms","neurological diseases","coronavirus infection","presence of coronavirus","greater CNS involvement","coronavirus epidemics","high number of patients","high number of cases","specific characteristics of SARS","Follow-up of patients","isolated cases","E infection","demyelinating lesions","mouse hepatitis virus model","central nervous system","access","mechanisms","careful assessment","multiple sclerosis","likelihood of early","question","evidence","literature","coronaviruses","CONCLUSION","DEVELOPMENT","immune response","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. Objectives The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. Study design Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children\u2019s hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. Results Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. Conclusions Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morikawa, Saeko; Kohdera, Urara; Hosaka, Taisuke; Ishii, Kousuke; Akagawa, Shohei; Hiroi, Satoshi; Kase, Tetsuo","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5aa91cda68ad7d920c0b7fa9dea0bed7d891c5cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106374.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.10.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215006848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26521224/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215006848","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detected viruses","uncultivable viruses","respiratory viral infections","seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses","single viral infections","dual infections","multiple infections","clinical outcomes of single infections","multiple viral infections","clinical symptoms","clinical importance","infection of rhinoviruses","lower respiratory tract","disease severity","Seasonal variations","specimens","Conclusions Seasonal distribution","Study design Nasal aspirate samples","real-time PCR","prolonged hospitalization of patients","polymerase chain reaction","method","outpatients","Abstract Background","oxygenation","need","inpatients","children\u2019s hospital","findings","relation","underlying conditions","common occurrence","coinfection rates","Objectives","significant differences","factors","epidemic peaks","Results"],"language":"en"},

It arrived in several Chinese cities from imported cases and then spread as people travelled domestically by all means of transportation, among which road traffic was the most commonly used for daily commuting. Spatial variation in socioeconomic status not only accelerates migration across regions but also partly induces the differences in epidemic processes and in responses to epidemics across regions. However, the roles of both road travel and socioeconomic factors have not received the attention they deserve. Here, we constructed a national highway network for and between 333 cities in mainland China and extracted epidemiological variables and socioeconomic factors for each city. We calculated classic centrality measures for each city in the network and proposed two new measures (SumRatio and Multicenter Distance). We evaluated the correlation between the centrality measures and epidemiological features and conducted a spatial autoregression to quantify the impacts of road network and socioeconomic factors during the outbreak. The results showed that epidemics had more significant relationships with both our new measures than the classic ones. Higher population density, higher per person income, larger SumRatio and Multicenter Distance, more hospitals and college students, and lower per person GDP were associated with higher cumulative incidence. Higher population density and number of slaughtered pigs were found to advance epidemic arrival time. Higher population density, more colleges and slaughtered pigs, and lower Multicenter Distance were associated with longer epidemic duration. In conclusion, road transport and socioeconomic status had significant impacts and should be considered for the prevention and control of future pandemics.","publish_time":"2019-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Bo; Tian, Huaiyu; Sabel, Clive Eric; Xu, Bing","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bb8f28608aad3bde8b470c81025ce3c9e3a5fc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6480969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959783/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16071223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["socioeconomic factors","Higher population density","socioeconomic status","new measures","impacts of road network","lower Multicenter Distance","classic centrality measures","road transport","road travel","road traffic","higher cumulative incidence","significant impacts","epidemic processes","epidemics","city","epidemic duration","regions","number of slaughtered pigs","pandemic influenza virus","national highway network","epidemic arrival time","person income","person GDP","epidemiological variables","epidemiological features","larger SumRatio","significant relationships","virus infections","mainland China","spatial autoregression","Chinese cities","Spatial variation","classic ones","majority","college students","hospitals","colleges","responses","imported cases","differences","conclusion","prevention","control of future pandemics","correlation","roles","migration","outbreak","people","transportation","results","attention","daily commuting"],"language":"en"},

Thus, 132 nasopharyngeal samples were collected from pilgrims presenting with acute respiratory symptoms at the healthcare facilities in the holy sites during the 5 days of the 2014 Hajj season. Samples were tested using real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions and microarray. Demographic data including age, sex, and country of origin were obtained for all participants. While we did not detect MERS\u2010CoV in any of the samples, several other viruses were detected in 50.8% of the cases. Among the detected viruses, 64.2% of the cases were due to a single\u2010virus infection and 35.8% were due to the coinfections with up to four viruses. The most common respiratory virus was influenza A, followed by non\u2010MERS human coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and influenza B. Together, we found that it was not MERS\u2010CoV but other respiratory viruses that caused acute respiratory symptoms among pilgrims. The observed high prevalence of influenza viruses underscores the need for more effective surveillance during the Hajj and adoption of stringent vaccination requirements from all pilgrims.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashem, Anwar M.; Al\u2010Subhi, Tagreed L.; Badroon, Nassrin A.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Bajrai, Leena Hussein M.; Banassir, Talib M.; Alquthami, Khalid M.; Azhar, Esam I.","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5cb1b9d374e8fff8a1aa694308406d0069942f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166944.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30729547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B.

ADEM typically resolves following medical treatment, whereas MS follows a more relapsing and remitting course. The pathogenesis of MS remains unclear, but it is thought that a combination of infectious and non-infectious environmental factors and host genetics act synergistically to cause disease. A variety of viruses, including Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus, have been implicated as possible infectious triggers. The similar clinical and pathological presentation of ADEM and MS presents a diagnostic challenge for distinguishing ADEM from a first episode of MS. Some cases of ADEM progress to MS for reasons that are not currently clear.

Inflammation of the oral cavity may involve the buccal mucosa, the gingiva (gingivitis), the tongue (glossitis), and the peridontal tissues (peridontitis). Therapeutic agents can induce inflammatory lesions in the tongue. Moreover, a protective layer of mucus, a visco-elastic material containing high molecular weight glycoproteins produced by the major and minor salivary glands, covers the stratified squamous mucosa of the oral cavity. Salivary secretions also possess digestive enzyme activity although in herbivores and carnivores, it is usually low in contrast to high digestive enzyme activity in omnivorous species.","publish_time":"2000-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greaves, Peter","journal":"Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/529fe033afc5b8f83c55aa6b8f034fd506bf7b9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444505149500073; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444505149500073","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral cavity","oral mucosa","Salivary secretions","minor salivary glands","high digestive enzyme activity","buccal mucosa","digestive system","tongue","stratified squamous mucosa","protective mechanism","protective layer of mucus","high molecular weight glycoproteins","visco-elastic material","well-described phenomena","human studies","Drug-induced abnormalities of taste sensation","gingivitis","contrast","omnivorous species","derangement of saliva production","loss of integrity","detection","inflammatory lesions","glossitis","chapter","carnivores","gingiva","herbivores","peridontal tissues","Therapeutic agents","Publisher Summary","peridontitis","effects","Inflammation"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, the pace is much slower in determining their biological attributes. As a consequence, the gap between sequence-known proteins and attribute-known proteins has become increasingly large. The unbalanced situation, which has critically limited our ability to timely utilize the newly discovered proteins for basic research and drug development, has called for developing computational methods or high-throughput automated tools for fast and reliably identifying various attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. Actually, during the last two decades or so, many methods in this regard have been established in hope to bridge such a gap. In the course of developing these methods, the following things were often needed to consider: (1) benchmark dataset construction, (2) protein sample formulation, (3) operating algorithm (or engine), (4) anticipated accuracy, and (5) web-server establishment. In this review, we are to discuss each of the five procedures, with a special focus on the introduction of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), its different modes and applications as well as its recent development, particularly in how to use the general formulation of PseAAC to reflect the core and essential features that are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences.","publish_time":"2011-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4ba4eaec59274c79ba7eebce7b6c3351827a017.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125570.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.12.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21168420/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002251931000679X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931000679X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discovered proteins","various attributes of uncharacterized proteins","number of sequence","computational methods","sequence information","gap","general formulation of PseAAC","protein sample formulation","drug development","recent development","biological attributes","complicated protein sequences","introduction of pseudo amino acid composition","high-throughput automated tools","accomplishment of human genome sequencing","basic research","special focus","applications","core","different modes","Abstract","essential features","benchmark dataset construction","web-server establishment","contrast","pace","procedures","algorithm","hope","regard","following things","consequence","unbalanced situation","engine","accuracy","ability","decades","course","review"],"language":"en"},

It is well established that social support has been related to the onset of PTSD after natural disasters. However, very little is known whether or not social support has had an influence on the recovery from the PTSD that was diagnosed after floods. This study, therefore, made a follow-up assessment of PTSD in flood victims 13\u201314 years after they were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of PTSD among them and identify the association between social support and their recovery from PTSD. METHODS: Victims who had experienced Dongting Lake flood in 1998 and had been diagnosed as having PTSD in 2000 were enrolled in this study. A follow-up survey was done between the years 2013 and 2014 to diagnose the victims again of PTSD using the DSM-IV criteria. Social support and its three dimensions were measured using the Chinese version of Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), including objective support, subjective support and support utilization. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between social support and the recovery from PTSD after flood. RESULTS: Out of 321 subjects with prior PTSD, 51 (15.89 %) were diagnosed as still having PTSD. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the recovery from prior PTSD was significantly associated with social support (odds ratio (OR) =0.202, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI): 0.047\u20130.878), subjective support (OR = 0.236, 95 % CI: 0.080\u20130.694) and support utilization (OR = 0.245, 95 % CI: 0.071\u20130.844). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of current PTSD indicates that natural disasters, such as floods, may affect the mental health of victims for a long time. Social support was significantly associated with the recovery from prior PTSD, especially subjective support and support utilization.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Wenjie; Chen, Long; Tan, Hongzhuan; Wang, Jieru; Lai, Zhiwei; Kaminga, Atipatsa C.; Li, Yan; Liu, Aizhong","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af2e81683f4a37a0ada4acd6fbc495550306c86f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4770534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924178/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-016-2871-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTSD","Social Support"],"locations":["Dongting Lake"],"keyphrases":["subjective support","support utilization","prior PTSD","objective support","onset of PTSD","prevalence rate of PTSD","follow-up assessment of PTSD","recovery","prevalence rate of current PTSD","Chinese version of Social Support Rating Scale","flood victims","mental health of victims","natural disasters","floods","years","study","multivariate logistic regression analyses","experienced Dongting Lake flood","follow-up survey","survivors of traumatic events","Post-traumatic stress disorder","SSRS","prevalent long-term psychiatric disorders","face-to-face interviews","BACKGROUND","dimensions","relationship","influence","association","long time","structured questionnaire","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","subjects","DSM","odds ratio","Data","confidence interval","criteria","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Our civilization will continue to face the emergence of new pathogens and viruses: viruses will continue to evolve and adapt to new environments at a high rate; our population continues to grow through birth rate, land development, and migration; climate change will continue to increase the vector burden and spread and change the migratory pattern of animals; and our societal mobility will continue to increase through rapid transportation. The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history, calculation of an incubation time by exposure, and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness, which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered. Ultimately, the proper identification and diagnosis of a patient with a viral febrile illness due to an emerging pathogen will elicit the appropriate precautions to protect health care providers and communities, deliver appropriate therapeutic interventions, and initiate a targeted public health response.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Endy, Timothy P.","journal":"Hunter\u0027s Tropical Medicine and Emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78b24a96d872199e62f5ab757eedaaaf453588e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151808.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323555128000363; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323555128000363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging pathogen","viral pathogens","viral febrile illness","potential emerging viral pathogen","febrile patient","clinical illness","viruses","emergence of new pathogens","appropriate precautions","birth rate","high rate","differential diagnosis","new environments","clinical evaluation","climate change","appropriate therapeutic interventions","health care providers","targeted public health response","calculation","communities","emerged diseases","global pandemics","land development","detailed travel history","incubation time","migration","likelihood","significant morbidity","large epidemics","understanding","exposure","infection","population","disease progression","migratory pattern of animals","societal mobility","mortality","type of diagnostics","proper identification","vector burden","rapid transportation"],"language":"en"},

The Health Insurance Review \u0026 Assessment Service (HIRA) has run a Healthcare Utilization Monitoring System (HUMS) since 2008. The objective of this paper is to introduce HIRA\u0027s HUMS. METHODS: This study described the HUMS\u0027s system structure, capacity, functionalities, and output formats run by HIRA in the Republic of Korea. Regarding output formats, this study extracted diabetes related health insurance claims through the HUMS from August 1, 2014 to May 31, 2015. RESULTS: The HUMS has kept records of health insurance claim data for 4 years. It has a 14-terabyte hardware capacity and employs several easy-to-use programs for maintenance of the system, such as MSTR, SAS, etc. Regarding functionalities, users should input diseases codes, target periods, facility types, and types of attributes, such as the number of healthcare utilizations or healthcare costs. It also has a functionality to predict healthcare utilization and costs. When this study extracted diabetes related data, it was found that the trend of healthcare costs for the treatment of diabetes and the number of patients with diabetes were increasing. CONCLUSIONS: HIRA\u0027s HUMS works well to monitor healthcare utilization of patients at the national level. The HUMS has a high-capacity hardware infrastructure and several operational programs that allows easy access to summaries as well as details to identify contributing factors for abnormality, but it has a limitation in that there is often a time lag between the provision of healthcare to patients and the filing of health claims.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Hyun Chul; Park, Young-Taek; Lee, Youn Tae; Jo, Emmanuel C.","journal":"Healthc Inform Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d9704846cfede2072a22a22c7bfcd99c0470d11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4532843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279955/; https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2015.21.3.184","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare Utilization Monitoring System","HIRA","MSTR"],"locations":["Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["healthcare utilization of patients","provision of healthcare","trend of healthcare costs","Healthcare Utilization Monitoring System","number of healthcare utilizations","HIRA\u0027s HUMS","nation\u0027s healthcare sector","diabetes related health insurance claims","study","number of patients","Health Insurance Review","diabetes related data","treatment of diabetes","filing of health claims","records of health insurance claim data","functionalities","terabyte hardware capacity","national level","output formats","high-capacity hardware infrastructure","HUMS\u0027s system structure","operational programs","easy-to-use programs","facility types","types of attributes","diseases codes","target periods","evidence-based policy decisions","details","users","Assessment Service","easy access","abnormality","summaries","SAS","years","contributing factors","MSTR","maintenance","time lag","paper","functionality","Republic of Korea","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","limitation","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

These autoAb bound mainly to N- and C-terminal FAH peptides, the most reactive sequences being 1\u201350 and 390\u2013420, respectively. Surprisingly, although FAH sequence 1\u201350 shares a high degree of homology with various MHV proteins, the C-terminal portion does not. Moreover, whereas the autoAb reacted with homologous peptides surrounding residues 70, 160 and 360, non-similar sequences around residues 130, 210, 240, 250, and 300 were also recognized, indicating that autoAb were not restricted to epitopes with sequence homologies. There was also a lack of correlation between the amount of anti-MHV or anti-FAH antibodies produced and the reactivity towards the peptides. Moreover, the spectrum of peptides recognized by the autoAb of a given mouse did not change significantly with time, which suggests that the MHV-elicited autoimmune response does not induce an epitope recognition spreading. Finally, anti-FAH Ab produced after immunization with rat liver FAH recognized essentially the same mouse FAH regions than autoAb from MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that the induction of the autoAb is not only related to molecular or structural mimicry, but rather supports the Danger model, in which any aggression, in this case the MHV infection, is susceptible to trigger the production of autoAb.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duhalde-Vega, Maite; Loureiro, Mar\u00EDa E.; Mathieu, Patricia A.; Retegui, Lilia A.","journal":"J Autoimmun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb0b9e2693f78bf4cbfe7b71c5d9e8ba323352e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125834.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841106000783; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841106000783","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FAH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FAH sequence","anti-MHV","production of autoAb","mouse FAH regions","C-terminal FAH peptides","anti-FAH Ab","anti-FAH antibodies","MHV infection","rat liver FAH","MHV-infected mice","various MHV proteins","given mouse","homologous peptides","spectrum of peptides","entire sequence of mouse liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase","mouse hepatitis virus","residues","sequence homologies","C-terminal portion","reactive sequences","non-similar sequences","immunization","high degree of homology","aggression","case","enzyme","reactivity","autoimmune response","epitopes","structural mimicry","Danger model","epitope recognition","Synthetic decapeptides","lack of correlation","induction","specificities","autoantibodies","time","Results"],"language":"en"},

These infections are usually asymptomatic in bats but the mechanism of this tolerance is not yet understood. For those viruses, bats are efficient reservoirs and disseminators.

Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or \u226558 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or \u201Cother\u201D), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between \u00A315,000 and \u00A374,999. US and UK participants\u2019 median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was \u201Chighly effective\u201D in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public\u2019s knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geldsetzer, Pascal","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124956.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","US"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["US participants","distribution of participants","number of participants","substantial proportion of participants","UK general population","United States","online questionnaire","United Kingdom","rapid online surveys","total household income","general public","online research","rapid online surveying","perceptions of coronavirus disease","adults","UK participants\u2019 median estimate","representative household survey","track knowledge","public\u2019s knowledge","good knowledge","fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks","fatal disease course","main mode of disease transmission","common symptoms of COVID","Prolific Academic established strata","SARS-CoV","acquiring COVID","IQR","public health authorities","Asian Indian","low response rate of phone surveys","common surgical mask","tertiary education degree","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","probability","information campaigns","important tool","promising method","ethnicity","clinicians","misperceptions","female","misconceptions","age","study","children","high risk of death","recommended care","sex","infection","extensive time","BACKGROUND","behavior","years","Enrollment","stratum","METHODS","findings","CONCLUSIONS","Chinese restaurants","OBJECTIVE","permutations","RESULTS","basis","instance","half"],"language":"en"},

It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children. Some trials suggest that preemptive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroids. Since wheeze is intermittent for the majority of children, preemptive therapy is a logical approach. However, more studies are needed to confirm whether preemptive inhaled corticosteroids are as, or more, effective than regular preventer therapy.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grigg, Jonathan; Ducharme, Francine M.","journal":"Kendig\u0027s Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31d72f1d4bc8d1232c2f50b2320796b68b3fec14.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323448871000444; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323448871000444","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preemptive therapy","preschool wheeze","preemptive inhaled corticosteroids","effective preventive therapy","preschool children","regular inhaled corticosteroids","majority of children","Abstract Wheeze","causes of wheeze","daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy","regular preventer therapy","subgroup of children","acute treatment of wheeze","optimal management of children","majority of severe episodes","current evidence","atypical features","young people","cystic fibrosis","foreign body aspiration","adults","years of age","underlying pathology","atopic asthma","careful history","examination","serious conditions","significant uncertainties","logical approach","viral colds","Short-acting bronchodilators","trials","diagnosis","description of symptoms","label","studies"],"language":"en"},

Health Care Personnel (HCP) are at high risk of acquiring MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections first identified in 2003. This study described the similarities and differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 183 confirmed global MERS cases and 98 SARS cases in Taiwan associated with HCP. The epidemiological findings showed that the mean age of MERS-HCP and total MERS cases were 40 (24~74) and 49 (2~90) years, respectively, much older than those in SARS [SARS-HCP: 35 (21~68) years, p = 0.006; total SARS: 42 (0~94) years, p = 0.0002]. The case fatality rates (CFR) was much lower in MERS-HCP [7.03% (9/128)] or SARS-HCP [12.24% (12/98)] than the MERS-non-HCP [36.96% (34/92), p\u003C0.001] or SARS-non-HCP [24.50% (61/249), p\u003C0.001], however, no difference was found between MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP [p = 0.181]. In terms of clinical period, the days from onset to death [13 (4~17) vs 14.5 (0~52), p = 0.045] and to discharge [11 (5~24) vs 24 (0~74), p = 0.010] and be hospitalized days [9.5 (3~22) vs 22 (0~69), p = 0.040] were much shorter in MERS-HCP than SARS-HCP. Similarly, days from onset to confirmation were shorter in MERS-HCP than MERS-non-HCP [6 (1~14) vs 10 (1~21), p = 0.044]. In conclusion, the severity of MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP was lower than that of MERS-non-HCP and SARS-non-HCP due to younger age and early confirmation in HCP groups. However, no statistical difference was found in MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP. Thus, prevention of nosocomial infections involving both novel Coronavirus is crucially important to protect HCP.","publish_time":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shelan; Chan, Ta-Chien; Chu, Yu-Tseng; Wu, Joseph Tsung-Shu; Geng, Xingyi; Zhao, Na; Cheng, Wei; Chen, Enfu; King, Chwan-Chuen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4773072.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Care Personnel","HCP"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea","Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["MERS-HCP","SARS-HCP","MERS-non-HCP","SARS-non-HCP","HCP groups","MERS-CoV","severity of MERS","SARS cases","SARS-CoV","total SARS","total MERS cases","mean age of MERS","confirmed global MERS cases","high risk of acquiring MERS-Coronavirus","vs","days","years","novel Coronavirus","prevention of nosocomial infections","onset","younger age","severe acute respiratory syndrome","clinical characteristics","early confirmation","epidemiological findings","largest nosocomial outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome","statistical difference","terms of clinical period","differences","CFR","similarities","Taiwan","case fatality rates","Health Care Personnel","South Korea","study","death","conclusion","discharge"],"language":"en"},

The precise biological role of protein IX remains enigmatic. Here we show that deletion of the protein IX gene from a HAdV-5 vector enhanced the reporter gene delivery 5 to 25-fold, specifically to Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR)-negative cell lines. Deletion of the protein IX gene also resulted in enhanced activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mechanism for the enhanced transduction is obscure. No differences in fiber loading, integrin-dependency of transduction, or factor-X binding could be established between protein IX-containing and protein IX-deficient particles. Our data suggest that protein IX can affect the cell tropism of HAdV-5, and may function to dampen the innate immune responses against HAdV particles.","publish_time":"2011-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Vrij, Jeroen; van den Hengel, Sanne K.; Uil, Taco G.; Koppers-Lalic, Danijela; Dautzenberg, Iris J.C.; Stassen, Oscar M.J.A.; B\u00E1rcena, Montserrat; Yamamoto, Masato; de Ridder, Corrina M.A.; Kraaij, Robert; Kwappenberg, Kitty M.; Schilham, Marco W.; Hoeben, Rob C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3a1e33a44baf0d1636040ed2b7ef4dce2d14364.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111976.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.10.040; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210007026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21130482/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210007026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-terminal domains of protein","kDa minor capsid protein","precise biological role of protein","HAdV particles","enhanced transduction","cell tropism of HAdV","deletion","C-terminal domains","reporter gene delivery","deficient particles","enhanced activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","negative cell lines","CAR","form triskelions","Adenovirus Receptor","integrin-dependency","monomers","vector","fiber loading","Coxsackie","fold","copies","hexon capsomers","factor-X binding","innate immune responses","human adenoviruses","differences","Abstract","mechanism","facet periphery","data"],"language":"en"},

Changes in the shape of subepithelial OX6 (anti-MHC class II)-immunoreactive cells were evident in the tracheal mucosa 2 days after intranasal inoculation with M. pulmonis. By 1 week, the shape of the cells had changed from stellate to rounded (mean shape index increased from 0.42 to 0.77).

Tobacco during pregnancy but not a history of family asthma was significantly associated to lower expiratory flows; however, the association was significant only when infants were asymptomatic. Conclusion This study shows that common colds cause a marked reduction of lung function in infants with RW.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mallol, J.; Aguirre, V.; Wandalsen, G.","journal":"Allergologia et Immunopathologia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25d52e9f703bf986233805d21b66afb59e8d40fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117020.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19945208/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aller.2009.10.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301054609001098; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301054609001098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung function of infants","RW","common colds","majority of infants","effect of colds","raised lung volume","extent of lung function decrease","marked reduction of lung function","Methods Spirometric lung function","lower expiratory flows","forced expiratory parameters","effect of common cold","significant decrease","association","study","history of family asthma","tobacco exposure","Abstract Background Common acute viral respiratory infections","frequent cause of exacerbations","recurrent wheezing","FEF50","factors","z-score","FEF75","pregnancy","quantitative information","Conclusion","FEF25"],"language":"en"},

A six-year-old male European short-hair cat from Austria presented poor general condition, lethargy, anorexia, icterus, a painful abdomen, fever, ruffled hair and a tick infestation, and it had never left Austria. Laboratory tests revealed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and increased serum levels of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and bilirubin. In May Gr\u00FCnwald-Giemsa-stained blood smears, structures resembling Hepatozoon gamonts were observed inside neutrophil granulocytes. A PCR targeting a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. and DNA sequencing allowed the diagnosis of H. felis-DNA in blood samples. The cat was treated with imidocarb dipropionate (6 mg/kg body weight, repeated after 14 days) and doxycycline monohydrate (5 mg/kg body weight twice a day, p.o., for four weeks) and recovered completely. A broad haematological and biochemical laboratory control after six months showed all evaluated parameters under normal ranges.

It exerts profound activity on vital processes such as immune response, cellular growth, and blood pressure control. Inhibition of either APN gene expression or its enzymatic activity severely affects leukocyte growth and function. We show here that oxidoreductase-mediated modulations of the cell surface thiol status affect the enzymatic activity of APN. Additional evidence for the pivotal role of extracellular cysteines in the APN molecule was obtained when substitution of any of these six cysteines caused complete loss of surface expression and enzymatic activity. In contrast, the transmembrane Cys24 appears to have no similar function. Enzymatically inactive cysteine mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by high-resolution imaging and Endoglycosidase H digestion. In the absence of any crystal-structure data, the demonstration that individual extracellular cysteines contribute to APN expression and function appears to be of particular importance. The data are the first to show thiol-dependent modulation of the activity of a typical surface-bound peptidase at the cell surface, probably reflecting a general regulating mechanism.

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and data were prospectively collected from 145 children (median age = 23.5 months, interquartile range [IQR] 8.7\u201350) hospitalised with pneumonia at Alice Springs Hospital, Australia, between April 2001 and July 2002.

Current antiviral treatments target viral proteins and may be compromised due to the emergence of drug resistant viral strains. Targeting viral\u2010host interactions is now gaining recognition as an alternative approach against viral infections. Recent research has revealed that heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1, an RNA\u2010binding protein, plays an essential functional and regulatory role in the life cycle of many viruses. In this review, we summarize the interactions between heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) and multiple viral proteins during the life cycle of RNA and DNA viruses. hnRNPA1 protein levels are modulated differently, in different viruses, which further dictates its stability, function, and intracellular localization. Multiple reports have emphasized that in Sindbis virus, enteroviruses, porcine endemic diarrhea virus, and rhinovirus infection, hnRNPA1 enhances viral replication and survival. However, in others like hepatitis C virus and human T\u2010cell lymphotropic virus, it exerts a protective response. The involvement of hnRNPA1 in viral infections highlights its importance as a central regulator of host and viral gene expression. Understanding the nature of these interactions will increase our understanding of specific viral infections and pathogenesis and eventually aid in the development of novel and robust antiviral intervention strategies.","publish_time":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaur, Ramandeep; Lal, Sunil K.","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10a348db9547e1b4aeaf14976fc6e5e33989d7cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169068.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication","multiple viral proteins","understanding of specific viral infections","viral gene expression","host interactions","different viruses","emergence of drug resistant viral strains","Sindbis virus","involvement of hnRNPA1","DNA viruses","hnRNPA1 protein levels","cell lymphotropic virus","hepatitis C virus","life cycle of RNA","heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1","wide variety of host proteins","porcine endemic diarrhea virus","central regulator of host","different stages of infection","rhinovirus infection","binding protein","Multiple reports","Current antiviral treatments","robust antiviral intervention strategies","human T","enteroviruses","importance","development of novel","regulatory role","pathogenesis","recognition","stability","alternative approach","Recent research","function","intracellular localization","survival","obligate parasites","protective response","review","nature"],"language":"en"},

Molecular assays have been the gold standard to directly detect for the presence of viral genetic material in infected individuals. However, insufficient viral RNA at the point of detection may lead to false negative results. As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one\u0027s exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments.

The current trial served to further investigate I-C in patients with early common cold symptoms. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase IV trial was conducted in 200 adult patients with self-diagnosed colds of \u003C48 h\u2019 duration that were confirmed by baseline cold symptom scores. Patients were to self-administer 0.12 % I-C or placebo spray (NaCl 0.5 %) four times daily for four to ten days and record symptom information for ten days. Common respiratory viruses were quantified by RT-PCR during pretreatment and on Day 3 or 4. The primary endpoint was the mean total symptom score (TSS) of eight cold symptoms on Days 2\u20134 (TSS(2\u20134)). RESULTS: Patients in both treatment groups had similar baseline TSSs (mean TSS: 6.75 for I-C and 6.79 for placebo). Viruses were detected in baseline samples from 53 of 98 I-C patients (54.1 %) and 54 of 97 placebo patients (55.7 %). Mean \u00B1 SE for TSS(2\u20134) was 5.78 \u00B1 0.25 for I-C patients and 6.39 \u00B1 0.25 for placebo (p = 0.0895). Exploratory analyses after unblinding (TSS(2\u20134) excluding a patient with aberrantly high symptom scores [TSS(2\u20134, ex 1pt)]; mean of TSS over Days 1\u20134 [TSS(1\u20134)]; change in TSS(1\u20134) relative to baseline [TSS(1\u20134, rel)]) demonstrated treatment differences in favor of I-C (p = 0.0364, p = 0.0495 and p = 0.0421, respectively). For patients with quantifiable rhinovirus/enterovirus at baseline, there was a trend towards greater reduction of virus load at Day 3 or 4 (p = 0.0958; I-C: 90.2 % reduction in viral load; placebo: 72.0 %). Treatments were well tolerated with no differences in adverse event rates. CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between I-C and placebo but showed a trend towards I-C benefit. Exploratory analyses indicated significant reduction of cold symptoms in the I-C group relative to placebo during the first four days when symptoms were most severe, and also substantiated I-C\u2019s activity against rhinovirus/enterovirus.

CONCLUSION: hDPP4 transgenic mice were successfully infected with MERS\u2010CoV aerosols via an animal nose\u2010only exposure device, and aerosol\u2010 and instillation\u2010infected mice simulated the clinical symptoms of moderate diffuse interstitial pneumonia. However, the transgenic mice exposed to aerosol MERS\u2010CoV developed disease and lung pathology progressions that more closely resembled those observed in humans.","publish_time":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Xin\u2010yan; Lv, Qi; Li, Feng\u2010di; Xu, Yan\u2010feng; Gao, Hong","journal":"Animal Model Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a94fd30a8dfce024118696e454bbe0f0e41840d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6930991.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31942559/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["infected mice","aerosol MERS","inoculated mice","CoV instillation","challenged mice","hDPP4 transgenic mice","CoV aerosols","consecutive days","high viral loads","clinical aerosol transmission route","viral antigen distribution","viral replication progressions","instillation groups","obvious lung lesions","lung pathology progressions","clinical signs","animal nose","exposure device","Disease","lungs","survival","brain","high levels of proinflammatory cytokines","continuous weight loss","clinical symptoms of moderate diffuse interstitial pneumonia","certain transmission routes","pathogenesis","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","vaccines","BACKGROUND","specific therapeutics","chemokines","histopathology","global threat","incubation period","regard","public health","tissues","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","METHODS","humans"],"language":"en"},

Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) are associated with a tolerant immune state and may contribute to CMV-replication. However, T-cell subsets such as T-regs and IL-17 producing T-cells (Th-17) are not well studied in this context. We explored T-regs and Th-17 frequencies during CMV-replication after transplantation. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 30 transplant patients with CMV-viremia. We quantified CMV-specific CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T-cells, T-regs (CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B)FoxP3(\u002B)) and Th-17 frequencies using flow-cytometry and followed patients requiring anti-viral treatment. Two subsets were compared: anti-viral treatment requirement (n = 20) vs. spontaneous clearance of viremia (n = 10). RESULTS: Higher initial CMV-specific CD4(\u002B) T-cells and lower T-regs were observed in patients with spontaneous clearance (p = 0.043; p = 0.021 respectively). Using a ratio of CMV-specific CD4(\u002B) T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of viral clearance with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity (p = 0.001). One month after stop of treatment, the same correlation was observed in patients protected from CMV-relapse. The ratio of CMV-specific CD4(\u002B) T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of relapse with 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity (p = 0.004). Th-17 responses were not correlated with virologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into T-regs and Th-17 subpopulations during CMV-replication after transplantation. These preliminary data suggest that measurement of CMV-specific CD4(\u002B) T-cells together with T-regs has value in predicting spontaneous clearance of viremia and relapse.","publish_time":"2012-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Egli, Adrian; Silva, Moacyr; O\u0027Shea, Daire; Wilson, Leticia E.; Baluch, Aliyah; Lisboa, Luiz F.; Hidalgo, Luis G.; Kumar, Deepali; Humar, Atul","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e57993034cb1196b96daff4505db38640782f4a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3469568.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0043937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23071829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV-specific T-cells","lower T-regs","Regulatory T-cells","CMV-viremia","CMV-relapse","T-cell subsets","ratio of CMV","measurement of CMV","Higher initial CMV-specific CD4","control CMV-replication post-transplant","spontaneous clearance of viremia","prediction of viral clearance","transplant patients","prediction of relapse","anti-viral treatment requirement","sensitivity","frequencies","transplantation","specificity","novel insights","subpopulations","value","flow-cytometry","study","RESULTS","CD8","IL","CONCLUSIONS","responses","tolerant immune state","preliminary data","CD25","BACKGROUND","virologic outcomes","FoxP3","correlation","METHODS","month","context"],"language":"en"},

The Orsay virus and its related nematode viruses have a positive-sense RNA genome, encoding three proteins: CP, RdRP, and a novel \u03B4 protein that shares no homology with any other proteins. \u03B4 can be expressed either as a free \u03B4 or a CP-\u03B4 fusion protein by ribosomal frameshift, but the structure and function of both \u03B4 and CP-\u03B4 remain unknown. Using a combination of electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, computational and biophysical analyses, here we show that the Orsay \u03B4 protein forms a ~420-\u00C5 long, pentameric fiber with an N-terminal \u03B1-helical bundle, a \u03B2-stranded filament in the middle, and a C-terminal head domain. The pentameric nature of the \u03B4 fiber has been independently confirmed by both mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. Recombinant Orsay capsid containing CP-\u03B4 shows protruding long fibers with globular heads at the distal end. Mutant viruses with disrupted CP-\u03B4 fibers were generated by organism-based reverse genetics. These viruses were found to be either non-viable or with poor infectivity according to phenotypic and qRT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, addition of purified \u03B4 proteins to worm culture greatly reduced Orsay infectivity in a sequence-specific manner. Based on the structure resemblance between the Orsay CP-\u03B4 fiber and the fibers from reovirus and adenovirus, we propose that CP-\u03B4 functions as a cell attachment protein to mediate Orsay entry into worm intestine cells.","publish_time":"2017-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Yanlin; Guo, Yusong R.; Yuan, Wang; Zhou, Ying; Holt, Matthew V.; Wang, Tao; Demeler, Borries; Young, Nicolas L.; Zhong, Weiwei; Tao, Yizhi J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6efcaa639a97ba506cf341230c166208d1312a11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5344674.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombinant Orsay"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Orsay \u03B4 protein","Orsay CP-\u03B4 fiber","CP-\u03B4 functions","free \u03B4","CP-\u03B4 fusion protein","disrupted CP-\u03B4 fibers","novel \u03B4 protein","addition of purified \u03B4 proteins","Orsay virus","Orsay entry","reduced Orsay infectivity","Recombinant Orsay capsid","pentameric fiber","cell attachment protein","protruding long fibers","Mutant viruses","model organism","related nematode viruses","poor infectivity","biophysical analyses","structure resemblance","pentameric nature","qRT-PCR analyses","worm intestine cells","C-terminal head domain","N-terminal \u03B1-helical bundle","X-ray crystallography","globular heads","ribosomal frameshift","culture","positive-sense RNA genome","\u03B2-stranded filament","middle","combination of electron microscopy","RdRP","wide use of Caenorhabditis elegans","sequence-specific manner","reovirus","homology","distal end","mass spectrometry","analytical ultracentrifugation","adenovirus","reverse genetics","years"],"language":"en"},

The evolution and spread of SARS has resulted in an international effort coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). We have formulated a discrete mathematical model to investigate the transmission of SARS and determined the basic reproductive number for this model to use as a threshold to determine the asymptotic behavior of the model. The dependence of the basic reproductive number on epidemic parameters has been studied. The parameters of the model have been estimated on the basis of statistical data and numerical simulations have been carried out to describe the transmission process for SARS in China. The simulation results matches the statistical data well and indicate that early quarantine and a high quarantine rate are crucial to the control of SARS.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yicang; Ma, Zhien; Brauer, F.","journal":"Mathematical and Computer Modelling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75fffe385341bfc549542beb0cf1d140a7e30d71.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895717705000099; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895717705000099; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2005.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["transmission of SARS","control of SARS","basic reproductive number","early quarantine","discrete mathematical model","basis of statistical data","international effort","transmission process","epidemic parameters","high quarantine rate","medium of international travel","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","numerical simulations","World Health Organization","countries","threshold","asymptotic behavior","simulation results","China","dependence","infectious disease","evolution"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Pathological consequences of a severe outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1 virus) in the non immune sow at the beginning of pregnancy, under natural conditions. A sudden acute outbreak of fever, depression, anorexia and coughing in a group of nulliparous sows from a herd that was currently under epidemiological investigation lead to build a particular disposal of observation. The clinical signs were daily recorded including rectal temperature. Blood was taken from the sows at the beginning of the troubles and 3 weeks later for the detection of Aujesky\u0027s disease, coronavirus TGE-like, Influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Viral detection was attempted from nasal swabs and aborted fetuses during the acute phase. The clinical study showed fever reaching near 41\u00B0C on most of the pigs and lasting usually from 2 to 5 days. The diagnosis of Influenza (virus swine H1N1) was established both on serology (massive seroconversion) and on the detection of the virus from the nasal swabs and from an aborted fetus. The control of the lungs of sows \u201Cnot in pig\u201D and culled showed extended lesions of bronchopneumonia and Pasteurella multocida was found. The technical consequences of this severe outbreak of Influenza on reproduction were mainly important at the beginning of pregnancy. Over 13 sows inseminated less than 1 week before the outbreak, only 3 farrowed (respectively 5,5 and 12 piglets); 7 returned to oestrus and 3 \u201Cnot a pig\u201D at 21 days (echotomography) did not show signs of heat and were culled. Over 8 pregnant sows (1 month of pregnancy), 6 farrowed normal litters and total embryonic resorption occurred in 2 sows. Over 18 pregnant sows (more than 45 days gestation) one aborted.","publish_time":"1989-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madec, F.; Kaiser, Cl.; Gourreau, J.

Little is known about how the human astrovirus (HAstV) exploits signaling cascades to establish an infection in host cells. Recent studies showed that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is important for HAstV infection, though the involvement of other signaling cascades remains unclear. METHODS: A panel of kinase blockers was used to search for cellular signaling pathways important for HAstV1 infection. To determine their impact on the infectious process, we examined viral gene expression, RNA replication, and viral RNA and capsid protein release from host cells. RESULTS: Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation interfered with the infection, independent of their effect on ERK 1/2 activation. Activation of the PI3K signaling cascade occurred at an early phase of the infection, judging from the timeframe of Akt phosphorylation. PI3K inhibition at early times, but not at later times, blocked viral gene expression. However, inhibiting the downstream targets of PI3K activation, Akt and Rac1, did not block infection. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) activation was found to block a later phase of HAstV1 production. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a previously unknown, essential role of PI3K in the life cycle of HAstV1. PI3K participates in the early stage of infection, possibly during the viral entry process. Our results also reveal the role of PKA in viral production.","publish_time":"2013-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tange, Shoichiro; Zhou, Yan; Nagakui-Noguchi, Yuko; Imai, Takeshi; Nakanishi, Akira","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d20ab75d7394461e9acd16899bd55902177d8fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3750554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23680019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ERK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAstV1 infection","viral RNA","viral production","HAstV infection","viral propagation","PI3K inhibition","viral gene expression","viral entry process","early stage of infection","downstream targets of PI3K activation","host cells","essential role of PI3K","cascades","RESULTS","Inhibition of protein kinase","activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase","early times","early phase","later phase of HAstV1 production","later times","role of PKA","panel of kinase blockers","life cycle of HAstV1","RNA replication","series of cellular","infectious process","pathways important","capsid protein release","timeframe of Akt phosphorylation","exploits","initial contact","ERK1","effect","involvement","Rac1","human astrovirus","Recent studies","Inhibitors of phosphoinositide","METHODS","BACKGROUND","impact","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is associated with severe morbidity. Although RSV RNA has been detected in serum from patients with RSV lower respiratory disease (LRD) after HCT, the association with clinical outcomes has not been well established in multivariable models. Additionally, the role of antiviral treatment in HCT recipients has not been previously analyzed in multivariable models. Methods. We retrospectively identified HCT recipients with virologically confirmed RSV LRD and tested stored plasma/serum samples by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for RSV RNA. Risk factors for RSV RNA detection and the impact of RSV RNA in serum and antiviral therapy on outcomes were analyzed using multivariable Cox models. Results. RSV RNA was detected in plasma or serum from 28 of 92 (30%) patients at a median of 24.5 days following HCT and 2 days following LRD. In multivariable models, neutropenia, monocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of plasma/serum RSV RNA detection; lymphopenia and steroid use did not. RSV RNA detection increased the risk of overall mortality in multivariable models (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.09 [P = .02]), whereas treatment with aerosolized ribavirin decreased the risk of overall mortality and pulmonary death (aHR, 0.33 [P = .001] and aHR 0.31 [P = .003], respectively). Conclusions. RSV RNA detection in plasma or serum may be a marker for lung injury and poor outcomes in HCT recipients with RSV LRD. Treatment with aerosolized ribavirin appeared to be protective against overall and pulmonary mortality.","publish_time":"2013-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waghmare, Alpana; Campbell, Angela P.; Xie, Hu; Seo, Sachiko; Kuypers, Jane; Leisenring, Wendy; Jerome, Keith R.; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18aec2c3b6e8c5b72d24b6aa29753719627504ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3840404.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cit639; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/57/12/1731/17350990/cit639.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24065324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV RNA","RSV LRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum RSV RNA detection","impact of RSV RNA","confirmed RSV LRD","multivariable models","HCT recipients","risk of plasma","RSV lower respiratory disease","multivariable Cox models","serum samples","risk of overall mortality","aHR","stored plasma","Risk factors","pulmonary mortality","poor outcomes","clinical outcomes","aerosolized ribavirin","role of antiviral treatment","patients","days","antiviral therapy","pulmonary death","Respiratory syncytial virus","quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","pneumonia","monocytopenia","lung injury","marker","adjusted hazard ratio","lymphopenia","hematopoietic cell transplant","thrombocytopenia","mechanical ventilation","steroid use","neutropenia","association","median","severe morbidity","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The slow rates of virus replication prevent many biochemical analyses of HMPV particles. In this study imaging was used to examine the process of HMPV morphogenesis in individually infected LLC-MK2 cells, and to better characterise the sites of HMPV assembly. This strategy has circumvented the problems associated with slow replication rates and allowed us to characterise both the HMPV particles and the sites of HMPV morphogenesis. METHODS: HMPV-infected LLC-MK2 cells were stained with antibodies that recognised the HMPV fusion protein (F protein), attachment protein (G protein) and matrix protein (M protein), and fluorescent probes that detect GM1 within lipid-raft membranes (CTX-B-AF488) and F-actin (Phalloidin-FITC). The stained cells were examined by confocal microscopy, which allowed imaging of F-actin, GM1 and virus particles in HMPV-infected cells. Cells co-expressing recombinant HMPV G and F proteins formed virus-like particles and were co-stained with antibodies that recognise the recombinant G and F proteins and phalloidin-FITC and CTX-B-AF594, and the distribution of the G and F proteins, GM1 and F-actin determined. RESULTS: HMPV-infected cells stained with anti-F, anti-G or anti-M revealed a filamentous staining pattern, indicating that the HMPV particles have a filamentous morphology. Staining of HMPV-infected cells with anti-G and either phalloidin-FITC or CTX-B-AF488 exhibited extensive co-localisation of these cellular probes within the HMPV filaments. This suggested that lipid-raft membrane domains and F-actin structures are present at the site of the virus morphogenesis, and are subsequently incorporated into the HMPV filaments. Furthermore, the filamentous virus-like particles that form in cells expressing the G protein formed in cellular structures containing GM1 and F-actin, suggesting the G protein contains intrinsic targeting signals to the sites of virus assembly. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HMPV matures as filamentous particles and that virus morphogenesis occurs within lipid-raft microdomains containing localized concentrations of F-actin. The similarity between HMPV morphogenesis and the closely related human respiratory syncytial virus suggests that involvement of F-actin and lipid-raft microdomains in virus morphogenesis may be a common feature of the Pneumovirinae.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical course, duration of viral shedding, H1N1pdm evolution and emergence of antiviral resistance in hospitalized cancer patients with severe H1N1pdm infections during the winter of 2009 in Brazil. METHODS: We performed a prospective single-center cohort study in a cancer center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hospitalized patients with cancer and a confirmed diagnosis of influenza A H1N1pdm were evaluated. The main outcome measures in this study were in-hospital mortality, duration of viral shedding, viral persistence and both functional and molecular analyses of H1N1pdm susceptibility to oseltamivir. RESULTS: A total of 44 hospitalized patients with suspected influenza-like illness were screened. A total of 24 had diagnosed H1N1pdm infections. The overall hospital mortality in our cohort was 21%. Thirteen (54%) patients required intensive care. The median age of the studied cohort was 14.5 years (3\u201369 years). Eighteen (75%) patients had received chemotherapy in the previous month, and 14 were neutropenic at the onset of influenza. A total of 10 patients were evaluated for their duration of viral shedding, and 5 (50%) displayed prolonged viral shedding (median 23, range = 11\u201363 days); however, this was not associated with the emergence of a resistant H1N1pdm virus. Viral evolution was observed in sequentially collected samples. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged influenza A H1N1pdm shedding was observed in cancer patients. However, oseltamivir resistance was not detected. Taken together, our data suggest that severely ill cancer patients may constitute a pandemic virus reservoir with major implications for viral propagation.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Souza, Thiago Moreno L.; Salluh, Jorge I.

We determined the reproduction number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by analyzing the dynamics of the complete case series in Mexico City during this early period. Methods We analyzed three mutually exclusive datasets from Mexico City Distrito Federal which constituted all suspect cases from 15 March to 25 April: confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections, non\u2010pandemic influenza A infections and patients who tested negative for influenza. We estimated the initial reproduction number from 497 suspect cases identified prior to 20 April, using a novel contact network methodology incorporating dates of symptom onset and hospitalization, variation in contact rates, extrinsic sociological factors, and uncertainties in underreporting and disease progression. We tested the robustness of this estimate using both the subset of laboratory\u2010confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections and an extended case series through 25 April, adjusted for suspected ascertainment bias. Results The initial reproduction number (95% confidence interval range) for this novel virus is 1\u00B751 (1\u00B732\u20131\u00B771) based on suspected cases and 1\u00B743 (1\u00B729\u20131\u00B757) based on confirmed cases before 20 April. The longer time series (through 25 April) yielded a higher estimate of 2\u00B704 (1\u00B784\u20132\u00B725), which reduced to 1\u00B744 (1\u00B738\u20131\u00B751) after correction for ascertainment bias.

Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future. Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, involve a complex mixture of processes, and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover. In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross-disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics. We identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. If commonalities can be found, then predicting the dynamics of newly emerging diseases may be possible. This modelling approach will be particularly important in scenarios when population surveillance data are unavailable and when it is unclear which aspects of host ecology are driving infection dynamics.","publish_time":"2013-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayman, D T S; Bowen, R A; Cryan, P M; McCracken, G F; O\u2019Shea, T J; Peel, A J; Gilbert, A; Webb, C T; Wood, J L N","journal":"Zoonoses Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fee471a12aa3fbfc3abab41a0f2604906c8acf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3600532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22958281/; https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12000","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogen ecology","Bats","infection dynamics","aspects of host ecology","pathogen traits","aspects of bat ecology","host ecologies","dynamics of emerging bat viruses","ecology of infectious diseases","Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover","emerging diseases","predicting spillover","range of zoonotic","novel hosts","zoonotic pathogens","population surveillance data","long lifespans","emergence","scenarios","gregarious social structures","low fecundity rates","humans","sylvatic disease reservoirs","diverse lifestyles","laboratory studies","combination of field","mechanistic models","complex mixture of processes","ability","Human activities","exposure","complexities","impacts of anthropogenic changes","modelling approach","key questions","Cross-disciplinary approaches","infections","opportunity","future","commonalities"],"language":"en"},

This report describes the molecular cloning and expression analysis of RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 genes in the fruit bat Pteropus alecto, and is the first description of RIG-I like helicases from any species of bat. Our results demonstrate that P. alecto RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 have similar primary structures and tissue expression patterns to their counterparts in humans and other mammals. Stimulation of bat kidney cells with synthetic dsRNA (poly I:C) induced high levels of interferon \u03B2 and rapid upregulation of all three helicases.

Owing to these advantages, several facile aptamer-based colorimetric strategies have been created by controlling the assembly and disassembly of aptamers on unmodified gold nanoparticle probes. As these kinds of assay systems are rapid and can be visualized unaided by instruments, they have recently become an attractive method of choice. The formation of purple-colored aggregates (attraction) from the red dispersed (repulsion) state of GNPs in the presence of mono- or divalent ions is the key principle behind this assay. Due to its simplicity and versatility, this assay can be an alternative to existing diagnostic assays.

There is currently no specific drug for therapeutic treatment or for use as a prophylactic agent against infection and no commercially available vaccine. Prohibitin has been identified as a receptor protein used by chikungunya virus to enter mammalian cells. Recently, synthetic sulfonyl amidines and flavaglines (FLs), a class of naturally occurring plant compounds with potent anti\u2010cancer and cytoprotective and neuroprotective activities, have been shown to interact directly with prohibitin. This study therefore sought to determine whether three prohibitin ligands (sulfonyl amidine 1 m and the flavaglines FL3 and FL23) were able to inhibit CHIKV infection of mammalian Hek293T/17 cells. All three compounds inhibited infection and reduced virus production when cells were treated before infection but not when added after infection. Pretreatment of cells for only 15 minutes prior to infection followed by washing out of the compound resulted in significant inhibition of entry and virus production. These results suggest that further investigation of prohibitin ligands as potential Chikungunya virus entry inhibitors is warranted.","publish_time":"2015-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wintachai, Phitchayapak; Thuaud, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Basmadjian, Christine; Roytrakul, Sittiruk; Ubol, Sukathida; D\u00E9saubry, Laurent; Smith, Duncan R.","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a314f39d7fc0e33aa005e21995f8165aa0ef4c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168458.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25643977/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Indian Ocean"],"keyphrases":["mammalian cells","CHIKV infection of mammalian Hek293T","reduced virus production","Pretreatment of cells","potential Chikungunya virus entry inhibitors","investigation of prohibitin ligands","plant compounds","flavaglines FL3","significant inhibition of entry","synthetic sulfonyl amidines","potent anti\u2010cancer","cytoprotective","use","FLs","therapeutic treatment","neuroprotective activities","countries","alphavirus","class","FL23","prophylactic agent","large epidemics","specific drug","re\u2010emerging mosquito","receptor protein","islands","minutes","available vaccine","Indian Ocean","results","study"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and seasonality of RSV, influenza, and other respiratory pathogens among children in Qatar. METHODS: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data of 33,404 children (\u003C15 years) presented with influenza-like illness from 2012 to 2017. RESULTS: At least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 26,138 (78%) of patients. Together, human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza viruses comprised nearly two-thirds of all cases, affecting 24%, 19.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. A prevalence of 5-10% was recorded for adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human bocavirus (HboV), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enteroviruses, M. pneumonia, and parechovirus had prevalences below 5%. While RSV, influenza, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal activity in the winter, HRV was active during low RSV and influenza circulation. The burden of RSV exceeds that of influenza among young age groups, whereas influenza correlated positively with age. Further, HRV, adenovirus, influenza, and RSV infection rates varied significantly between male and females. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive multi-year study provides insights into the etiology of ILI among children in Qatar, which represents the Gulf region. Our results reinforce the significance of active surveillance of respiratory pathogens to improve infection prevention and control strategies, particularly among children.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Romaihi, Hamad E.; Smatti, Maria K.; Al-Khatib, Hebah A.; Coyle, Peter V.; Ganesan, Nandakumar; Nadeem, Shazia; Farag, Elmoubasher A.; Al Thani, Asmaa A.; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Ansari, Khalid M.; Al Maslamani, Muna A.; Yassine, Hadi M.","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4f3bbc81ab3801b691395d8f1cf8b72091f8367.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194828.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302241; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278934/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","HMPV"],"locations":["Qatar","Gulf"],"keyphrases":["children","influenza circulation","low RSV","seasonality of RSV","burden of RSV","RSV infection rates","HRV","Qatar","etiology of respiratory infections","human bocavirus","human rhinoviruses","human coronaviruses","Human metapneumovirus","respiratory syncytial virus","significance of active surveillance of respiratory pathogens","HMPV","adenovirus","RESULTS","infection prevention","etiology of ILI","parainfluenza viruses","young age groups","insights","winter","PIVs","comprehensive multi-year study","strong seasonal activity","enteroviruses","HboV","control strategies","CONCLUSION","pneumonia","Studies","surrounding countries","parechovirus","thirds","prevalences","females","BACKGROUND","Gulf region","HCoVs","years","cases","OBJECTIVES","data","illness","METHODS","patients"],"language":"en"},

Each year 25\u201334 calves were sampled weekly from 3 days to one month of age in order to characterize oocyst output, Cryptosporidium species and clinical features associated with infection. Faecal samples were screened for the presence of oocysts using immunofluorescence analysis. DNA was extracted from positive samples and a PCR SSU rRNA followed by RFLP or sequencing was performed. For the subtyping of C. parvum, a gp60 PCR was carried out. Regardless of the year, 92\u2013100% of the animals excreted oocysts on at least one sampling date. Depending on the year of observation, the age of highest prevalence varied. In contrast, the peak of excretion was systematically observed almost at the same age (2nd\u20133rd week of life) with excretion levels ranging from between 100 and 1.7\u00D7107 oocysts/g of faeces. Differences concerning clinical signs depending on the year of sampling were observed. Different species patterns were observed, with a predominance of C. bovis in the 1st year and a predominance of C. parvum in the last year. Moreover, two zoonotic subtypes of C. parvum, IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA18G2R1, were recorded in different years. This study shows that, in a given farm, the Cryptosporidium species and C. parvum subtypes identified as well as the prevalence of infection and level of excretion may vary greatly and show distinct patterns according to the year.","publish_time":"2014-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rieux, Ana\u00EFs; Paraud, Carine; Pors, Isabelle; Chartier, Christophe","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6801a1db7db0ead9748768e3ae28f544562bca70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116914.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685023/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401714001514; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.03.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401714001514","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["year of sampling","year of observation","Cryptosporidium species","Cryptosporidium infection","parvum subtypes","prevalence of infection","Different species patterns","age of highest prevalence","presence of oocysts","month of age","excretion levels","level of excretion","peak of excretion","different years","predominance of","clinical features","clinical signs","positive samples","gp60 PCR","zoonotic subtypes of","Faecal samples","successive years","distinct patterns","sampling date","PCR SSU rRNA","Abstract Cohorts of pre-weaned calves","oocyst output","order","beef cattle herd","western France","RFLP","IIaA15G2R1","IIaA18G2R1","week of life","given farm","sequencing","immunofluorescence analysis","days","DNA","Differences","g of faeces","contrast","subtyping of","animals","bovis","study"],"language":"en"},

These factors included the types of hospital and clinic, reimbursement payment by National Health Insurance, total number of beds, bed occupancy, number of infectious disease beds and outpatients per day. The average waste generation rates ranged from 2.41 to 3.26 kg/bed/day for general medical wastes, and 0.19\u20130.88 kg/bed/day for infectious wastes. The total average quantity of infectious wastes generated was the highest from medical centers, or 3.8 times higher than that from regional hospitals (267.8 vs. 70.3 Tons/yr). The multivariate regression analysis was able to explain 92% of infectious wastes and 64% of general medical wastes, with the amount of insurance reimbursement and number of beds as significant prediction factors.

It was recently introduced, for the first time, into North America and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within Europe as well. To assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infection, multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against PEDV in an inter-laboratory ring trial. Different laboratories have used a variety of \u201Cin house\u201D ELISAs and also one commercial assay. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a Bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard. Although different characteristics were found, it can be concluded that each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early European strains of PEDV or the recently circulating strains (INDEL and non-INDEL). However, not all the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country. The results from individual animals, especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation, show more variation.","publish_time":"2016-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strandbygaard, Bertel; Lavazza, Antonio; Lelli, Davide; Blanchard, Yannick; Grasland, B\u00E9atrice; Poder, Sophie Le; Rose, Nicolas; Steinbach, Falko; van der Poel, Wim H.M.; Wid\u00E9n, Frederik; Belsham, Graham J.; B\u00F8tner, Anette","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117164.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516303339; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516303339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938678/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.11.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["North America","Europe"],"keyphrases":["different assays","detection of PEDV infection","early European strains of PEDV","infection of pigs","ring trial results","multiple countries","Different laboratories","different characteristics","properties of various diagnostic assays","multiple panels of porcine sera","inter-laboratory ring trial","non-INDEL","commercial assay","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","herd level","outbreaks","extensive economic losses","ELISAs","producers","variety","freedom","Bayesian analysis","absence","disease","time","North America","house","experimental situation","presence of antibodies","individual animals","gold standard","variation","country","sensitivity","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Since then, there have been 458 confirmed infection cases and 177 deaths. The virus contains several human-adapted markers, indicating that H7N9 has pandemic potential. The outbreak of this new influenza virus highlighted the need for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Previously, we demonstrated that a tetrameric peptide vaccine based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) of the H5N1 virus (H5N1-M2e) could protect mice from lethal infection with different clades of H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. In this study, we investigated the cross-protection of H5N1-M2e against lethal infection with the new H7N9 virus. Although five amino acid differences existed at positions 13, 14, 18, 20, and 21 between M2e of H5N1 and H7N9, H5N1-M2e vaccination with either Freund\u0027s adjuvant or the Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) induced a high level of anti-M2e antibody, which cross-reacted with H7N9-M2e peptide. A mouse-adapted H7N9 strain, A/Anhui/01/2013m, was used for lethal challenge in animal experiments. H5N1-M2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of the H7N9 virus. Reduced viral replication and histopathological damage of mouse lungs were also observed in the vaccinated mice. Our results suggest that the tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide vaccine could protect against different subtypes of influenza virus infections. Therefore, this vaccine may be an ideal candidate for developing a universal vaccine to prevent the reemergence of avian influenza A H7N9 virus and the emergence of potential novel reassortants of influenza virus.","publish_time":"2015-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Ho-Chuen; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Zhao, Han-Jun; Cheung, Chung-Yan; Ng, Fai; Huang, Jian-Dong; Zheng, Bo-Jian","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/611a37c75e97cd0e251685d63fbbb42dbe3827b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4417706.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2015.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Freund"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["M2e of H5N1","H5N1 virus","H7N9-M2e peptide","H5N1-M2e vaccination","new H7N9 virus","new influenza virus","tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide vaccine","different subtypes of influenza virus infections","different clades of H5N1","novel avian influenza","emergence of potential novel reassortants of influenza virus","lethal infection","reemergence of avian influenza","mouse-adapted H7N9 strain","lethal challenge","universal vaccine","tetrameric peptide vaccine","pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses","development of universal influenza vaccines","high level of anti-M2e antibody","potent cross-protection","pandemic potential","confirmed infection cases","Freund\u0027s adjuvant","vaccinated mice","Sigma adjuvant system","human-adapted markers","histopathological damage of mouse lungs","need","matrix protein","SAS","viral replication","ideal candidate","ectodomain","amino acid differences","positions","deaths","animal experiments","Anhui","patient","outbreak","results","China","study"],"language":"en"},

Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) with replacement of the S gene or 5a with corresponding regions from aYN were rescued to verify this speculation. Embryo mortality time/rate showed that rYN-S-aYN and rYN-5a-aYN had an attenuated phenotype in ovo. Replication assay in ovo and in vitro demonstrated the rIBVs had similar replication patterns with wild-type rIBV. Both rIBVs showed reduced mortality, tissue lesions and tissue virus titers in chicken. In conclusion, S gene and 5a accessory gene are responsible for the attenuation of virulent IBV.

However, a better knowledge of molecular mechanisms contributing to liver damage is required, and it is unknown whether the RHDV induces liver autophagy and how it relates to apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to explore which signalling pathways were involved in the autophagic response induced by the RHDV and to characterize their role in the context of RHDV pathogenesis. Rabbits were infected with 2 \u00D7 10(4) hemmaglutination units of a RHDV isolate. The autophagic response was measured as presence of autophagic vesicles, LC3 staining, conversion of LC3-I to autophagosome-associated LC3-II and changes in expression of beclin-1, UVRAG, Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and p62/SQSTM1. RHDV-triggered autophagy reached a maximum at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and declined at 30 and 36 hpi. Phosphorylation of mTOR also augmented in early periods of infection and there was an increase in the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones BiP/GRP78, CHOP and GRP94. Apoptosis, measured as caspase-3 activity and expression of PARP-1, increased significantly at 30 and 36 hpi in parallel to the maximal expression of the RHDV capsid protein VP60. These data indicate that RHDV infection initiates a rapid autophagic response, perhaps in an attempt to protect liver, which associates to ER stress development and is independent from downregulation of the major autophagy suppressor mTOR. As the infection continues and the autophagic response declines, cells begin to exhibit apoptosis.","publish_time":"2014-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vallejo, Daniela; Crespo, Irene; San-Miguel, Beatriz; \u00C1lvarez, Marcelino; Prieto, Jes\u00FAs; Tu\u00F1\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa Jes\u00FAs; Gonz\u00E1lez-Gallego, Javier","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c995ac4ae70bbcc5da53211e20df4398d1ce55d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3922607.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490870/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-45-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus","RHDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RHDV infection","RHDV isolate","RHDV-triggered autophagy","autophagic response declines","rapid autophagic response","context of RHDV pathogenesis","liver autophagy","hpi","apoptosis","RHDV capsid protein VP60","maximal expression","expression of beclin","expression of PARP","presence of autophagic vesicles","conversion of LC3","LC3 staining","hours post-infection","early periods of infection","liver damage","major autophagy suppressor mTOR","autophagosome-associated LC3","severe disease","Phosphorylation of mTOR","Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus","downregulation","endoplasmic reticulum chaperones BiP","GRP78","maximum","Atg12","Atg16L1","Atg5","CHOP","requirements","UVRAG","animal model of fulminant hepatic failure","ER stress development","better knowledge of molecular mechanisms","p62","changes","role","cells","SQSTM1","GRP94","activity","hemmaglutination units","caspase","increase","attempt","pathways","data","study","Rabbits"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, interactions of MERS-CoV at the human\u2013animal interface may have been ongoing for several, perhaps many, years and by inference, a widespread pandemic may be less likely unless significant evolution of the virus allow accelerated infection and spread potential in the human population.","publish_time":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexandersen, S; Kobinger, G P; Soule, G; Wernery, U","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f23a8772f471052f70a35fe6921865c014cad71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4282458.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456414/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12212","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Canada","Middle East","Dubai"],"keyphrases":["dromedary camels","negative Dubai camels","dromedary samples","dromedary calves","interactions of MERS","sheep","Canada","horses","USA","MERS-CoV recombinant partial spike protein antibody ELISA","accelerated infection","related virus","serial sera","similar results","human population","sequential serum samples","standard Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","spread potential","neutralization test","import testing","new occurrence","low starting dilution","significant evolution","antibodies","export","recent findings","widespread pandemic","animal interface","inference","years","tests","months"],"language":"en"},

Such an approach relies upon an accurate diagnosis of an exacerbation, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. Determining the severity of an exacerbation follows this. If antibiotics are indicated, then a risk stratification approach is described to choose an appropriate antibiotic. An increase in airway inflammation from the baseline level in a patient appears central to the pathogenesis of most acute exacerbations. Airway inflammation measured in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased inflammation accompanies exacerbations and resolves with treatment. Potential pathogens in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations include typical respiratory bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses, and atypical bacteria. The current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors. Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation. The traditional aims of treatment of an exacerbation are improvement in clinical status and the prevention of complications. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of COPD exacerbations has been a matter of controversy. Even more contentious has been the issue whether antibiotic choice is relevant to clinical outcome of exacerbations. Recommendations for antibiotic use among published guidelines are inconsistent.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sethi, Sanjay","journal":"Asthma and COPD","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c9a6e7bab53eaf319bef1749c36ab5d182f205c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150331.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123740014000535; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123740014000535","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibiotic treatment of exacerbations","treatment of COPD exacerbations","acute exacerbations","clinical outcome of exacerbations","antibiotic use","antibiotic choice","appropriate antibiotic","airway inflammation","current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis","typical respiratory bacterial pathogens","Potential pathogens","host","optimal approach","increased inflammation","patient","traditional aims of treatment","risk stratification approach","respiratory viruses","clinical status","role of antibiotics","expectorated sputum","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","bronchial biopsy","bronchoalveolar lavage","baseline level","published guidelines","chapter","improvement","environment","judicious application of diagnostic tests","issue","Recommendations","primary event","Publisher Summary","prevention of complications","atypical bacteria","pathogen factors","Acquisition of strains","accurate diagnosis","limitations","matter of controversy","severity"],"language":"en"},

First, in contrast to the new policy design thinking, disproportionate policy options may be systematically designed, and at times, successfully implemented. Second, in contrast to the new policy design thinking, there are certain conditions under which policymakers may tend to develop effective response, with cost considerations becoming only secondary in importance if at all (read, policy overreaction), or cost-conscious response, with effectiveness considerations becoming only secondary in importance if at all (read, policy underreaction). Third, in contrast to the new policy design thinking, disproportionate policy options may be designed for purposes other than implementation (e.g., to be used as signaling devices or as context-setters). Fourth, in contrast to new policy design thinking, there are certain conditions under which the emotional arena of policy may be equally, if not more, important than the substantive one.

How to activate host immunity against specific TAAs and to suppress tumor growth therefore becomes important in cancer therapy development. RESULTS: To enhance the immune efficiency of CEA in mice that received, we fused a partial CEA gene with exogenous SARS-CoV fragments. Oral vaccination of an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain transformed with plasmids encoding CEA-SARS-CoV fusion gene into BALB/c mice elicited significant increases in TNF-\u03B1 and IL-10 in the serum. In addition, a smaller tumor volume was observed in CT26/CEA-bearing mice who received CEA-SARS-CoV gene therapy in comparison with those administered CEA alone.

Targeted enrichment improves coverage of highly mutable viruses at low concentration in complex samples. Degenerate primers that anneal to conserved regions can facilitate amplification of divergent, low concentration variants, even when the strain present is unknown. Results. A tool for designing multiplex sets of degenerate sequencing primers to tile overlapping amplicons across multiple whole genomes is described. The new script, run_tiled_primers, is part of the PriMux software. Primers were designed for each segment of South American hemorrhagic fever viruses, tick-borne encephalitis, Henipaviruses, Arenaviruses, Filoviruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Each group is highly diverse with as little as 5% genome consensus. Primer sets were computationally checked for nontarget cross reactions against the NCBI nucleotide sequence database. Primers for murine hepatitis virus were demonstrated in the lab to specifically amplify selected genes from a laboratory cultured strain that had undergone extensive passage in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions. This software should help researchers design multiplex sets of primers for targeted whole genome enrichment prior to sequencing to obtain better coverage of low titer, divergent viruses.

We utilized selected nsp2 deletion mutants to examine in vivo growth. Young swine (4 pigs/group; 5 control swine) were inoculated intramuscularly with one of 4 nsp2 deletion mutants (r\u0394727\u2013813, r\u0394543\u2013726, r\u0394324\u2013523, r\u0394324\u2013726) or full-length recombinant virus (rVR-2332). Serum samples were collected on various days post-inoculation and analyzed by HerdChek* ELISA, PRRSV real time RT-PCR, gamma interferon (IFN-\u03B3) ELISA, and nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire nsp2 coding region. Tracheobronchial lymph node weight compared to body weight was recorded for each animal and used as a clinical measurement of viral pathogenesis. Results showed that all deletion mutants grew less robustly than full-length recombinant virus, yet all but the large deletion virus (r\u0394324\u2013726) recovered to parental viral RNA levels by study end. Swine receiving the r\u0394727\u2013813 mutants had a significant decrease in lymph node enlargement compared to rVR-2332. While swine infection with rVR-2332 caused a rapid rise in serum IFN-\u03B3 levels, the IFN-\u03B3 protein produced by infection with 3 of the 4 deletion mutant viruses was significantly reduced, perhaps due to differences in viral growth kinetics. The r\u0394543\u2013726 nsp2 mutant virus, although growth impaired, mimicked rVR-2332 in inducing a host serum IFN-\u03B3 response but exhibited a 2-week delay. Targeted sequencing showed that all deletions were stable in the region coding for nsp2 after one swine passage. The data suggested that the selected nsp2 deletion mutants were growth attenuated in swine, altered the induction of serum IFN-\u03B3, an innate cytokine of unknown function in PRRSV clearance, and pointed to a domain that may influence tracheobronchial lymph node size.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faaberg, Kay S.; Kehrli, Marcus E.; Lager, Kelly M.; Guo, Baoqing; Han, Jun","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3be6ec929105fe9945eaf5804c0135078a70a2f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114397.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210002650; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210002650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20673840/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.07.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selected nsp2 deletion mutants","nsp2 mutant virus","IFN-\u03B3 protein","serum IFN-\u03B3 levels","large deletion virus","swine infection","induction of serum IFN-\u03B3","Young swine","control swine","swine passage","entire nsp2 coding region","host serum IFN-\u03B3 response","full-length recombinant virus","virus viability","deletion mutant viruses","r\u0394324","viral growth kinetics","Tracheobronchial lymph node weight","region coding","growth impaired","Serum samples","mimicked rVR","lymph node enlargement","tracheobronchial lymph node size","ELISA","PRRSV clearance","hypervariable region","r\u0394727","r\u0394543","parental viral RNA levels","PRRSV strain VR","body weight","non-structural protein","clinical measurement of viral pathogenesis","PRRSV real time RT-PCR","HerdChek","gamma interferon","nucleotide sequence analysis","innate cytokine of unknown function","significant decrease","various days post-inoculation","rapid rise","Abstract Prior studies","deletions","study end","pigs","group","animal","domain","differences","data","Targeted sequencing","Results","amino acids","week delay"],"language":"en"},

IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3\u2019 UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins. However, the overall composition of their ribonucleoprotein complexes appears distinct, leading to differences in the breadth of nucleases restricted.

Unfortunately, neonatal losses tend to be much higher in nondomestic calves before weaning than in domestic cattle, sheep, and goat herds.1 With continued habitat and population declines in wild species, successful captive breeding of nondomestic herds becomes more important to species sustainability and potential reintroduction programs. The primary challenges contributing to neonatal losses in nondomestic ruminants are often animal temperament and adaptation to captivity.

Despite the importance of cattle farming in Austria, little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of bovine Eimeria spp. The objective of this study was to obtain detailed information about the occurrence of different Eimeria spp. on Austrian dairy farms. Fecal samples from individual calves (n = 868) from 296 farms all over Austria (82 districts) were collected. Additionally, each farmer was questioned about the occurrence of calf diarrhea, and about the knowledge on coccidiosis and possible control measures. On 97.97% of the investigated farms, calves excreted Eimeria oocysts, and 83.67% of the individual samples were positive. After sporulation of positive samples pooled from each farm, 11 Eimeria species were found, with E. bovis (in 65.54% of the samples and 27.74% of the farms), E.zuernii (63.85%/13.86%), E. auburnensis (56.76%/13.41%) and E. ellipsoidalis (54.05%/14.38%) being the most prevalent, followed by E. alabamensis (45.61%/11.56%), E. subspherica (35.14%/5.5.05%), E. cylindrica (33.11%/7.00%), and E. canadensis (31.08%/7.74%). E. wyomingensis, E. pellita and E. bukidnonensis were only found sporadically (3.04\u20134.73% of the samples and 0.16\u20130.59% of the farms). Mixed infections were present on all farms (2\u20139 Eimeria species/farm). Prevalences by state provinces were high throughout with 77.1\u201387.9% of the samples and 93.8\u2013100% of the farms. Lower Austria had the highest percentage of positive farms, and Vorarlberg the lowest. Individual OPG (oocysts per gram of feces) values were generally low; 75% of the samples had an OPG of 1,000 or less. The highest detected OPG was 72,400. The mean OPG was 2,525 with above average numbers in Tirol, Carinthia, and Lower Austria. The mean OPG values were significantly positively correlated with the cattle density in the different districts. The majority of the samples were from female Simmenthal calves. Clinical coccidiosis (diarrhea) was observed in 74 cases, and (semi-)liquid diarrhea (56 animals) was significantly correlated with OPG (p \u003C 0.05). Linear regression on the OPG data showed that OPG values significantly decreased with increasing age of the calves, while the percentage of positive samples increased with age (p \u003C 0.05 for both). The term \u201Ccoccidia\u201D was familiar to 45% of the farmers, and anticoccidial treatment was performed by 13.51% of them, most commonly with toltrazuril. Considering the ubiquitous occurrence and the possible clinical and economic relevance of calf eimeriosis, infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians.","publish_time":"2011-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koutny, H.; Joachim, A.; Tichy, A.; Baumgartner, W.","journal":"Parasitol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01adbe8224d7723f2d5255c40e2e891def30039e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087621.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2715-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22167365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. auburnensis","E. ellipsoidalis","E. alabamensis"],"organizations":["Individual OPG","OPG"],"locations":["Austria"],"keyphrases":["individual samples","Individual OPG","percentage of positive samples","Fecal samples","sporulation of positive samples","OPG data","investigated farms","mean OPG values","highest percentage of positive farms","highest detected OPG","Eimeria oocysts","Eimeria species","individual calves","occurrence of different Eimeria","Austrian dairy farms","Lower Austria","occurrence of calf diarrhea","distribution of bovine Eimeria","ubiquitous occurrence","Clinical coccidiosis","different districts","female Simmenthal calves","Bovine eimeriosis","liquid diarrhea","farmers","health of cattle","importance of cattle farming","cattle density","economic relevance of calf eimeriosis","Mixed infections","increasing age","increased attention","considerable importance","possible control measures","knowledge","Tirol","Carinthia","gram of feces","average numbers","detailed information","study","productivity","abundance","objective","animals","Vorarlberg","Prevalences","state provinces","cases","veterinarians","Linear regression","wyomingensis","pellita","bukidnonensis","term","country","anticoccidial treatment","zuernii","majority","alabamensis","bovis","auburnensis","ellipsoidalis","subspherica","cylindrica","canadensis","toltrazuril"],"language":"en"},

Although Japan was spared from the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hospitals were placed on high alert. The actual preparedness level of hospitals can be determined by examining individual perceptions among the hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). The objective of this study was to assess the level of preparedness of emergency infection control measures in Japan and to quantify the differences in preparedness across institutions and disciplines. From July to September 2003, a questionnaire survey concerning the perceptions of risks and countermeasures and knowledge about SARS was distributed at seven tertiary hospitals. Disciplines were categorized as emergency room (ER)/intensive care unit (ICU), surgical, medical, and \u201Cothers\u201D. Of the 9978 questionnaires administered, 6929 valid responses were received and analyzed. After adjusting for age, sex, and job category, specific institutional measures (I-scores) were found to be more indicative of the level of preparedness across institutions and disciplines than were measures of overall effectiveness (E-scores) or knowledge of preventive measures (K-scores). In particular, the difference in I-scores was much more substantial across institutions than across disciplines. Across disciplines, surgical ranked lower than ER/ICU or medical. In conclusion, substantial differences in emergency infection control measures, as perceived by HCWs, exists among hospitals in Japan, with the differences across institutions exceeding those across disciplines. To achieve a higher level of preparedness for infectious diseases, institutions should designate and implement effective emergency infection control measures.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imai, Teppei; Takahashi, Ken; Hoshuyama, Tsutomu; Hasegawa, Naoki; Chia, Sin Eng; Koh, David","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c0e34bf4f90c76993a32895fb0eb335dde787a4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d5208bb9663eaf31ec26f29e656dbe944b71fbf6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X06709357; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X06709357","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ER/ICU"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["disciplines","institutions","Abstract Emergency infection control measures","effective emergency infection control measures","actual preparedness level of hospitals","knowledge of preventive measures","higher level of preparedness","emergency room","specific institutional measures","tertiary hospitals","Japan","substantial differences","E-scores","ICU","SARS","HCWs","perceptions of risks","individual perceptions","job category","intensive care unit","epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome","hospital healthcare workers","infectious diseases","sex","countermeasures","overall effectiveness","conclusion","age","questionnaire survey","questionnaires","valid responses","study","high alert","objective"],"language":"en"},

Examples include established viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of respiratory infection in infants and young children, and emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which reached near pandemic levels in 2003, or H1N1 (swine) influenza. Despite this prevalence, traditional methods of virus detection are typically labor intensive and require several days to successfully confirm infection. Recently, however, nanoparticle\u2010based detection strategies have been employed in an effort to develop detection assays that are both sensitive and expedient. Each of these platforms capitalizes on the unique properties of nanoparticles for the detection of respiratory viruses. In this article, several nanoparticle\u2010based scaffolds are discussed.Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been functionalized with virus specific antibodies or oligonucleotides. In each of these constructs, AuNPs act as both an easily conjugated scaffolding system for biological molecules and a powerful fluorescence quencher. AuNPs have also been immobilized and used as electrochemical transducers. They efficiently serve as a conducting interface of electrocatalyic activity making them a powerful tool in this application. Quantum dots (QDs) posses unique fluorescence properties that have also been explored for their application to virus detection when combined with direct antibody conjugation or streptavidin\u2010biotin binding systems. QDs have an advantage over many traditional fluorophores because their fluorescence properties can be finely tuned and they are resistant to photobleaching. The development of these nanoparticle\u2010based detection strategies holds the potential to be a powerful method to quickly and easily confirm respiratory virus infection.

Respiratory syncytial virus is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection. Some other virus may be found during co-infections. The aim of this study was to search for biological markers correlated with gravity and risk factors for asthma and allergy. The follow-up was done during the multicenter and prospective study Bronchiolitis (PHRC 2000 No. 2000/020/HP), performed between November 2001 and January 2006, which included seven centers in France: Rouen, Le Havre, Lille, Elbeuf, Evreux, Brest and Saint-Nazaire associated with Nantes. Clinical and biological data were gathered during initial course, then at 1month and 1year. For the population of 209 infants, mean age was 3months, the gravity was evaluated by scoring. The laboratory results correlated with clinical scoring were the following: viral evaluation, absolute numbers of leucocytes, lymphocytes and eosinophils, flow cytometry for sub-populations of lymphocytes, allergology including IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein, and basophil activation test. The results of the study are presented and discussed.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Legru, E.; Lees, O.; Bubenheim, M.; Boyer, O.; Marguet, C.","journal":"Journal de P\u00E9diatrie et de Pu\u00E9riculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6fd4931a5385b1379346dc5db0b1317efa9aee4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146813.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0987798309000796; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0987798309000796","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Elbeuf"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rouen","Le Havre","Lille","Evreux","Brest","Nantes","France"],"keyphrases":["the study","The results","The aim","the population","the gravity was evaluated","was done during the multicenter","The laboratory results correlated with clinical scoring were the following","Respiratory syncytial virus is the major cause","lymphocytes","virus respiratoire syncytial","\u00E9tude de cohorte","prospective study Bronchiolitis","biological markers correlated with gravity","this study was to search","lower respiratory tract infection","mean age was","eosinophilic cationic protein","Brest","infection virale respiratoire \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","Evreux","Saint-Nazaire associated with Nantes","\u00E9l\u00E9ments de gravit\u00E9","Rouen","Havre","Lille","Elbeuf","\u00E9valuation de la gravit\u00E9","PHRC","\u00E9pisode de bronchiolite aigu\u00EB","mois","r\u00E9sultats suivants","r\u00E9sultats de laboratoires","HP","Summary Acute bronchiolitis is an acute respiratory infection which commonly occurs in infancy","Some other virus may be found during co-infections","basophil activation test","co-infections virales","cadre du protocole Bronchiolite","were gathered during initial course","num\u00E9ration des leucocytes","identification virale","asthme du nourrisson","which included seven centers in France","allergology including IgE","flux de populations lymphocytaires","viral evaluation","months","then at","risk factors","January","absolute numbers","eosinophils","sub","flow cytometry","cytom\u00E9trie","\u00E9osinophiles","infants","asthma","allergologie","seuls","agent infectieux","presented","performed between November","moyenne","\u00E9volution","association","hospitalisation initiale","visites suivantes","marqueurs biologiques pr\u00E9dictifs","year","allergy","nourrissons \u00E2g\u00E9s","discussed","crit\u00E8res cliniques","donn\u00E9es clinicobiologiques","travail","but","bronchiolites","centres"],"language":"fr"},

A controlled, randomized, blocked, blind experiment containing 680 lactating pregnant dairy cows with a viable embryo diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography was performed. Two dairy operation sites (farm A and farm B) were selected. At each farm, the cows were randomly divided into control (CON) and ASP groups. The CON group was not subjected to pregnancy diagnosis via per rectum palpation. The ASP examinations were performed by one experienced veterinarian between Days 34 and 45 after breeding. All cows were reevaluated by transrectal ultrasonography only between 2 and 4 weeks later. Two calving rates were calculated: calving rate 1 (cows that calved from the initial number of pregnant cows) and calving rate 2 (cows that calved from cows pregnant at reexamination). In farm A, the percentages of early pregnancy loss were 11.5% (19 of 165) and 13.2% (24 of 182) for the CON and the ASP groups, respectively (P = 0.64). In farm B, the percentage of early pregnancy loss was 11.2% (19 of 170) for the CON group and 8.8% (14 of 159; P = 0.48) for the ASP group. In farm A, the percentage of late pregnancy loss was 7.6% (11 of 145) for the CON group and 5.5% (8 of 155; P = 0.39) for the ASP group. In farm B, the percentage of late pregnancy loss was 3.7% (5 of 137) for the CON group and 6.3% (8 of 127; P = 0.32) for the ASP group. In farm A, early pregnancy loss was higher than late pregnancy loss (12.4% vs. 6.3%; P = 0.01), and in farm B, the same tendency was detected (10.0% vs. 4.9%, for early and late pregnancy loss, respectively; P = 0.02). In farm A, calving rate 1 was 81.2% (134 of 165) for the CON group and 80.8% (147 of 182; P = 0.92) for the ASP group. Calving rate 2 for the same groups was 92.4% (134 of 145) and 94.8% (147 of 155), respectively (P = 0.68). In farm B, calving rate 1 was 77.7% (132 of 170) for the CON group and 74.8% (119 of 159; P = 0.55) for the ASP group. Calving rates 2 for the same groups were 87.4% (132 of 151) and 82.1% (119 of 145), respectively (P = 0.20). Two female calves with atresia coli were diagnosed only in the CON group. It was concluded that ASP during the late embryonic period for pregnancy diagnosis did not increase the pregnancy loss, affect calving rates, or produce abnormalities in calves.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romano, Juan E.; Bryan, Kelsey; Ramos, Roney S.; Velez, Juan; Pinedo, Pablo","journal":"Theriogenology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0735050dc086a548bf9d586ce784fdd4f9fb068f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103115.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.09.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093691X15004756; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X15004756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26443235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASP","CON"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["farm B","pregnancy diagnosis","percentage of late pregnancy loss","percentage of early pregnancy loss","ASP groups","percentages of early pregnancy loss","calving rates","ASP examinations","cows pregnant","late embryonic period","lactating pregnant dairy cows","initial number of pregnant cows","abnormalities","newborn calves","female calves","transrectal ultrasonography","rectum palpation","dairy operation sites","rectal amniotic sac palpation","viable embryo","effect","blind experiment","experienced veterinarian","Days","present study","atresia coli","control","objectives","reexamination","tendency","breeding","weeks"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to compare the mRNA expression of genes associated with Tregs (CD25, FoxP3, CTLA4, and IDO), after experimental infection of beef calves with low (LV) or high (HV) virulence BVDV. Thirty BVDV-na\u00EFve calves were randomly assigned to three groups. Calves were intra-nasally inoculated with LV (n =10, strain SD-1) or HV (n =10, strain 1373) BVDV or BVDV-free cell culture medium (control, n =10). Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of target genes in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes and spleen on day 5 post-infection. The mRNA expression of CD25 was up-regulated in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of LV (P \u003C0.05), but not in HV compared to the control group. The expression of FoxP3 and CTLA4 was not increased in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of either of the BVDV-inoculated groups. A dramatic up-regulation of IDO mRNA was observed in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of LV (P \u003C0.05), but not HV compared to the control calves. In conclusion, experimental infection with BVDV did not provide evidence of Treg activation based on expression of FoxP3 and CTL4. Differential expression of CD25 and IDO mRNA on day 5 post-infection with HV or LV BVDV might reflect temporal differences in transcription occurring during the immune response elicited by these viral strains, or differences in viral infectivity of the host cells.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palomares, Roberto A.; Hurley, David J.; Woolums, Amelia R.; Parrish, Jacqueline E.; Brock, Kenny V.","journal":"Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aef7ab6172a15c65ed6f8b745d5df80978a3955b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112516.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2014.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25456194/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957114000538; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957114000538","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV","LV (P","IDO","LV BVDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LV BVDV","virulence BVDV","HV","BVDV-na\u00EFve calves","expression of FoxP3","mRNA expression of CD25","BVDV-inoculated groups","tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of LV","mRNA expression of genes","control calves","Differential expression of CD25","post-infection","expression of target genes","experimental infection of beef calves","regulation of IDO mRNA","BVDV-free cell culture medium","viral strains","day","viral infectivity","Tregs","CTLA4","control group","bovine viral diarrhea virus","temporal differences","strain SD","spleen","leukopenia","relationship","transcription","regulatory T lymphocytes","impairment of leukocyte function","Abstract Immunosuppression","immune response","evidence of Treg activation","lymphocyte depletion","host cells","work","study","conclusion","Quantitative RT-PCR","CTL4","objective"],"language":"en"},

Mice would be an attractive system for such studies, but ZIKV replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it fails to antagonize murine STAT2 and STING. To address this, most ZIKV pathogenesis studies have used mice with impaired interferon signaling (e.g. Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 or treatment with IFNAR1-blocking antibodies). However, using mice with severe defects in innate antiviral signaling confounds studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms. Collaborative Cross (CC) mice have proven to be a valuable system for developing new mouse pathogenesis models for viral infections that are not well modeled in conventional laboratory mouse lines. To test whether CC mice could provide an immune-competent model for ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected CC lines with ZIKV and assessed weight loss, viremia, and production of neutralizing antibodies. We tested 21 CC lines (CC001, CC002, CC003, CC004, CC005, CC006, CC011, CC012, CC013, CC019, CC024, CC028, CC040, CC041, CC042, CC046, CC051, CC059, CC061, CC068, and CC072, 13 of which have non-functional alleles of the flavivirus restriction factor Oas1b) and 3 ZIKV strains (MR766, H/PF/2013, and a mouse-adapted variant of Dakar 41525). ZIKV infection did not induce weight loss compared to mock-infected controls and accordingly only low levels of viral RNA were detected in serum. Only a subset of mice developed neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV, likely due to overall low levels of infection and viremia. Our results are consistent with other studies demonstrating poor ZIKV infection in interferon-intact mice and suggest that the tested CC lines do not include polymorphic host genes that greatly increase susceptibility to ZIKV infection.","publish_time":"2019-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mattocks, Melissa D.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Fritch, Ethan J.; Baric, Ralph S.; Ferris, Martin T.; Heise, Mark T.; Lazear, Helen M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1604804e454bd1e651a64a6a1eebaebb406babf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/30814fcc87b8f3e5d4f7431d75b9505b049021e0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/695510","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","Collaborative Cross","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV strains","ZIKV replicates","CC mice","ZIKV pathogenesis studies","poor ZIKV infection","laboratory mice","subset of mice","study ZIKV pathogenic mechanisms","interferon-intact mice","tested CC lines","studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms","overall low levels of infection","conventional laboratory mouse lines","new mouse pathogenesis models","weight loss","viremia","low levels of viral RNA","viral infections","production of neutralizing antibodies","Ifnar1","impaired interferon","valuable system","birth defects","severe defects","mouse-adapted variant of Dakar","attractive system","small animal models","mock-infected controls","innate antiviral","CC051","CC046","CC042","CC041","CC040","CC028","CC024","CC019","CC013","CC012","CC011","CC006","CC005","CC004","CC003","need","flavivirus restriction factor Oas1b","CC002","candidate vaccines","polymorphic host genes","CC061","CC059","non-functional alleles","CC001","susceptibility","pregnancy","immune-competent model","Americas","CC068","PF","MR766","recognition","emergence of Zika virus","CC072","antivirals","treatment","Collaborative Cross","murine STAT2","STING","serum","results"],"language":"en"},

However, since pathogen detection chips currently utilize random primers rather than specific primers for the RT-PCR step, bias inherent in random PCR amplification becomes a serious problem that causes large inaccuracies in hybridization signals. RESULTS: In this paper, we study how the efficiency of random PCR amplification affects hybridization signals. We describe a model that predicts the amplification efficiency of a given random primer on a target viral genome. The prediction allows us to filter false-negative probes of the genome that lie in regions of poor random PCR amplification and improves the accuracy of pathogen detection. Subsequently, we propose LOMA, an algorithm to generate random primers that have good amplification efficiency. Wet-lab validation showed that the generated random primers improve the amplification efficiency significantly. CONCLUSION: The blind use of a random primer with attached universal tag (random-tagged primer) in a PCR reaction on a pathogen sample may not lead to a successful amplification. Thus, the design of random-tagged primers is an important consideration when performing PCR.","publish_time":"2008-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Wah Heng; Wong, Christopher W; Leong, Wan Yee; Miller, Lance D; Sung, Wing Kin","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b19a29c5c29055c01ee2e63ec63a395c0f7ddb17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2553803.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18783594/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-368","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficiency of random PCR amplification","design of random","generated random primers","regions of poor random PCR amplification","given random primer","good amplification efficiency","successful amplification","PCR reaction","specific primers","RT-PCR step","accuracy of pathogen detection","pathogen detection chips","pathogen sample","hybridization signals","target viral genome","serious problem","attached universal tag","potential","large inaccuracies","DNA microarrays","blind use","BACKGROUND","Wet-lab validation","comprehensive diagnostics tool","false-negative probes","important consideration","algorithm","CONCLUSION","paper","LOMA","model","RESULTS","prediction"],"language":"en"},

Children eligible for enrollment in this study were aged 24\u201359 months and presented with acute respiratory symptoms and fever. Naso\u2010 and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and multiplex reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010PCR) was performed to identify the respiratory viruses involved. In total, 492 children were included in this study: 248 in 2010 and 244 in 2011. In 2010, 136 samples (55%) were found to be positive for at least one virus and the most frequently detected viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV) (18%), adenovirus (AdV) (13%), and human coronavirus (CoV) (5%). In 2011, 158 samples (65%) were found to be positive for at least one virus, and the most frequently detected were HRV (29%), AdV (12%), and enterovirus (9%). Further, the presence of asthma (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.86\u20135.46) was independently associated with HRV infection, whereas fever was associated with AdV (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.31\u201316.52) and influenza infections (OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.26\u201316.06). Ten patients (2%) were diagnosed with pneumonia, and six of these tested positive for viral infection (4 HRV, 1 RSV, and 1 AdV). Thus, this study identified the most common respiratory viruses found in preschool children in the study region and demonstrated their high frequency, highlighting the need for improved data collection, and case management in order to stimulate preventive measures against these infections.

SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in late December 2019 and, since then, has become a global pandemic. Timely and accurate COVID-19 laboratory testing is an essential step in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak. To date, assays based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory samples are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Unfortunately, RT-PCR has several practical limitations. Consequently, alternative diagnostic methods are urgently required, both for alleviating the pressure on laboratories and healthcare facilities and for expanding testing capacity to enable large-scale screening and ensure a timely therapeutic intervention. To date, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential utilization of rapid testing for COVID-19, with some conflicting results. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on ten studies, we computed a pooled sensitivity of 64.8% (95%CI 54.5-74.0), and specificity of 98.0% (95%CI 95.8-99.0), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias. We can conclude that: (1) rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are necessary, but should be adequately sensitive and specific; (2) few studies have been carried out to date; (3) the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power, and (4) in light of these results, the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests, such as assays based on RT-PCR.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ricc\u00F2, Matteo; Ferraro, Pietro; Gualerzi, Giovanni; Ranzieri, Silvia; Henry, Brandon Michael; Said, Younes Ben; Pyatigorskaya, Natalia Valeryevna; Nevolina, Elena; Wu, Jianhong; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Signorelli, Carlo","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accurate COVID","studies","RT-PCR","date","feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests","laboratory testing","testing capacity","use of available tests","management","potential utilization of rapid testing","reliable molecular tests","assays","outbreak","SARS-CoV","alternative diagnostic methods","low numbers","conflicting results","low sample power","timely therapeutic intervention","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","large-scale screening","respiratory samples","healthcare facilities","gold standard","meta-analysis","essential step","high heterogeneity","risk of reporting bias","present systematic review","clinical purposes","pressure","laboratories","contagious infection","diagnosis","practical limitations","light","pooled sensitivity","global pandemic","specificity"],"language":"en"},

This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75% and 77% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus. HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from HCoV-EMC remains uncertain.

This narrative review attempts to describe some problems with the management of Covid-19 induced acute respiratory failure (ARF) by pulmonologists. Methods We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reviewed the references of retrieved articles for additional studies. The search was limited to the terms: Covid-19 AND: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), SARS, MERS, non invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), pronation (PP), health care workers (HCW). Results Protection of Health care workers should be paramount, so full Personal Protective Equipment and Negative pressure rooms are warranted. HFNC alone or with PP could be offered for mild cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 200-300); NIV alone or with PP may work in moderate cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 100-200). Rotation and coupled (HFNC/NIV) strategy can be beneficial. A window of opportunity of 1-2hours is advised. If PaO2/FIO2 significantly increases, Respiratory Rate decreases with a relatively low Exhaled Tidal Volume, the non-invasive strategy could be working and intubation delayed. Conclusion Although there is a role for non-invasive respiratory therapies in the context of COVID-19 ARF, more research is still needed to define the balance of benefits and risks to patients and HCW. Indirectly, non invasive respiratory therapies may be of particular benefit in reducing the risks to healthcare workers by obviating the need for intubation, a potentially highly infectious procedure.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Winck, Jo\u00E3o Carlos; Ambrosino, Nicolino","journal":"Pulmonology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6370a094816fd942183e9e1525487ddf2451797.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531043720300933?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531043720300933; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.04.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rotation"],"organizations":["Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","HFNC","NIV","HCW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-invasive respiratory therapies","NIV","HFNC","FiO2","PaO2","context of COVID","management of Covid","Respiratory Rate decreases","induced acute respiratory failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","non-invasive strategy","healthcare workers","risks","ARF","intubation","HCW","Results Protection of Health care workers","invasive ventilation","mild cases","moderate cases","EMBASE","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","low Exhaled Tidal Volume","high flow nasal cannula","Personal Protective Equipment","MEDLINE","SARS","ARDS","pronation","references of retrieved articles","Negative pressure rooms","problems","MERS","particular benefit","following databases","additional studies","patients","role","balance of benefits","narrative review attempts","war","need","pulmonologists","Abstract Background","Methods","infectious procedure","terms","research","Rotation","window of opportunity","hours","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique innate immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized. Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFN\u03B1 in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL that plays a role in controlling viral infection. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie unique virus-host relationship in bats. Bats are considered unique in their ability to resist disease caused by viruses that are often pathogenic in humans. While the nature of this viral resistance is unknown, genomic data suggest bat innate immune systems may be specialized in controlling these disease-causing viruses. A critical cell intrinsic antiviral defense system in vertebrates is the interferon response, which suppresses viral infection through induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we report the repertoire of ISGs and several unique features of ISG induction kinetics in bat cells. We also characterize induction and antiviral activity of bat RNASEL, which is induced by IFN in bat, but not human cells. These studies lay the foundation for discovery of potentially new antiviral mechanisms in bats, which may spur research into development of therapies to combat viral infection.","publish_time":"2017-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"De La Cruz-Rivera, Pamela C.; Kanchwala, Mohammed; Liang, Hanquan; Kumar, Ashwani; Wang, Lin-Fa; Xing, Chao; Schoggins, John W.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5375b6cc7be1c8ba8f09a003f305a6c4ded24eb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5d9e490190986584d799e2828c6fd9679e5ae159.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/167999","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat cells","viral infection","Bats","alecto ISGs","human ISGs","canonical ISGs","interferon response","repertoire of ISGs","viral resistance","antiviral activity of bat RNASEL","bat Pteropus alecto","unique innate immune system","unique features of ISG induction kinetics","small group of non-canonical bat ISGs","innate immune response","induction of hundreds","human cells","studies","intact IFN system","important viral reservoir","IFN treatment","transcriptional response","unique temporal subclusters","interferon-stimulated genes","new antiviral mechanisms","similar early induction kinetics","unique virus-host relationship","foundation","immune systems","gene regulatory mechanisms","pathogenic zoonotic viruses","disease-causing viruses","critical cell intrinsic antiviral defense system","global ISG expression patterns","Kinetic gene profiling","conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity","immunological features","active RNASEL","host-based differences","vertebrates","genomic data","longer periods","distinct late-phase declines","cellular defenses","black flying fox","number","discovery","development of therapies","role","ability","IFN\u03B1","insight","contrast","research","reservoirs","nature","RNA-Seq","humans","transcripts","species","study"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Background and objectives: Spain is in a situation of indefinite lockdown due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. One of the consequences of this lockdown is delays in medical and surgical procedures for common diseases. The aim of this study was to model the impact on survival of tumor growth caused by such delays in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. Material and methods: Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. We constructed an exponential growth model for both SCC and melanoma to estimate tumor growth between patient-reported onset and surgical excision at different time points. Results: Data from 200 patients with SCC of the head and neck and 1000 patients with cutaneous melanoma were included. An exponential growth curve was calculated for each tumor type and we estimated tumor size after 1, 2, and 3 months of potential surgical delay. The proportion of patients with T3 SCC (diameter \u003E 4 cm or thickness \u003E 6 mm) increased from 41.5% (83 patients) in the initial study group to an estimated 58.5%, 70.5%, and 72% after 1, 2, and 3 months of delay. Disease-specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in patients whose surgery was delayed by 3 months decreased by 6.2%, 8.2%, and 5.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients with ultrathick melanoma (\u003E 6 mm) increased from 6.9% in the initial study group to 21.9%, 30.2%, and 30.2% at 1, 2, and 3 months. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survival both decreased by 14.4% in patients treated after a potential delay of 3 months. Conclusions: In the absence of adequate diagnosis and treatment of SCC and melanoma in the current lockdown situation in Spain, we can expect to see to a considerable increase in large and thick SCCs and melanomas. Efforts must be taken to encourage self-examination and facilitate access to dermatologists in order to prevent further delays.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tejera-Vaquerizo, A.; Ca\u00F1ueto, J.; Toll, A.; Santos-Juanes, J.; Jaka, A.; Ferrandiz, C.; Sanmart\u00EDn, O.; Ribero, S.; Moreno-Ram\u00EDrez, D.; Almaz\u00E1n, F.; Fuente, M.

Here we show its antiviral efficacy against noroviruses. \u03B3-PGA with a molecular mass of 2,000-kDa limited murine norovirus (MNV) replication in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 by inducing interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 and conferred resistance to viral infection-induced cell death. Additionally, \u03B3-PGA interfered with viral entry into cells. The potent antiviral state mounted by \u03B3-PGA was not attributed to the upregulation of TLR4 or TLR3, a sensor known to recognize norovirus RNA. \u03B3-PGA sensing by TLR4 required the two TLR4-associated accessory factors MD2 and CD14. In ex vivo cultures of mouse ileum, \u03B3-PGA selectively increased the expression of IFN-\u03B2 in villi. In contrast, IFN-\u03B2 induction was negligible in the ileal Peyer\u2019s patches (PPs) where its expression was primarily induced by the replication of MNV. Oral administration of \u03B3-PGA, which increased serum IFN-\u03B2 levels without inducing proinflammatory cytokines, reduced MNV loads in the ileum with PPs and mesenteric lymph nodes in mice.

The living circumstances and activities of the pilgrims may create an environment for the occurrence and spread of communicable diseases. Each year, the Health authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in coordination with international health authorities, updates health requirements for pilgrims. The Hajj for 2017 took place from August 24 to September 5, 2017. Here, we review the expected obligations for immunizations for the 2018 Hajj and Umrah. Results The Hajj and Umrah vaccine requirements include mandatory vaccinations against yellow fever, quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide (every 3 years) or conjugated (every 5 years) vaccines and poliomyelitis vaccine. Influenza vaccine utilizing the 2016 (Southern Hemisphere vaccine to all pilgrims) was recommended but was not obligatory for pilgrims. Ciprofloxacin is required for individuals \u003E12 years excluding pregnant women as chemoprophylaxis to be given at the port of entry for Pilgrims coming from the meningitis belt. With the ongoing outbreaks of measles in Europe, it is recommended that all pilgrims have an updated immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles and mumps). Conclusion The mandatory vaccines remain the same with continued vigilance for the development of any new or emerging infectious diseases. Continuing surveillance for Zika virus, cholera and MERS-CoV are ongoing.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Gautret, Philippe; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/740b4f4a7e5b97edb6eb5d1c52f9f302f8dc9619.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110709.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2017.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893917301606; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893917301606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Southern Hemisphere","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Umrah vaccine requirements","vaccine-preventable diseases","globe drawing pilgrims","poliomyelitis vaccine","Influenza vaccine","years","annual Hajj","Southern Hemisphere vaccine","updates health requirements","Health authority","mandatory vaccines","communicable diseases","international health authorities","emerging infectious diseases","ongoing outbreaks of measles","mandatory vaccinations","yellow fever","cholera","coordination","largest recurring religious mass gatherings","quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide","pertussis","tetanus","diphtheria","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Zika virus","development","updated immunization","MERS-CoV","Continuing surveillance","individuals","chemoprophylaxis","pregnant women","continued vigilance","immunizations","Abstract Background","mumps","occurrence","Europe","living circumstances","activities","port of entry","expected obligations","meningitis belt","Conclusion","environment","countries","Ciprofloxacin","place"],"language":"en"},

Summary Introduction In November 2002 an epidemic of atypical pneumonia appeared in the Chinese region of Guandong. It was subsequently given the name \u201CSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201D (SARS) following the occurrence of further outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong in February 2003. Five cases related to the same patient source have been reported in France. Case report We report the case of a patient of 52 years who had direct contact with a probable case of SARS. On admission the patient presented with pyrexia associated with lymphopenia and liver cell necrosis but no respiratory symptoms. The chest x-ray was normal. The thoracic CT scan showed a sub pleural ground glass appearance. Early (36 hours) PCR studies of naso-pharyngeal washings were negative for the coronavirus associated with SARS. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically. Conclusions This observation demonstrates the existence of incomplete clinical presentations of SARS. The infectivity of this asymptomatic form is unknown. Serological analyses will allow better identification. The continuing danger of seasonal recurrence, particularly in the winter, cannot be ignored. In this context the recognition of probably infectious asymptomatic forms is essential.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andr\u00E9, M.; Talarmin, F.; Le Guen, P.; Nicolas, X.; Garcia, J.-F.; Natali, F.","journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbcb9fbf6f8a0ba39955428a6a0c497e096bd4e2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842505854440; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842505854440","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Guangdong","Hanoi","Hong Kong","France","Guandong"],"keyphrases":["The infectivity","The thoracic","particularly in the winter","The continuing danger","following the occurrence","the coronavirus associated with SARS","In this context the recognition","Conclusions This observation demonstrates the existence","Case report We report the case","The diagnosis was confirmed serologically","admission the patient presented with pyrexia associated with lymphopenia","atypical pneumonia appeared in the Chinese region","It was subsequently given the name","The chest x-ray was normal","Five cases related to the same patient source","reported in France","Hong Kong in February","further outbreaks in Hanoi","Summary Introduction In November","probable case","cas probable","nom de syndrome respiratoire aigu s\u00E9v\u00E8re","existence de pr\u00E9sentations cliniques","SRAS","cas reli\u00E9s","confirmation du cas","contagiosit\u00E9 des formes","years who had direct contact with","this asymptomatic form is unknown","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","ans contact direct","symptomatologie respiratoire associ\u00E9e","PCR studies","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction","danger actuel","reconnaissance des formes","radiographie thoracique","\u00E9tude s\u00E9rologique","analyses s\u00E9rologiques","probably infectious asymptomatic forms is essential","recherche du coronavirus associ\u00E9","tomodensitom\u00E9trie thoracique objective","sub pleural ground glass appearance","Serological analyses will allow better identification","liver cell necrosis but no respiratory symptoms","an epidemic","seasonal recurrence","pharyngeal washings were negative","scan showed","incomplete clinical presentations","aspect","cannot be ignored","hyperthermie isol\u00E9e","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie de pneumopathies atypiques","lymphop\u00E9nie","Guandong","nouveaux foyers survenus","recrudescence saisonni\u00E8re","heure","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements","verre d\u00E9poli","Early","hours","r\u00E9gion Chinoise","cytolyse h\u00E9patique","Guangdong","contexte"],"language":"fr"},

According to WHO estimations, 600 million cases of diseases caused by contaminated food were noted in 2010, including almost 350 million caused by pathogenic bacteria. Campylobacter, Salmonella, as well as Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes may dwell in livestock (poultry, cattle, and swine) but are also found in wild animals, pets, fish, and rodents. Animals, often being asymptomatic carriers of pathogens, excrete them with faeces, thus delivering them to the environment. Therefore, pathogens may invade new individuals, as well as reside on vegetables and fruits. Pathogenic bacteria also penetrate food production areas and may remain there in the form of a biofilm covering the surfaces of machines and equipment. A common occurrence of microbes in food products, as well as their improper or careless processing, leads to common poisonings. Symptoms of foodborne infections may be mild, sometimes flu-like, but they also may be accompanied by severe complications, some even fatal.

METHODS: We present the first 2 years of data collected from a 5-year, prospective, cohort study of swine-exposed and -unexposed participants at 6 swine farms in China. We conducted serological and virological surveillance to examine evidence for swine influenza A virus infection in humans. RESULTS: Of the 658 participants (521 swine-exposed and 137 swine-unexposed), 207 (31.5%) seroconverted against at least 1 swine influenza virus subtype (swine H1N1 or H3N2). Swine-exposed participants\u2019 microneutralization titers, especially those enrolled at confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), were higher against the swine H1N1 virus than were other participants at 12 and 24 months. Despite elevated titers, among the 187 study subjects for whom we had complete follow-up, participants working at swine CAFOs had significantly greater odds of seroconverting against both the swine H1N1 (odds ratio [OR] 19.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.55\u2013358.65) and swine H3N2 (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.16\u20138.01) viruses, compared to unexposed and non-CAFO swine workers with less intense swine exposure. CONCLUSIONS: While some of the observed increased risk against swine viruses may have been explained by exposure to human influenza strains, study data suggest that even with elevated preexisting antibodies, swine-exposed workers were at high risk of infection with enzootic swine influenza A viruses.","publish_time":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borkenhagen, Laura K; Wang, Guo-Lin; Simmons, Ryan A; Bi, Zhen-Qiang; Lu, Bing; Wang, Xian-Jun; Wang, Chuang-Xin; Chen, Shan-Hui; Song, Shao-Xia; Li, Min; Zhao, Teng; Wu, Meng-Na; Park, Lawrence P; Cao, Wu-Chun; Ma, Mai-Juan; Gray, Gregory C","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7dde4a6a21e6ca7cf08c236d1510e2afabc54d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108185.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504322/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["swine viruses","swine-unexposed","swine CAFOs","swine H3N2","swine farms","swine H1N1 virus","enzootic swine influenza","swine-exposed workers","cohort study of swine","swine influenza virus subtype","intense swine exposure","non-CAFO swine workers","Swine-exposed participants\u2019 microneutralization titers","unexposed participants","virus infection","zoonotic influenza virus emergence","study data","human influenza strains","study subjects","elevated titers","China","high risk of infection","odds ratio","prospective studies","years of data","observed increased risk","elevated preexisting antibodies","greater odds of seroconverting","evidence","hotspot","complete follow-up","confined animal feeding operations","virological surveillance","occupational risks","humans","confidence interval","infections","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","months","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

First, the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps was determined by the means of NBT reduction and changes in cell conformation. And the variations of NOS activity in shrimps after challenge with WSSV intramuscularly were evaluated through the analysis of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate (both as NO derivates) concentrations. The result showed that NOS activity in the haemocytes of F. chinensis increased slightly from 0 to 12h postchallenge, indicated by the variations of l-citrulline (from 11.15\u00B10.10 to 12.08\u00B10.64\u03BCM) and total nitrite/nitrate concentrations (from 10.45\u00B10.65 to 12.67\u00B10.52\u03BCM). Then it decreased sharply till the end of the experiment (84h postchallenge), the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 84h were 1.58\u00B10.24 and 2.69\u00B10.70\u03BCM, respectively. The LPS-stimulated NOS activity kept constant during the experiment. However, in M. japonicus, the NOS activity kept increasing during the first 72h postchallenge, the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate increased from 7.82\u00B10.77 at 0h to 10.79\u00B10.50\u03BCM at 72h, and from 8.98\u00B10.43 at 0h to 11.20\u00B10.37\u03BCM at 72h, respectively. Then it decreased till the end of the experiment (216h postchallenge), and the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 216h were 5.66\u00B10.27 and 4.68\u00B10.16\u03BCM, respectively. More importantly, an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity was observed in M. japonicus at 48h postchallenge, which was about 4 times higher than that in the control group of health shrimps. In correspondence with the difference of NOS activity between the two species of shrimps, the cumulative mortalities of the shrimps were also different. All shrimps of F. chinensis in the mortality experiment died in 66h, much more quickly than M. japonicus, whose accumulative mortality reached 100% after 240h. Data here reported let us hypothesize that NOS activity in the haemocytes of shrimps F. chinensis and M. japonicus responses to WSSV infection differently, and this might be one of the reasons for the different susceptibility of F. chinensis and M. japonicus to WSSV infection.","publish_time":"2006-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Guojian; Yu, Rencheng; Zhou, Mingjiang","journal":"Nitric Oxide","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31a1d28e9d3bf612e830b2d5c3cbd5ec17d729ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110546.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860305001722; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1089860305001722","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marsupenaeus"],"organizations":["NBT","WSSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h postchallenge","variations of NOS activity","difference of NOS activity","\u03BCM","LPS-stimulated NOS activity","total nitrite","nitrate concentrations","citrulline","species of shrimps","haemocytes of shrimps Fenneropenaeus chinensis","WSSV infection","japonicus responses","Marsupenaeus japonicus","virus infection","mortality experiment","control group of health shrimps","end","different susceptibility","accumulative mortality","apparent increase of LPS","white spot syndrome virus","Osbeck","changes","characteristics","means of NBT reduction","constant","cumulative mortalities","cell conformation","nitric oxide synthase","times higher","correspondence","analysis","reasons","derivates","result","Data"],"language":"en"},

Cases were hospitalized children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were children from the same setting without any features suggestive of pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all subjects; 19 viruses and 5 bacteria were identified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.

CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae, RSV, and rhinovirus may be the major microorganisms associated with pneumonia infections in children \u003C5 years of age from developing and emerging countries. Increasing S. pneumoniae vaccination coverage may substantially reduce the burden of pneumonia among children in developing countries.","publish_time":"2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00E9net, Thomas; S\u00E1nchez Picot, Valentina; Messaoudi, M\u00E9lina; Chou, Monidarin; Eap, Tekchheng; Wang, Jianwei; Shen, Kunling; Pape, Jean-William; Rouzier, Vanessa; Awasthi, Shally; Pandey, Nitin; Bavdekar, Ashish; Sanghavi, Sonali; Robinson, Annick; Rakoto-Andrianarivelo, Mala; Sylla, Maryam; Diallo, Souleymane; Nymadawa, Pagbajabyn; Naranbat, Nymadawaagiin; Russomando, Graciela; Basualdo, Wilma; Komurian-Pradel, Florence; Endtz, Hubert; Vanhems, Philippe; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad63e6c4585346d7c23cdf6d2c68813c16cc940d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108107.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28605562/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix378","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["GABRIEL","S. pneumoniae","Streptococcus","Increasing S."],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Haiti","India","Mali"],"keyphrases":["children","burden of pneumonia","pneumonia infections","confirmed pneumonia","developing countries","Streptococcus pneumoniae","emerging countries","features suggestive of pneumonia","rhinovirus","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","RSV","Low-income countries","controls","Cases","pneumoniae vaccination coverage","respiratory syncytial virus","years of age","aPAF","parainfluenza virus","major microorganisms","Infectious diseases","respiratory samples","case-control study","prospective observational study","adjusted population attributable fraction","leading infectious cause of child mortality","human metapneumovirus","sex","GABRIEL","Biological Research","Global Approach","Epidemics","multivariate logistic regression analysis","India","setting","time period","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","subjects","Mali","Haiti","bacteria","Madagascar","sites","pathogens","Mongolia","Cambodia","China","network","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Nasopharyngeal swabs","Paraguay","viruses","METHODS","confidence interval","Associations","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Recently, Enterovirus A71 (EVA71) infection was found to hijack the VCP protein. However, the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear. Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71. Together, these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71.","publish_time":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Jingjing; Wang, Meng; Wang, Min; Dun, Ying; Zhu, Liuyao; Yi, Zhigang; Zhang, Shuye","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d534fb8f6a5bd0fa18c5408a8751e1ab8ff25801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289342/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220300691; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220300691; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197974","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EVA71 infection","knockdown of VCP","VCP protein","UFD1 knockdown","knockdown of UFD1","coreceptor of EVA71","novel roles of VCP","activity of EVA71 pseudovirus","subsequent entry of EVA71","enterovirus infection","known VCP-cofactors","EVA71 life cycle","cofactor UFD1","critical roles","ubiquitin recognition factor","viral infections","single round infection","Enterovirus A71","siRNA knockdown experiments","multiple human Enterovirus","levels of nucleolin protein","RNA interference","viral replication","NPL4 homolog","ATPase activity","virus entry","replicon RNA transfection assays","ER associated degradation","dominant negative mutant","cells","binding","chemical inhibitor","serotypes","various cellular activities","Abstract Valosin","data","results","addition","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Many picornaviruses induce autophagy to benefit viral replication, but an understanding of how autophagy occurs remains incomplete. In this study, we explored whether coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection induced autophagy through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Methods In CVB3-infected HeLa cells, the specific molecules of ER stress and autophagy were detected using Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and confocal microscopy. Then PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK) inhibitor, inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1) inhibitor, or activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) inhibitor worked on CVB3-infected cells, their effect on autophagy was assessed by Western blotting for detecting microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Results CVB3 infection induced ER stress, and ER stress sensors PERK/eIF2\u03B1, IRE1/XBP1, and ATF6 were activated. CVB3 infection increased the accumulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 punctuation and induced the conversion from LC3-I to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3-1 (LC3-II). CVB3 infection still decreased the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p-mTOR. Inhibition of PERK, IRE1, or ATF6 significantly decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in CVB3-infected HeLa cells. Conclusion CVB3 infection induced autophagy through ER stress in HeLa cells, and PERK, IRE1, and ATF6a pathways participated in the regulation of autophagy. Our data suggested that ER stress may inhibit mTOR signaling pathway to induce autophagy during CVB3 infection.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"LUO, Xiao Nuan; YAO, Hai Lan; SONG, Juan; SONG, Qin Qin; SHI, Bing Tian; XIA, Dong; HAN, Jun","journal":"Biomedical and Environmental Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9588bf4e942a3759cd94aa1af36826d25633752.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2018.115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398819300091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636656/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398819300091","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CVB3-infected cells","Results CVB3 infection","Conclusion CVB3 infection","regulation of autophagy","CVB3-infected HeLa cells","ER stress sensors PERK","ER protein kinase","IRE1","LC3 punctuation","ratio of LC3","specific molecules of ER stress","Abstract Objective Autophagy","inhibitor","phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3","Inhibition of PERK","Western blotting","p-mTOR","microtubule-associated protein light chain","accumulation of green fluorescent protein","transcription factor","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","conserved intracellular degradation pathway","RT-PCR","GFP","eIF2\u03B1","endoplasmic reticulum","expression of mammalian target of rapamycin","effect","ATF6a pathways","coxsackievirus B3","understanding","viral replication","conversion","XBP1","inositol","Methods","picornaviruses","PKR","confocal microscopy","study","data"],"language":"en"},

Recently, there has been growing insight into the biological functions of NK cells, in particular into their roles in infection, tumorurveillance and autoimmunity. Under these pathophysiological circumstances, NK cells readily home to the central nervous system (CNS) tissues to combat infection and presumably to curb progression of tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur in this setting. Paradoxically, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role for autoimmune responses within the CNS. As in the periphery, NK cells act in concert with T cells and other lymphocytes responsible for CNS pathology and immune regulation. Insights into the molecular signals and pathways governing the diverse biological effects of NK cells are keys for designing NK cell-based therapy for CNS infections, tumor and autoimmune diseases.NK cells readily accumulate in homing to CNS tissues under the pathophysiological situations. This process is tightly controlled by a number of chemokines and chemokine receptors. There is ample of evidence that NK cells within the CNS contribute to the control of infections and might limit progression of certain tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur. In certain autoimmune conditions of the CNS, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role. Disassociation of disease-inhibiting versus disease-promoting effects of NK cells is a key to harnessing NK cells for therapeutic purposes. To achieve this goal, a generation of genetic models with selective NK cell deficiency, and development of reagents (antibodies) for visualizing subsets of NK cells in situ will be necessary.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Fu-Dong; Ransohoff, Richard M.","journal":"Natural Killer Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e94b06a5ff796595f1ba5d07fd544145f7d46fcc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150147.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123704542000284; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123704542000284","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Publisher Summary Natural","NK","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["harnessing NK cells","biological functions of NK cells","visualizing subsets of NK cells","T cells","diverse biological effects of NK cells","selective NK cell deficiency","NK cell-based therapy","CNS infections","CNS tissues","CNS pathology","glial cell damage","progression of tumor","progression of certain tumor","autoimmune diseases","autoimmune responses","certain autoimmune conditions","inhibitory role","Bystander neuronal","innate immune system","lymphocytes responsible","immune regulation","control of infections","pathophysiological situations","pathophysiological circumstances","Disassociation of disease","large granular lymphocytes","central nervous system","keys","generation of genetic models","pathways","development of reagents","prominent component","concert","cytokine secretion","antibodies","roles","homing","Publisher Summary Natural killer","variety of insults","molecular signals","therapeutic purposes","cytolytic activity","number of chemokines","ample of evidence","chemokine receptors","Insights","goal","tumorurveillance","autoimmunity","periphery","setting","process"],"language":"en"},

Studies of IFN-\u03BB4 in animals should help improve our understanding of the biology of this novel clinically important interferon in normal and disease conditions.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paquin, Ashley; Onabajo, Olusegun O.; Tang, Wei; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila","journal":"J Interferon Cytokine Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/176fa00106dc0e7b0ef19c0b606aa80cd14e4057.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4722605.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26308395/; https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.2015.0096","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonhuman IFN-\u03BB4 proteins","mammalian IFN-\u03BB4 orthologs","Studies of IFN","recombinant human","\u0394G allele","important interferon","induction of interferon","human hepatic cell line","novel type","protein sequences","nonhuman mammals","cytoplasmic proteins","infection","functional properties","impaired ability","genetic variant rs368234815-TT","confocal imaging","flow cytometry","hepatitis C virus","strong clinical significance","Western blotting","monoclonal antibody","HCV","differences","humans","HepG2","disease conditions","biology","comparative analysis","animals","understanding","Africans","Carriers","Europeans","subset of individuals","Asians","study"],"language":"en"},

Multi-omics studies with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are challenging as the requirements of biosafety level 3 containment limit the numbers of samples that can be safely managed. To address these issues, the multi-omics sample preparation technique MPLEx (metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction) was developed to partition a single sample into three distinct parts (metabolites, proteins, and lipids) for multi-omics analysis, while simultaneously inactivating MERS-CoV by solubilizing and disrupting the viral envelope and denaturing viral proteins. Here we describe the MPLEx protocol, highlight the step of inactivation, and describe the details of downstream processing, instrumental analysis of the three separate analytes, and their subsequent informatics pipelines.","publish_time":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicora, Carrie D.; Sims, Amy C.; Bloodsworth, Kent J.; Kim, Young-Mo; Moore, Ronald J.; Kyle, Jennifer E.; Nakayasu, Ernesto S.; Metz, Thomas O.","journal":"MERS Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b75473c62f53c71ee4d5cd2f9838a20a4c15449a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121680.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31883096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["multi-omics analysis","Multi-omics studies","multi-omics sample preparation technique MPLEx","viral proteins","inactivating MERS-CoV","instrumental analysis","single sample","MPLEx protocol","viral envelope","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","therapeutic targets","induced changes","separate analytes","detailed snapshot of virus","containment","distinct parts","metabolites","lipidomics","lipids","identification of novel prophylactic","details of downstream processing","MS","integrated proteomics","infection","host","requirements of biosafety level","issues","subsequent informatics pipelines","lessening disease severity","numbers of samples","metabolomics","lipid extraction","step of inactivation","Mass spectrometry"],"language":"en"},

Influenzanet is a participatory surveillance system monitoring the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Europe since 2003. It is based on data provided by volunteers who self-report their symptoms via the Internet throughout the influenza season and currently involves 10 countries. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe the Influenzanet system and provide an overview of results from several analyses that have been performed with the collected data, which include participant representativeness analyses, data validation (comparing ILI incidence rates between Influenzanet and sentinel medical practice networks), identification of ILI risk factors, and influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies previously published. Additionally, we present new VE analyses for the Netherlands, stratified by age and chronic illness and offer suggestions for further work and considerations on the continuity and sustainability of the participatory system. METHODS: Influenzanet comprises country-specific websites where residents can register to become volunteers to support influenza surveillance and have access to influenza-related information. Participants are recruited through different communication channels. Following registration, volunteers submit an intake questionnaire with their postal code and sociodemographic and medical characteristics, after which they are invited to report their symptoms via a weekly electronic newsletter reminder. Several thousands of participants have been engaged yearly in Influenzanet, with over 36,000 volunteers in the 2015-16 season alone. RESULTS: In summary, for some traits and in some countries (eg, influenza vaccination rates in the Netherlands), Influenzanet participants were representative of the general population. However, for other traits, they were not (eg, participants underrepresent the youngest and oldest age groups in 7 countries). The incidence of ILI in Influenzanet was found to be closely correlated although quantitatively higher than that obtained by the sentinel medical practice networks. Various risk factors for acquiring an ILI infection were identified. The VE studies performed with Influenzanet data suggest that this surveillance system could develop into a complementary tool to measure the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, eventually in real time. CONCLUSIONS: Results from these analyses illustrate that Influenzanet has developed into a fast and flexible monitoring system that can complement the traditional influenza surveillance performed by sentinel medical practices. The uniformity of Influenzanet allows for direct comparison of ILI rates between countries. It also has the important advantage of yielding individual data, which can be used to identify risk factors. The way in which the Influenzanet system is constructed allows the collection of data that could be extended beyond those of ILI cases to monitor pandemic influenza and other common or emerging diseases.","publish_time":"2017-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koppeschaar, Carl E; Colizza, Vittoria; Guerrisi, Caroline; Turbelin, Cl\u00E9ment; Duggan, Jim; Edmunds, W John; Kjels\u00F8, Charlotte; Mexia, Ricardo; Moreno, Yamir; Meloni, Sandro; Paolotti, Daniela; Perrotta, Daniela; van Straten, Edward; Franco, Ana O","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c682f8e05b7363e2407b3055826f6c93b6c1f3ad.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f2ce9e73f368fc128cd28a0246b3ff8aa3079a42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5627046.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.7429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["Europe","Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["Influenzanet system","Influenzanet data","Influenzanet participants","incidence of influenza","uniformity of Influenzanet","influenza season","pandemic influenza","traditional influenza surveillance","incidence of ILI","influenza vaccine effectiveness","influenza vaccination rates","ILI incidence rates","participatory surveillance system","ILI cases","ILI infection","participatory system","countries","volunteers","influenza-related information","data validation","identification of ILI risk factors","collected data","collection of data","direct comparison of ILI rates","health surveillance","VE studies","flexible monitoring system","sentinel medical practice networks","sentinel medical practices","new VE analyses","medical characteristics","thousands of participants","Various risk factors","important advantage of yielding individual data","Netherlands","important tool","Internet","symptoms","participant representativeness analyses","epidemiological studies","overview of results","traits","complementary tool","chronic illness","self-report","oldest age groups","different communication channels","growth of digital communication technologies","postal code","intake questionnaire","suggestions","continuity","access","country-specific websites","considerations","weekly electronic newsletter reminder","residents","sustainability","wide availability","emerging diseases","general population","registration","METHODS","real time","paper","BACKGROUND","summary","CONCLUSIONS","Europe","way","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Deep sequencing has the potential to reveal the mutant spectrum within a viral sample at high resolution, thus enabling the close examination of viral mutational dynamics both within- and between-hosts. The challenge however, is to accurately model the errors in the sequencing data and differentiate real viral mutations, particularly those that exist at low frequencies, from sequencing errors. RESULTS: We demonstrate that overlapping read pairs (ORP) -- generated by combining short fragment sequencing libraries and longer sequencing reads -- significantly reduce sequencing error rates and improve rare variant detection accuracy. Using this sequencing protocol and an error model optimized for variant detection, we are able to capture a large number of genetic mutations present within a viral population at ultra-low frequency levels (\u003C0.05%). CONCLUSIONS: Our rare variant detection strategies have important implications beyond viral evolution and can be applied to any basic and clinical research area that requires the identification of rare mutations.","publish_time":"2013-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen-Harris, Haiyin; Borucki, Monica K; Torres, Clinton; Slezak, Tom R; Allen, Jonathan E","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/652fdea5cc6137511f2de628166875707670b10b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3599684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23402258/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-96","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequencing errors","sequencing reads","sequencing data","sequencing protocol","Deep sequencing","sequencing error rates","High throughput sequencing","viral population","viral sample","area of viral evolution","real viral mutations","short fragment sequencing libraries","rare variant detection strategies","rare variant detection accuracy","identification of rare mutations","close examination of viral mutational dynamics","error model","high resolution","low frequencies","large number of genetic mutations present","clinical research area","ultra-low frequency levels","important implications","mutant spectrum","potential","CONCLUSIONS","transformative impact","BACKGOUND","pairs","ORP","hosts","challenge","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The virus infects pigs of all ages, but it cause severe clinical disease in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality. Currently, available vaccines are not completely effective and feedback methods utilizing PEDV infected material has variable success in preventing reinfection. Comprehensive information on the levels and duration of effector/memory IgA and IgG antibody secreting B cell response in the intestines and lymphoid organs of PEDV-infected sows, and their association with specific antibody levels in clinical samples such as plasma, oral fluid, and feces is important. Therefore, our goal in this study was to quantify PEDV specific IgA and IgG B cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post-infection in commercial swine herds, including parity one and higher sows. Our data indicated that evaluation of both PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid (but not feces) samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis. PEDV specific B cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months, and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples; but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post-infection. In conclusion, in sows infected with PEDV the presence of effector/memory B cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months post-infection, suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates, but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses.","publish_time":"2015-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ouyang, Kang; Shyu, Duan-Liang; Dhakal, Santosh; Hiremath, Jagadish; Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Lakshmanappa, Yashavanth S.; Guo, Rui; Ransburgh, Russell; Bondra, Kathryn M.; Gauger, Phillip; Zhang, Jianqiang; Specht, Terry; Gilbertie, Aaron; Minton, William; Fang, Ying; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4699368.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-015-0285-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26667229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV specific IgA","plasma","PEDV specific B cell response","specific antibody levels","PEDV infected material","IgG antibody levels","spleen of infected sows","higher sows","memory B cell response","months post-infection","IgG B cell responses","IgG antibody secreting B cell response","lymphoid organs of PEDV","oral fluid samples","memory IgA","clinical samples","strong virus neutralization titers","severe clinical disease","feces","reinfection","disease diagnosis","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","devastating enteric disease","duration of effector","presence of effector","swine industry","commercial swine herds","neonatal suckling pigs","intestines","feedback methods","association","maternal immunity","variable success","neonates","parity","potential","challenge studies","ages","study","evaluation","associates","Comprehensive information","available vaccines","data","conclusion","goal","mortality"],"language":"en"},

However, the availability of these vaccines will be dependent on sustained funding for clinical trials and the preparation of clinically acceptable manufactured material during inter-epidemic periods.","publish_time":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noad, Rob J.; Simpson, Karl; Fooks, Anthony R.; Hewson, Roger; Gilbert, Sarah C.; Stevens, Mark P.; Hosie, Margaret J.; Prior, Joann; Kinsey, Anna M.; Entrican, Gary; Simpson, Andrew; Whitty, Christopher J.M.; Carroll, Miles W","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81230f87c0f91c179b1111a9d7841b3426bd4a51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127063.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19311971; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522809/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19311971","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","World Health Organisation"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["priority diseases","outbreak diseases","development of vaccines","priority pathogens","Infectious Diseases","UK pathogen priority list","clinical progress","emerging diseases vaccine research","UK Prime Minister","clinical trials","Ebola outbreak","clear technical progress","National Institutes of Allergy","acceptable manufactured material","preparation","World Health Organisation","expert panel","sustained funding","inter-epidemic periods","West Africa","instructions","prioritisation of spending","organisations","process","potential","meeting report","future epidemics","availability","total","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to use the metagenomic sequencing approach to characterize the viral diversity in respiratory samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. We have investigated 86 respiratory samples received from various hospitals in Kuwait between 2015 and 2016 for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. A metagenomic approach using the next\u2010generation sequencer to characterize viruses was used. According to the metagenomic analysis, an average of 145, 019 reads were identified, and 2% of these reads were of viral origin. Also, metagenomic analysis of the viral sequences revealed many known respiratory viruses, which were detected in 30.2% of the clinical samples. Also, sequences of non\u2010respiratory viruses were detected in 14% of the clinical samples, while sequences of non\u2010human viruses were detected in 55.8% of the clinical samples. The average genome coverage of the viruses was 12% with the highest genome coverage of 99.2% for respiratory syncytial virus, and the lowest was 1% for torque teno midi virus 2. Our results showed 47.7% agreement between multiplex Real\u2010Time PCR and metagenomics sequencing in the detection of respiratory viruses in the clinical samples. Though there are some difficulties in using this method to clinical samples such as specimen quality, these observations are indicative of the promising utility of the metagenomic sequencing approach for the identification of respiratory viruses in patients with respiratory tract infections.","publish_time":"2017-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madi, Nada; Al\u2010Nakib, Widad; Mustafa, Abu Salim; Habibi, Nazima","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72df5c13858e70a641dfa8b9d3b25efdc5632003.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167075.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29083040/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.24984","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kuwait"],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","known respiratory viruses","clinical samples","detection of respiratory viruses","identification of respiratory viruses","sequences of non\u2010respiratory viruses","metagenomic approach","metagenomic sequencing approach","novel viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","diagnosis of respiratory tract infections","metagenomic analysis","sequences of non\u2010human viruses","generation sequencing","viral sequences","metagenomics sequencing","known method","patients","viral diversity","viral origin","average genome coverage","reads","highest genome coverage","generation sequencer","torque teno midi virus","promising utility","multiplex Real\u2010Time PCR","specimen quality","agreement","observations","target independent","various hospitals","Kuwait","results","difficulties","study"],"language":"en"},

The current commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for IBV specific antibody detection are mostly based on the whole virion, and few serological tests based on nonstructural proteins of IBV have been developed. Herein, an alternative indirect ELISA for detection of IBV antibody was developed with IBV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) produced by Escherichia coli. Using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a commercial ELISA kit as reference, we optimized the nsp5-ELISA and determined its cut-off as 0.12. The diagnostic sensitivity (DSN), specificity (DSP) and accuracy of the nsp5-ELISA were 93.11%, 95.38% and 93.33%, respectively, compared with IFA in 660 field serum samples, and were 98.11%, 95.00% and 97.62%, respectively, compared with the commercial IBV ELISA kit (IDEXX) in 126 field sera samples. Furthermore, a time course of IBV specific antibody level detected by nsp5-ELISA following IBV infection and vaccination is consistent with that of IBV antibody detected by the commercial ELISA kit. The results presented in this study indicate that nsp5-ELISA has the potential to serve as a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method for IBV antibody detection. This study is the first to report the development of an nsp-based ELISA to detect an antibody to IBV.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Jing; Shi, Tingting; Sun, Dongnan; Mo, Kaikun; Yan, Yan; Jin, Yulan; Liao, Min; Zhou, Jiyong","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2cd93fc69bc2a613d20be9bc9311a7ecf23005e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28223026/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416305298; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416305298; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.01.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IFA","IBV ELISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp5-ELISA","commercial IBV ELISA kit","detection of IBV antibody","IBV antibody detection","IBV infection","IBV specific antibody detection","commercial ELISA kit","nonstructural proteins of IBV","IBV nonstructural protein","nsp-based ELISA","alternative indirect ELISA","time course of IBV specific antibody level","IFA","study","indirect immunofluorescence assay","field sera samples","field serum samples","available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","kits","IDEXX","cost-effective method","specificity","vaccination","serological tests","DSN","DSP","Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus","accuracy","reference","diagnostic sensitivity","development","potential","important poultry pathogens","virion","Escherichia coli","cut-off","results"],"language":"en"},

In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information could help to inform future decisions about the restructuring of existing health services by governments, public health bodies and policy makers in response to public health crises such as COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cadogan, Cathal A.; Hughes, Carmel M.","journal":"Research in social \u0026 administrative pharmacy : RSAP","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/026f91ab18b56191f0bd6155bdca07777aaf7167.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120302928; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120302928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health response","public health bodies","public health crises","restructuring of existing health services","number of health professions","existing services","continuity of healthcare services","community pharmacists","scope of community pharmacy practice","healthcare providers","global spread of COVID","use of current available resources","general practice","current pandemic","policy makers","governments","future decisions","adaptive methods of practising","roles","activities","areas","unrealised potential","countries","unprecedented demands","time of crisis","relieving pressure","key role","ways","article","information","order"],"language":"en"},

Earlier work has shown that PC1 and PC2 assemble into a polycystin complex implicated in kidney morphogenesis. PC2 also assembles into homomers of uncertain functional significance. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that direct polycystin complex assembly and specify its functions. We have identified a coiled coil in the C-terminus of PC2 that functions as a homodimerization domain essential for PC1 binding but not for its self-oligomerization. Dimerization-defective PC2 mutants were unable to reconstitute PC1/PC2 complexes either at the plasma membrane (PM) or at PM-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions but could still function as ER Ca(2\u002B)-release channels. Expression of dimerization-defective PC2 mutants in zebrafish resulted in a cystic phenotype but had lesser effects on organ laterality. We conclude that C-terminal dimerization of PC2 specifies the formation of polycystin complexes but not formation of ER-localized PC2 channels. Mutations that affect PC2 C-terminal homo- and heteromerization are the likely molecular basis of cyst formation in ADPKD.","publish_time":"2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giamarchi, Aur\u00E9lie; Feng, Shuang; Rodat-Despoix, Lise; Xu, Yaoxian; Bubenshchikova, Ekaterina; Newby, Linda J; Hao, Jizhe; Gaudioso, Christelle; Crest, Marcel; Lupas, Andrei N; Honor\u00E9, Eric; Williamson, Michael P; Obara, Tomoko; Ong, Albert CM; Delmas, Patrick","journal":"The EMBO Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0bcde0c6eb57c80f01dd64aa54a5adf4fe7a059.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9bf39bc9fe641a3a0c44ac36849eaefdef4d1fda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2857461.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2857461?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20168298/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2010.18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PC2 complexes","C-terminal dimerization of PC2","localized PC2 channels","Dimerization-defective PC2 mutants","PC2 C-terminal homo","formation of polycystin complexes","formation of ER","PC1 binding","direct polycystin complex assembly","ADPKD","functions","C-terminus","Expression of dimerization","ER Ca","mutations","likely molecular basis of cyst formation","molecular mechanisms","kidney morphogenesis","release channels","PM-endoplasmic reticulum","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease","heteromerization","zebrafish","homodimerization domain essential","lesser effects","cystic phenotype","plasma membrane","PKD1","junctions","organ laterality","homomers of uncertain functional significance","coiled coil","PKD2","self-oligomerization","Earlier work"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, oseltamivir reduced the replication of influenza A viruses in a dose dependent manner and prevented the impairment of the epithelial barrier function and cytotoxicity until 4 days of infection.

Although it is well tolerated by most patients and helps in the achievement of complete remission, a few rare imatinib-associated adverse effects such as pulmonary interstitial fibrosis have been reported. Because of its rareity, the clinical features of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) remain unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old Chinese man with chronic myeloid leukemia received oral treatment with imatinib and initially exhibited a good response. However, he presented with cough and fever 9 months after treatment initiation. DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary computed tomography indicated diffuse interstitial fibrosis in both lungs. All tests for possible infectious pathologies provided negative results. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and treated with antibiotics; however, there was no improvement. On the basis of a suspicion of imatinib-induced ILD, imatinib was discontinued and prednisone treatment was initiated. OUTCOMES: The patient\u0027s symptoms ameliorated with treatment, and imatinib was reintroduced. However, he developed cough and dyspnea again, and his treatment was switched to nilotinib as a second-line regimen. He was regularly monitored, and although his clinical symptoms ameliorated, computed tomography performed 29 months after he was diagnosed with ILD showed irreversible pulmonary interstitial fibrosis without progression. LESSONS: Clinicians should consider the possibility of severe irreversible ILD and carefully monitor patients receiving imatinib treatment.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ping; Huang, Jingfeng; Jin, Fangfang; Pan, Jiaohai; Ouyang, Guifang","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8c88bae765a67eb93e119820caa702994e13c1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6407980.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000014402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["imatinib treatment","rare imatinib","Imatinib mesylate","suspicion of imatinib","clinical features of imatinib","oral treatment","treatment initiation","prednisone treatment","irreversible pulmonary interstitial fibrosis","diffuse interstitial fibrosis","interstitial pneumonia","induced ILD","interstitial lung disease","Pulmonary computed tomography","chronic myeloid leukemia","possibility of severe irreversible ILD","months","clinical symptoms","patients","cough","patient\u0027s symptoms","PATIENT CONCERNS","year-old Chinese man","adverse effects","classic tyrosine kinase inhibitor","possible infectious pathologies","negative results","tests","achievement of complete remission","DIAGNOSES","fever","progression","Clinicians","nilotinib","rareity","lungs","RATIONALE","line regimen","LESSONS","OUTCOMES","antibiotics","good response","basis","dyspnea","INTERVENTIONS","improvement"],"language":"en"},

Method: Three different protocols (pre\u2010, simultaneous and post\u2010treatments) were used to verify the effect of addition time of the variables on PV1 replication by crystal violet method and relative viral RNA quantification by real\u2010time PCR for analysing in which step of virus replication the variables could interfere. Conclusions: Data revealed that the B. dracunculifolia showed the best antiviral activity percentage in the simultaneous treatment, as well as lower relative viral quantification by real\u2010time PCR.

An isolation ward is a facility to isolate patients physically and to care them safely. One way to isolate a patient physically is to build a negative pressure isolation facility. However, unexpected failure or misuse of such facility makes it difficult to maintain negative pressure and eventually causes secondary infection, leaking the infectious pathogen to outside of the isolation ward. This study identifies the amount and velocity of leakage air from a patient ward by tracer gas experiment under abnormal operations of an isolation facility. In addition, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allowed us to observe the outflow mechanism of pollutant. The results show that abnormal operations of a facility spreads pathogens to neighboring areas immediately and timely actions should be prepared against them.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jeong-Yeon; Sung, Minki","journal":"Energy Procedia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/022f57ee7cc12a028138116e56177bc69d3f3464.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876610215019967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288887/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.264; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610215019967","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation ward","negative pressure isolation facility","isolation facilities","patient ward","facility spreads pathogens","abnormal operations","infectious pathogen","recent outbreaks of infectious diseases","tracer gas experiment","SARS","Influenza","severe acute respiratory syndrome","areas","secondary infection","important role","velocity of leakage air","addition","computational fluid dynamics","CFD","misuse","Ebola","unexpected failure","initial stage","timely actions","outflow mechanism of pollutant","results","patients","study","way"],"language":"en"},

Methods The experiment consisted of four parts: therapeutic action, prophylaxsis action, inhibition of virus attachment, and direct virucidal action. Cytopathic effect (CPE) and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) were used to assess antiviral activity. Results CB, epigoitrin, PEP and PEP \u002B ALK \u002B OA fractions from Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) extract significantly increased the viability of MDCK cells pre-infected with the virus compared with the virus control group in all the dilutions (P \u003C 0.01).

We investigated changes in fecal microbiomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and associations with severity and fecal shedding of virus. METHODS We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of fecal samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, from February 5 through March 17, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 or 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge; disease was categorized as mild (no radiographic evidence of pneumonia), moderate (pneumonia was present), severe (respiratory rate \u226530/min, or oxygen saturation \u226493% when breathing ambient air), or critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring intensive care). We compared microbiome data with those from 6 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 15 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed gut microbiome profiles in association with disease severity and changes in fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in fecal microbiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals, at time of hospitalization and at all timepoints during hospitalization. Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms. The baseline abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi correlated with COVID-19 severity; there was an inverse correlation between abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (an anti-inflammatory bacterium) and disease severity. Over the course of hospitalization, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, which downregulate expression of ACE2 in murine gut, correlated inversely with SARS-CoV-2 load in fecal samples from patients. CONCLUSIONS In a pilot study of 15 patients with COVID-19, we found persistent alterations in the fecal microbiome during the time of hospitalization, compared with controls. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Strategies to alter the intestinal microbiota might reduce disease severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuo, Tao; Zhang, Fen; Lui, Grace C.Y.; Yeoh, Yun Kit; Li, Amy Y.L.; Zhan, Hui; Wan, Yating; Chung, Arthur; Cheung, Chun Peng; Chen, Nan; Lai, Christopher K.C.; Chen, Zigui; Tso, Eugene Y.K.; Fung, Kitty S.C.; Chan, Veronica; Ling, Lowell; Joynt, Gavin; Hui, David S.C.; Chan, Francis K.L.; Chan, Paul K.S.; Ng, Siew C.","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/237611ecafe34f49d793f86993584457f0b882a5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508520347016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508520347016?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.05.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["fecal shedding of SARS","SARS-CoV","fecal levels of SARS","fecal microbiomes of patients","disease severity","Fecal microbiota alterations","COVID","time of hospitalization","severity of infection","fecal shedding of virus","course of hospitalization","clearance of SARS","RESULTS Patients","controls","shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of fecal samples","gut microbiome profiles","Bacteroides dorei","Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron","Bacteroides massiliensis","Bacteroides ovatus","respiratory failure","gut dysbiosis","murine gut","changes","respiratory rate","significant alterations","persistent alterations","microbiome data","roles of gut commensal microbes","radiographic evidence of pneumonia","resolution of respiratory symptoms","Clostridium ramosum","organ failure","Clostridium hathewayi","intestinal microbiota","abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii","baseline abundance of Coprobacillus","shock","mechanical ventilation","depletion of beneficial commensals","susceptibility","anti-inflammatory bacterium","enrichment of opportunistic pathogens","inverse correlation","discharge","associations","load","expression of ACE2","METHODS","throat swabs","subjects","week","pilot study","AIMS","times","intensive care","healthy individuals","ambient air","community","Depleted symbionts","Abstract BACKGROUD","timepoints","Hong Kong","gastrointestinal tissues","CONCLUSIONS","Strategies","oxygen saturation"],"language":"en"},

Viruses are a major cause of EIDs, particularly \u2212ssRNA viruses. Many variables are involved in the emergence or reemergence of viruses. These can be classified into human factors, environmental/ecological factors, and viral factors and include urbanization, globalization, weather and climate change, and the genetic composition of the virus. The great majority of emerging viral diseases are zoonoses, notably transmitted by arthropods and nonhuman mammals. Flaviviruses include several notable vector-transmitted viruses, while rodents and bats are thought to be the natural reservoirs of arenaviruses and filoviruses, respectively. This chapter discusses several notable outbreaks of emerging and reemerging viruses, including the 2014\u201315 outbreak of Ebolavirus in West Africa.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Louten, Jennifer","journal":"Essential Human Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a07f9dcafd10cee69fe4ba4dccdc8925ea997553.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149331.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128009475000168; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009475000168","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["reemerging viruses","ssRNA viruses","reemergence of viruses","viral factors","notable vector-transmitted viruses","ecological factors","human factors","notable outbreaks of emerging","emerging infectious disease","great majority of emerging viral diseases","globalization","climate change","zoonoses","urbanization","genetic composition","weather","major cause of EIDs","bats","rodents","natural reservoirs of arenaviruses","outbreak of Ebolavirus","West Africa","arthropods","filoviruses","Flaviviruses","chapter","population","geographic location","nonhuman mammals","variables","pathogen"],"language":"en"},

Cardiac glycosides not only inhibit the pump function of Na,K-ATPase but also activate intracellular signal transduction pathways, which are important in many biological processes. Recently, antiviral effects have been described as a novel feature of Na,K-ATPase inhibition with the use of cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides have been reported to be effective against both DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex and RNA viruses such as influenza, chikungunya, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, among others. Consequently, cardiac glycosides have emerged as potential broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, with the great advantage of targeting cell host proteins, which help to minimize resistance to antiviral treatments, making them a very promising strategy against human viral infections. Here, we review the effect of cardiac glycosides on viral biology and the mechanisms by which these drugs impair the replication of this array of different viruses.","publish_time":"2018-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amarelle, Luciano; Lecuona, Emilia","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/717582da95cea3e8b268b404e9f1ecc486fff6c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6121263.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30042322/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19082154","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of cardiac glycosides","use of cardiac glycosides","RNA viruses","DNA viruses","ATPase inhibition","antiviral treatments","novel feature of Na","antiviral effects","potential broad-spectrum antiviral drugs","array of different viruses","pump function of Na","viral biology","novel concepts","biological roles","biological processes","human viral infections","great advantage of targeting cell host proteins","chikungunya","cytomegalovirus","herpes simplex","coronavirus","influenza","structure","physiology","promising strategy","intracellular signal transduction pathways","replication","mechanisms","respiratory syncytial virus","resistance","years"],"language":"en"},

Drugs are powerful substances with a great capacity to cause harm if misused or overused. Even when used correctly, pharmaceuticals can elicit disputes about their relative harms and benefits in specific situations. The establishment of modern intermediaries \u2013 physicians or pharmacists \u2013 in the allocation of the most powerful drugs increases the potential for conflict between those who control the resource and those who desire access to it. The size and influence of the pharmaceutical\u2013industrial complex places disproportionate power in those whose interests lie in promoting and expanding pharmaceutical use in society. The expense of certain drugs complicates equitable allocation, and the concentration of pharmaceutical power in Western, industrialized countries promotes research and drug discovery disproportionately for diseases that are prevalent in the wealthier nations. The increasing sophistication of drug action challenges the traditional model of using drugs as a means to treat pathological conditions and processes, and raises the specter of lifestyle and enhancement uses of pharmaceuticals. New means of drug discovery \u2013 such as the use of stem cells \u2013 have elicited debate about the relative values placed on the status of the embryo and the potential treatment for intractable conditions that could result from stem cell research. Finally, the overall emphasis on drugs as the first line defense against what ails us has provoked some societal soul-searching. In this chapter, we review some of the ethical issues attendant to drug production and distribution, including issues of safety, justice, economic inequality, and the changing demands for drugs that exceed therapeutic uses. Suggestions are made to make pharmaceutical companies more responsive to these issues and to make oversight bodies more responsible for their roles.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolpe, P.

R 0 for severe acute respiratory syndrome is generally considered to be \u003E1, whereas that for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is considered to be \u003C1. However, this does not explain the large-scale outbreaks of MERS that occurred in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and South Korean hospitals. Aim : To estimate R 0 in nosocomial outbreaks of MERS. Methods R 0 was estimated using the incidence decay with an exponential adjustment model. The KSA and Korean outbreaks were compared using a line listing of MERS cases compiled using publicly available sources. Serial intervals to estimate R 0 were assumed to be six to eight days. Study parameters [R 0 and countermeasures (d)] were estimated by fitting a model to the cumulative incidence epidemic curves using Matlab. Findings The estimated R 0 in Korea was 3.9 in the best-fit model, with a serial interval of six days. The first outbreak cluster in a hospital in Pyeongtaek had an R 0 of 4.04, and the largest outbreak cluster in a hospital in Samsung had an R 0 of 5.0. Assuming a six-day serial interval, the KSA outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh had R 0 values of 3.9 and 1.9, respectively. Conclusion R 0 for the nosocomial MERS outbreaks in KSA and South Korea was estimated to be in the range of 2\u20135, which is significantly higher than the previous estimate of \u003C1. Therefore, more comprehensive countermeasures are needed to address these infections.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, S.; Jung, E.; Choi, B. Y.; Hur, Y.

In this study, we sought to use this signal transduction conduit against them by inhibiting multiple kinases that influence translation. Previous work indicated that several kinases involved in translation, including p70 S6K, p90RSK, ERK, and p38 MAPK, are phosphorylated following Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. Furthermore, inhibiting p70 S6K through treatment with the FDA approved drug rapamycin prevents RVFV pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. We hypothesized that inhibiting either p70 S6K, p90RSK, or p90RSK\u2019s upstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK, would decrease translation and subsequent viral replication. Treatment with the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of translational proteins and reduced RVFV titers. In contrast, treatment with the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870, p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 alone had minimal influence on RVFV titers. The combination of PF-4708671 and BI-D1870 treatment resulted in robust inhibition of RVFV replication. Likewise, a synergistic inhibition of RVFV replication was observed with p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 combined with rapamycin treatment. These findings serve as a proof of concept regarding combination kinase inhibitor treatment for RVFV infection.","publish_time":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bell, Todd M.; Espina, Virginia; Lundberg, Lindsay; Pinkham, Chelsea; Brahms, Ashwini; Carey, Brian D.; Lin, Shih-Chao; Dahal, Bibha; Woodson, Caitlin; de la Fuente, Cynthia; Liotta, Lance A.; Bailey, Charles L.; Kehn-Hall, Kylene","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/369914e87f682579eb3a5efeb43dc0184a88b5d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923485.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652799/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10040191","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley","FDA","RVFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVFV infection","ERK inhibitor PD0325901","p70 S6K inhibitor PF","combination kinase inhibitor treatment","RVFV pathogenesis","rapamycin treatment","p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870","p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580","BI-D1870 treatment","reduced RVFV titers","robust inhibition of RVFV replication","synergistic inhibition of RVFV replication","p38 MAPK","combination of PF","multiple kinases","subsequent viral replication","s upstream kinases","mouse model of infection","decreased phosphorylation of translational proteins","minimal influence","viral progeny","FDA approved drug rapamycin","host cell translational machinery","order","following Rift Valley fever virus","proof of concept","Viruses","signal transduction conduit","contrast","findings","Previous work","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted active surveillance of community-acquired ALRI in two hospitals in Cambodia, a low-income tropical country. Patients were tested for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) by direct sputum examination, other bacteria by blood and/or sputum cultures, and respiratory viruses using molecular techniques on nasopharyngeal/throat swabs. Pulmonologists reviewed clinical/laboratory data and interpreted chest X-rays (CXR) to confirm ALRI. RESULTS: Between April 2007 - December 2009, 1,904 patients aged \u22655 years were admitted with acute pneumonia (50.4%), lung sequelae-associated ALRI (24.3%), isolated pleural effusions (8.9%) or normal CXR-related ALRI (17.1%); 61 (3.2%) died during hospitalization. The two former diagnoses were predominantly due to bacterial etiologies while viral detection was more frequent in the two latter diagnoses. AFB-positive accounted for 25.6% of acute pneumonia. Of the positive cultures (16.8%), abscess-prone Gram-negative bacteria (39.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (38.0%) were most frequent, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.7%). Of the identified viruses, the three most common viruses included rhinoviruses (49.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (17.7%) and influenza viruses (12.1%) regardless of the diagnostic groups. Wheezing was associated with viral identification (31.9% vs. 13.8%, p \u003C 0.001) independent of age and time-to-admission. CONCLUSIONS: High frequency of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae infections support the need for introduction of the respective vaccines in the national immunization program. Tuberculosis was frequent in patients with acute pneumonia, requiring further investigation. The relationship between respiratory viruses and wheezing merits further studies.","publish_time":"2013-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vong, Sirenda; Guillard, Bertrand; Borand, Laurence; Rammaert, Blandine; Goyet, Sophie; Te, Vantha; Lorn Try, Patrich; Hem, Sopheak; Rith, Sareth; Ly, Sowath; Cavailler, Philippe; Mayaud, Charles; Buchy, Philippe","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99961d71bc4a1764e7b41b1cd26038ef91970d78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3606325.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-97; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23432906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus","Streptococcus pneumoniae","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["ALRI"],"locations":["Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","acute pneumonia","common viruses","influenza viruses","identified viruses","Patients","bacterial etiology of acute lower respiratory infections","normal CXR-related ALRI","lung sequelae-associated ALRI","sputum cultures","pneumoniae infections","respiratory syncytial virus","viral detection","viral identification","positive cultures","diagnoses","AFB-positive accounted","laboratory data","bacterial etiologies","wheezing merits","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus influenzae","direct sputum examination","abscess-prone Gram-negative bacteria","molecular techniques","respective vaccines","interpreted chest X-rays","need","introduction","Cambodia","hospitals","blood","acid-fast bacilli","national immunization program","throat swabs","active surveillance of community","relationship","studies","low-income tropical country","independent of age","High frequency of","time","old persons","tropics","CONCLUSIONS","Pulmonologists","rhinoviruses","years","isolated pleural effusions","admission","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Tuberculosis","investigation","diagnostic groups","RESULTS","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

More recently, it has been shown that bats may also serve as a new and excellent model to study aging, inflammation, and cancer, among other important biological processes. The cave nectar bat or lesser dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) is known to be a reservoir for several viruses and intracellular bacteria. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India to Southeast Asia and pollinates several plant species, including the culturally and economically important durian in the region. Here, we report the whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, followed by subsequent de novo assembly, of the E. spelaea genome solely using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing platform. FINDINGS: The newly assembled E. spelaea genome is 1.97 Gb in length and consists of 4,470 sequences with a contig N50 of 8.0 Mb. Identified repeat elements covered 34.65% of the genome, and 20,640 unique protein-coding genes with 39,526 transcripts were annotated. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the PacBio long-read sequencing platform alone is sufficient to generate a comprehensive de novo assembled genome and transcriptome of an important bat species. These results will provide useful insights and act as a resource to expand our understanding of bat evolution, ecology, physiology, immunology, viral infection, and transmission dynamics.","publish_time":"2018-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Ming; Ng, Justin H J; Zhu, Feng; Chionh, Yok Teng; Chia, Wan Ni; Mendenhall, Ian H; Lee, Benjamin PY-H; Irving, Aaron T; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"Gigascience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dad9bd8517d4636b9f8c0ff4be2ebde35cd7ae4b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d05db1671aad976139c50f5c4e8ecdc4c6811bde.json; document_parses/pdf_json/49622da5387138eec1a679a582f89ead9f99fcde.json; document_parses/pdf_json/628791ab32e8dc2a3e032fdd76f507da5f9ef04b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6177735.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30247613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pacific Biosciences"],"locations":["India","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["spelaea genome","important bat species","novo assembled genome","transcriptome sequencing","important durian","sequencing platform","important model system","lesser dawn bat","cave nectar bat","understanding of bat evolution","Eonycteris spelaea","PacBio","important biological processes","bats","excellent model","novo assembly","study aging","plant species","immunology","ecology","physiology","cancer","viral infection","Southeast Asia","resource","inflammation","unique protein-coding genes","useful insights","subtropics","India","host-pathogen interactions","length","Pacific Biosciences","Gb","transmission dynamics","contig N50","reservoir","viruses","intracellular bacteria","sequences","results","transcripts","decades","BACKGROUND","region","FINDINGS","repeat elements","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV during intubation from laboratory confirmed SARS patients to HCWs involved in their care. All SARS patients requiring intubation during the Toronto outbreak were identified. All HCWs who provided care to intubated SARS patients during treatment or transportation and who entered a patient room or had direct patient contact from 24 hours before to 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study. Data was collected on patients by chart review and on HCWs by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to identify risk factors for SARS transmission. RESULTS: 45 laboratory-confirmed intubated SARS patients were identified. Of the 697 HCWs involved in their care, 624 (90%) participated in the study. SARS-CoV was transmitted to 26 HCWs from 7 patients; 21 HCWs were infected by 3 patients. In multivariate GEE logistic regression models, presence in the room during fiberoptic intubation (OR = 2.79, p = .004) or ECG (OR = 3.52, p = .002), unprotected eye contact with secretions (OR = 7.34, p = .001), patient APACHE II score \u226520 (OR = 17.05, p = .009) and patient Pa0(2)/Fi0(2) ratio \u226459 (OR = 8.65, p = .001) were associated with increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV. In CART analyses, the four covariates which explained the greatest amount of variation in SARS-CoV transmission were covariates representing individual patients. CONCLUSION: Close contact with the airway of severely ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secretions were associated with transmission of SARS-CoV. Rates of transmission of SARS-CoV varied widely among patients.","publish_time":"2010-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raboud, Janet; Shigayeva, Altynay; McGeer, Allison; Bontovics, Erika; Chapman, Martin; Gravel, Denise; Henry, Bonnie; Lapinsky, Stephen; Loeb, Mark; McDonald, L.

A MERS patient came from Korea to China in late May 2015. The patient was 44 years old and had symptoms including high fever, dry cough with a little phlegm, and shortness of breath, which are roughly consistent with those associated with MERS, and had had close contact with individuals with confirmed cases of MERS.After one month of therapy with antiviral, anti-infection, and immune-enhancing agents, the patient recovered in the hospital and was discharged. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for direct sequencing, which revealed two deletion variants of MERS CoV. Deletions of 414 and 419 nt occurred between ORF5 and the E protein, resulting in a partial protein fusion or truncation of ORF5 and the E protein. Functional analysis by bioinformatics and comparison to previous studies implied that the two variants might be defective in their ability to package MERS CoV.

Research suggests a non-chance association between EV infections and type 1 diabetes. Immunohistochemical studies with the anti-EV antibody 5D-8.1 have shown that the EV capsid antigen is present in pancreatic islet cells of diabetic subjects. When it was noticed that 5D-8.1 may cross-react with human proteins, doubt was casted on the significance of the above histopathologic findings. To address this issue, properties of EV antibodies 5D-8.1 and 9D5 have been investigated using peptide microarrays, peptide substitution scanning, immunofluorescence of EV-infected cells, EV neutralization assays, bioinformatics analysis. Evidence indicates that the two antibodies bind to distinct non-neutralizing linear epitopes in VP1 and are specific for a vast spectrum of EV types (not for other human viruses). However, their epitopes may align with a few human proteins at low expected values. When tested by immunofluorescence, high concentrations of 5D-8.1 yelded faint cytoplasmic staining in uninfected cells. At reduced concentrations, both antibodies produced dotted staining only in the cytoplasm of infected cells and recognized both acute and persistent EV infection. Thus, the two monoclonals represent distinct and independent probes for hunting EVs in tissues of patients with diabetes or other endocrine conditions.","publish_time":"2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maccari, Giuseppe; Genoni, Angelo; Sansonno, Silvia; Toniolo, Antonio","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3988daa8f0fb161f00ae4b0260db05ead0cbfdbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4835795.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunofluorescence of EV","EV infections","properties of EV antibodies","EV neutralization assays","EV capsid antigen","anti-EV antibody","persistent EV infection","vast spectrum of EV types","human proteins","uninfected cells","human viruses","Human enteroviruses","cytoplasm of infected cells","diabetes","pancreatic islet cells of diabetic subjects","distinct non-neutralizing linear epitopes","hunting EVs","peptide microarrays","dotted staining","reduced concentrations","high concentrations","different types","peptide substitution scanning","non-chance association","yelded faint cytoplasmic staining","VP1","tissues of patients","independent probes","bioinformatics analysis","significance","Immunohistochemical studies","doubt","low expected values","9D5","endocrine conditions","monoclonals","Research","histopathologic findings","Evidence"],"language":"en"},

In the case of the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), several studies have shown coronavirus diversity in bats as well as the existence of SARS-CoV infection in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease. To elucidate the biogeographic origin of SARS-CoV and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence, we amplified coronavirus sequences from bat species captured throughout Thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published coronavirus sequences. To this end, RdRp sequence of Coronavirinae was targeted by RT-PCR in non-invasive samples from bats collected in Thailand. Two new coronaviruses were detected in two bat species: one Betacoronavirus in Hipposideros larvatus and one Alphacoronavirus in Hipposideros armiger. Interestingly, these viruses from South-East Asia are related to those previously detected in Africa (Betacoronavirus-b) or in Europe (Alphacoronavirus \u0026 Betacoronavirus-b). These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human. All reported Betacoronaviruses-b (SARS-CoV group) of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sympatry of their hosts, which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of Betacoronavirus-b clusters in these families. Moreover, despite its probable pathogenicity, we found that a Betacoronavirus-b can persistently infect a medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony. These findings illustrate the importance of the host phylogeny and the host/pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence. The host\u2019s phylogeny, biogeography and behaviour, combined with already described roles of pathogen plasticity and anthropic changes are likely to be co-factors of disease emergence. Elucidating the common ancestor of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae is key to understanding the evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses and therefore to get an insight of the deep origin of SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2011-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gouilh, Meriadeg Ar; Puechmaille, S\u00E9bastien J.; Gonzalez, Jean-Paul; Teeling, Emma; Kittayapong, Pattamaporn; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/888df3a1646290458e16ab2ad3add5ef41b02ecc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106191.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.06.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134811002346; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811002346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21763784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae"],"locations":["Thailand","Hipposideros","South-East Asia","Africa","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Betacoronavirus-b","SARS-CoV group","Rhinolophidae","existence of SARS","CoV infection","Betacoronavirus spill","healthy bats","deep origin of SARS","biogeographic origin of SARS","understanding of pathogen emergence","b clusters","independent evolution of Betacoronavirus","reported Betacoronaviruses-b","emergence of new pathogens","host phylogeny","bat species","coronavirus diversity","published coronavirus sequences","co-factors of disease emergence","emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Alphacoronavirus","crucial host","Thailand","hosts","findings","evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses","roles of pathogen plasticity","pathogen ecological interactions","common ancestor of Hipposideridae","Hipposideros larvatus","Hipposideros armiger","host\u2019s phylogeny","new coronaviruses","medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony","anthropic changes","description","RT-PCR","groups","non-invasive samples","broad geographic distribution","studies","Europe","great challenges","RdRp sequence of Coronavirinae","behaviour","sympatry","insight","ecology of infectious diseases","biogeography","favor","case","genesis","importance","civets","families","hypothesis","phylogenetic relationships","South-East Asia","Human","Africa","probable pathogenicity"],"language":"en"},

We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay\u2019s clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency.

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), III (D). Alanine substitution of the motif I residues (AA-E-D, four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low passage (P10) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multi-protein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. Coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside of ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.","publish_time":"2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graepel, Kevin W.; Agostini, Maria L.; Lu, Xiaotao; Sexton, Nicole R.; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e96c20fdbf8c7ca4b79ea9f8aa3ee06f7988f8b9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d82fe700418fb6494ffb9a2c0cf4f6b8012b3824.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/618249","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ExoN-AA reversion","ExoN-AA motif","MHV-ExoN","reverted ExoN","nsp14-ExoN","stabilization of ExoN","lack of ExoN","defective ExoN","presence of ExoN","engineered reversion of ExoN","AA-E","genetic stability of ExoN","SARS-CoV ExoN motif","stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants","ExoN catalytic residues","AA coronavirus mutants","AA passage-adaptive mutations","reversion detrimental","partial reversion","competitive fitness","increased replication","nucleotide mutations","impaired replication","viral replication","profound fitness barriers","viable mutants","significant fitness loss","genome replication","results","coronavirus replicase proteins","inactivating mutations","compensatory mutations","coevolution","long-term passage","evolutionary relationships","low passage","evolutionary basis","attenuated virulence","evolutionary rationale","genetic background","genetic pathways","Coronaviruses","intermediate revertants","exoribonuclease","potential multi-protein replicase interactions","increased mutation rates","potential mechanisms","nonstructural protein","nucleotide substitutions","virus inhospitable","murine hepatitis virus","alternative adaptive pathway","diverse experimental conditions","future studies","P10","RNA proofreading","multiple impediments","environments","contrast","Alanine substitution","study","motifs","impairments","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

In total, 3,742,314 reads of 114 bases were generated, and over 86% were assembled into 1,649,512 contigs with an average length of 114 bp, of which 26,698 (2%) contigs were recognizable viral sequences belonging to 24 viral families. Of the viral contigs 45% (12,086/26,698) were related to vertebrate viruses, 28% (7,443/26,698) to insect viruses, 27% (7,074/26,698) to phages and 95 contigs to plant viruses. The metagenomic results were confirmed by PCR of selected viruses in all bat samples followed by phylogenetic analysis, which has led to the discovery of some novel bat viruses of the genera Mamastrovirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, Iflavirus and Orthohepadnavirus and to their prevalence rates in two bat species.

However, the detailed catalytic mechanism of coronavirus 3CL(Pro) remains largely unknown. We took an integrated approach of employing X-ray crystallography, mutational studies, enzyme kinetics study, and inhibitors to gain insights into the mechanism. Such experimental work is supplemented by computational studies, including the prereaction state analysis, the ab initio calculation of the critical catalytic step, and the molecular dynamic simulation of the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Taken together, such studies allowed us to identify a residue pair (Glu-His) and a conserved His as critical for binding; a conserved GSCGS motif as important for the start of catalysis, a partial negative charge cluster (PNCC) formed by Arg-Tyr-Asp as essential for catalysis, and a conserved water molecule mediating the remote interaction between PNCC and catalytic dyad. The data collected and our insights into the detailed mechanism have allowed us to achieve a good understanding of the difference in catalytic efficiency between 3CL(Pro) from SARS and MERS, conduct mutational studies to improve the catalytic activity by 8-fold, optimize existing inhibitors to improve the potency by 4-fold, and identify a potential allosteric site for inhibitor design.

Though extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) provides a noninvasive treatment option, controversial subjects still exist about its effectiveness, indications, and mechanism of action. METHODS: An electronic databases search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to collect clinical trials, case reports, and cases series on this topic and then useful data were extracted and appraised by experienced clinicians. We evaluated the quality of included evidences by using the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine (EBM) Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: A total of 17 articles including 2 case reports, 9 open label trials, 2 cohorts, and 6 randomized controlled trials were considered to be eligible for this systematic review. Visual analog scale (VAS), Harris hip scores, and the imaging results were the frequently-used outcome estimates of included studies. CONCLUSION: By systematically analyzing these evidences, we could conclude that ESWT could act as a safe and effective method to improve the motor function and relieve the pain of patients with osteonecrosis of femoral hip, especially those at early stage. Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved, but the necrotic bone could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery. Collaboration with other conservative modalities would not improve the curative benefits of ESWT. Meanwhile, ONFH with various risk factors showed similar reaction to this noninvasive treatment method. However, these conclusions should be interpreted carefully for the low-quality of included publications and further studies are requisite to validate the effect of ESWT in ONFH.","publish_time":"2017-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qingyu; Liu, Lihua; Sun, Wei; Gao, Fuqiang; Cheng, Liming; Li, Zirong","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb59a75042a0be5861524532178e8becd8cda233.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5287958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28121934/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000005897","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Osteonecrosis","Harris"],"organizations":["ESWT","ONFH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of ESWT","curative benefits of ESWT","case reports","clinical trials","noninvasive treatment method","imaging results","quality of included evidences","progression of ONFH","outcome estimates of included studies","open label trials","noninvasive treatment option","osteonecrosis of femoral hip","randomized controlled trials","low-quality of included publications","Levels of Evidence","effective method","necrotic bone","Harris hip scores","evidence-based medicine","bone marrow edema","similar reaction","cohorts","Oxford Centre","various risk factors","PubMed","incapacitating disorder","pain of patients","EBM","controversial subjects","Cochrane library","cases series","motor function","electronic databases search","effectiveness","topic","Embase","Visual analog scale","articles","conservative modalities","high morbidity","extracorporeal shockwave therapy","indications","useful data","METHODS","BACKGROUND","total","mechanism of action","early stage","systematic review","Collaboration","demand","experienced clinicians","surgery","technique","conclusions"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a molecular and seroepidemiologic investigation to describe the deletion variant\u2019s transmission patterns and epidemiology. METHODS: We reviewed epidemiologic and medical chart data and analyzed viral genome sequences from respiratory specimens of MERS-CoV cases. In early 2016, sera and standardized interviews were obtained from MERS-CoV cases and their contacts. Sera were evaluated by nucleocapsid and spike protein enzyme immunoassays and microneutralization. RESULTS: Among 16 cases, 11 (69%) had health care exposure and 5 (31%) were relatives of a known case; 13 (81%) were symptomatic, and 7 (44%) died. Genome sequencing of MERS-CoV from 13 cases revealed 3 transmissible deletions associated with clinical illness during the outbreak. Deletion variant sequences were epidemiologically clustered and linked to a common transmission chain. Interviews and sera were collected from 2 surviving cases, 23 household contacts, and 278 health care contacts; 1 (50%) case, 2 (9%) household contacts, and 3 (1%) health care contacts tested seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: The MERS-CoV deletion variants retained human-to-human transmissibility and caused clinical illness in infected persons despite accumulated mutations. Serology suggested limited transmission beyond that detected during the initial outbreak investigation.","publish_time":"2018-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payne, Daniel C; Biggs, Holly M; Al-Abdallat, Mohammad Mousa; Alqasrawi, Sultan; Lu, Xiaoyan; Abedi, Glen R; Haddadin, Aktham; Iblan, Ibrahim; Alsanouri, Tarek; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Sheikh Ali, Sami; Rha, Brian; Trivedi, Suvang U; Rasheed, Mohammed Ata Ur; Tamin, Azaibi; Lamers, Mart M; Haagmans, Bart L; Erdman, Dean D; Thornburg, Natalie J; Gerber, Susan I","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa4407c76e151d9a802720724d5604436d44e68b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5965092.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofy095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30294616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV cases","health care contacts","MERS-CoV deletion variants","household contacts","surviving cases","sera","respiratory specimens of MERS","Genome sequencing of MERS","Deletion variant sequences","health care exposure","clinical illness","deletion variant\u2019s transmission patterns","initial outbreak investigation","limited transmission","viral genome sequences","common transmission chain","outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","distinctive deletions","transmissible deletions","human transmissibility","variant virus","seroepidemiologic investigation","standardized interviews","known case","medical chart data","infected persons","spike protein enzyme immunoassays","nucleocapsid","accessory open reading frames","accumulated mutations","microneutralization","epidemiology","Jordan","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","relatives","Serology","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This article summarizes the principal invited lectures at the meeting. The opening symposium on the legacy of the late Anton\u00EDn Hol\u00FD included presentations on his pioneering work with nucleotide analogs, which led to the development of several antiviral drugs including tenofovir. This drug has transformed the treatment of HIV infection and has recently become the first-line therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The Gertrude Elion Award lecturer described the anti-HIV activities of the CCR5 inhibitor cenicriviroc and the reverse transcriptase inhibitor festinavir\u00AE, and also reviewed the evaluation of biodegradable nanoparticles with adjuvant activity. The William Prusoff Award winner reported on the creation of NAOMI, a computer model with 21 enzymes to predict the activity of nucleoside analogs against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Other invited lecturers discussed the development of countermeasures against severe dengue and the potential of RNA virus capping and repair enzymes as drug targets. Topics in the clinical symposium included the current status of the anti-HCV compounds sovaprevir, ACH-3102, miravirsen and ALS-2200; the evaluation of single-tablet regimens for HIV infection; and the investigation of cytomegalovirus resistance to CMX001. Two chemistry minisymposia examined strategies and tactics in drug design and the use of in drug discovery.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vere Hodge, R.

Methods A community telephone survey was conducted with 230 Chinese adolescents. Random-digit dialing of the local residential telephone directory was used to select respondents, who were asked to provide information on their practice of SARS preventive health behaviors and associated factors as specified by the Health Belief Model. These factors included perceived threat of SARS, perceived benefits and barriers in practicing SARS preventive health behaviors, cues to action, knowledge of SARS, and self-efficacy. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine salient correlates of habitual and volitional health behaviors against SARS. Results About 54.8% of respondents reported practicing all three recommended habitual health behaviors. Another 47.8% indicated consistent practice of volitional health behavior of facemask-wearing to prevent SARS. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that habitual health behaviors against SARS were related to perceived health threat and environmental cues. For facemask-wearing, salient correlates were environmental cues, rates of SARS habitual health behaviors, younger age, and perceived health threat. Conclusions The Health Belief Model is useful in understanding Chinese adolescents\u2019 practice of health behaviors, especially volitional health behaviors.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Chi-Yan; Tang, Catherine So-Kum","journal":"Journal of Adolescent Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53f7ce0a18de7792f478273f9449e175960563c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129542.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X04002253; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054139X04002253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["volitional health behaviors","rates of SARS habitual health behaviors","practice of SARS preventive health behaviors","recommended habitual health behaviors","practicing SARS preventive health behaviors","perceived health threat","Chinese adolescents\u2019 practice of health behaviors","Health Belief Model","perceived threat of SARS","knowledge of SARS","practice of habitual","consistent practice of volitional health behavior of facemask","salient correlates of habitual","perceived benefits","environmental cues","associated factors","Results of hierarchical regression analyses","respondents","community telephone survey","local residential telephone directory","barriers","younger age","severe acute respiratory syndrome","action","Conclusions","Hong Kong","Random-digit","Methods","self-efficacy","information","Abstract Purpose"],"language":"en"},

Smallpox probably reached Europe from Asia in the 5th century, and yellow fever emerged in the Americas during the 16th century as a consequence of the African slave trade. Dengue fever arose simultaneously in South-East Asia, Africa, and North America during the 18th century. In 1918\u20131919 the so-called Spanish \u2018flu spread like wildfire through all five continents, killing between 25 and 40 million people. The second half of the 20th century saw the emergence of HIV/AIDS (1981), among other viral diseases. Even more worrying is the fact that emerging and re-emerging viral diseases have had a tendency to spread more quickly and more widely during the last decade, invading whole countries and continents; witness the recent outbreaks of Nipah virus, West Nile, Rift Valley fever, SARS, monkeypox, avianflu (H5N1) and Chikungunya.

The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive designs were used. A non-probability purposive sampling method was used to select the participants. The personal experiences of six nurses with more than five years\u2019 experience caring for TB patients at a regional hospital were explored, and it was guided by data saturation. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi\u2019s method. Trustworthiness was ensured and ethical considerations were observed in this study. The research findings revealed six major themes from the raw data: challenges of the working environment, problems impacting on the quality of nursing care, fear, anxiety, stress and risk of contracting infection, nurses\u2019 perceptions towards patients, support structure available in the hospital, and support needs for the nurses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the challenges experienced by nurses caring for communicable diseases through provision of a positive practice work environment.","publish_time":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matakanye, Hulisani; Ramathuba, Dorah U.; Tugli, Augustine K.","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06f8316b5b1cd5f0737d5ada43c3dd9ebce27a91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6949926.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16244977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Africa","South Africa"],"keyphrases":["TB patients","experiences of nurses","regional hospital","raw data","data saturation","challenges","study","major cause of illness","major themes","rod-shaped pathogen","working environment","curable illness","support needs","single pathogen","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","South Africa","Colaizzi\u2019s method","personal experiences","non-probability purposive sampling method","support structure available","positive practice work environment","nurses\u2019 perceptions","provision","risk of contracting infection","fear","anxiety","stress","Limpopo Province","quality of nursing care","problems","communicable diseases","world","death","biggest killer","tragedy","years\u2019 experience","descriptive designs","ethical considerations","research findings","in-depth individual interviews","fact","Trustworthiness","Asia","urgent need","aim","participants"],"language":"en"},

In 1992, the concentration was raised to 100IU FVIII/mL in the reconstituted product, with a mean specific activity of 270IU/mg protein. Pathogen safety is achieved by careful donor selection and a combination of pasteurization and chromatographic purification steps. Materials and methods We analysed the efficacy and safety of Beriate\u00AE P in the clinical setting from 1996 to 2005 with a focus on surgical patients. Of the 36 patients (mean age: 38years; range 1\u201372years), 29 had severe haemophilia A, two had moderate haemophilia, two had mild haemophilia, and three had sub-clinical haemophilia. Most patients (n=28) had more than 100 exposure days, representing a total of 202 patient-years with a consumption of 27,811,500IU of Beriate\u00AE P. Results There was no evidence of seroconversion towards relevant viruses, no inhibitor development (35 previously treated patients, one previously untreated patient), no abnormal immunological findings or allergic reactions. In all 36 patients treated for acute bleeding and prophylaxis, and 24 surgeries (15 total joint replacements, eight orthopaedic procedures, one cholecystectomy) in 16 patients with severe haemophilia A, efficacy of Beriate\u00AE P was always rated as \u201Cexcellent\u201D or \u201Cgood\u201D, and no thrombosis was reported. Conclusion Beriate\u00AE P has an excellent efficacy and safety profile.

Acute PEDV outbreaks have continually emerged in most swine-producing Asian countries and, recently, in the United States, causing significant economic losses in the pig industry. The spike (S) protein of PEDV is a type 1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein and consists of the S1 and S2 domains, which are responsible for virus binding and fusion, respectively. Since the S1 domain is involved in a specific high-affinity interaction with the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibody in the natural host, it is a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV. In this study, a codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene containing amino acid residues 25\u2013738 was synthesized based on a multiple alignment of the S amino acid sequences of PEDV field isolates and used to establish a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the PEDV S1 protein. The purified recombinant S1 protein was found to mediate highly potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits. The antibodies strongly recognized the recombinant S1 protein from cell lysates and supernatants of S1-expressing cells, whereas they bound weakly to the authentic S protein of PEDV vaccine strain SM98-1. Furthermore, a serum neutralization test revealed that the rabbit antisera completely inhibit infection of the PEDV vaccine strain at a serum dilution of 1:16. We then tested the ability of vaccination with the recombinant S1 protein to protect piglets against PEDV. Late-term pregnant sows were inoculated intramuscularly with the purified S1 protein, and the outcome was investigated in passively immunized suckling piglets after a virulent PEDV challenge. The results showed that vaccination with S1 protein efficiently protected neonatal piglets against PEDV. Our data suggest that the recombinant S1 protein shows potential as an effective and safe subunit vaccine for PED prevention.","publish_time":"2014-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Jongsuk; Lee, Kyung-Won; Choi, Hwan-Won; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adfa249f4dceff2bd5b326cadeb80a9d330e1cd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086977.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008896/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2163-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["PEDV S1 protein","purified S1 protein","purified recombinant S1 protein","supernatants of S1","S1 domain","codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene","virulent PEDV challenge","Acute PEDV outbreaks","authentic S protein of PEDV vaccine strain SM98","S amino acid sequences of PEDV field isolates","immunized suckling piglets","neonatal piglets","amino acid residues","safe subunit vaccine","cell lysates","stable porcine cell line","immunized rabbits","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","virus binding","serum dilution","ability of vaccination","induction of neutralizing antibody","development of effective vaccines","potent antibody responses","serum neutralization test","contagious enteric pathogen of swine","cellular receptor","significant economic losses","specific high-affinity interaction","natural host","primary target","rabbit antisera","infection","type","outcome","PED prevention","multiple alignment","transmembrane envelope glycoprotein","United States","pig industry","S2 domains","Late-term pregnant sows","fusion","study","results","spike","antibodies","data","Asian countries","cells"],"language":"en"},

Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease. However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV). rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses. Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors. In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls. Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction. We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6-vaccination in neonatal mice. The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate. We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period. Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart. All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6-vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice.","publish_time":"2011-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arnett, Andrea L.

However, little is known about the prevalence or genetic diversity of porcine orthoreoviruses in South Korea. We examined 237 diarrheic fecal samples collected from 78 pig farms around the country. RT-PCR utilizing primers specific for the L1 gene of mammalian orthoreoviruses showed that 45 (19.0%) samples were positive. The 10 strains isolated from orthoreovirus-positive samples formed typical perinuclear cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and had an atypical hemagglutination pattern; these are characteristics of type 3 orthoreovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene in these 10 Korean and other strains showed that type 3 orthoreoviruses could be divided into four lineages; the 10 Korean strains were included in porcine lineage IV, along with T3/porcine/Sichuan/2006. Sequence analysis showed that strains in lineage IV had nucleotide identities of 97.0\u201398.1% and deduced amino acid identities of 96.4\u201398.2%. Sequence analysis of the \u03C31 protein, a viral attachment protein, revealed that the amino acid sequences associated with neurotropism (amino acids 198\u2013204, 249I, 350D, and 419E) were highly conserved among the Korean strains, confirming that neural tropism was present. In conclusion, our findings suggest that porcine orthoreovirus infections are endemic in pig farms in South Korea and that the 10 novel Korean porcine orthoreoviruses belong to porcine lineage IV of type 3 orthoreovirus.

Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines? Herein, we address these timely questions and project considerations during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindsley, Andrew W.; Schwartz, Justin T.; Rothenberg, Marc E.","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec85e354a9dde1350c59fb5cd9e7338d7eb023ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920305698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344056/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920305698?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging COVID","unique COVID","key COVID","altered course of COVID","causative agent of COVID","Abstract Eosinophils","number of diseases","eosinopenia","eosinophilia-associated diseases","patients","acute respiratory deterioration","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","related questions","timely questions","Eosinophil levels","disease course","number of clinical settings","eosinophil-targeted therapy","SARS","infection","potent pro-inflammatory effects","answers","tissue-resident leukocytes","project considerations","Corona Virus","recommended prevention","functions","immunoregulation","susceptibility","biological drugs","antiviral activity","care","lung pathology","relevant question","variety","immunopotentiation","vaccines","pandemic","cells"],"language":"en"},

Novel treatments that can induce a protective immune response are urgently needed to effectively control the HBV epidemic and eventually eradicate chronic HBV infection. METHODS: We designed and evaluated an HBV therapeutic vaccine consisting of a novel Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist T7-EA, an Alum adjuvant and a recombinant HBsAg protein. We used RNA-seq, ELISA and hTLR7/8 reporting assays to characterize T7-EA in vitro and real-time PCR to evaluate the tissue-retention characteristics in vivo. To evaluate the adjuvant potential, we administrated T7-EA intraperitoneally in a formulation with an Alum adjuvant and HBsAg in normal and HBV mice, then, we evaluated the HBsAg-specific immune responses by ELISA and Elispot assays. RESULTS: T7-EA acted as an hTLR7-specific agonist and induced a similar gene expression pattern as an unmodified TLR7 ligand when Raw 264.7 cells were exposed to T7-EA; however, T7-EA was more potent than the unmodified TLR7 ligand. In vivo studies showed that T7-EA had tissue-retaining activity with stimulating local cytokine and chemokine expression for up to 7 days. T7-EA could induce Th1-type immune responses, as evidenced by an increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer and a T-cell response in normal mice compared to mice received traditional Alum-adjuvant HBV vaccine. Importantly, T7-EA could break immune tolerance and induce persistent HBsAg-specific antibody and T-cell responses in an HBV mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: T7-EA might be a candidate adjuvant in a prophylactic and therapeutic HBV vaccine.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Yunlong; Tang, Li; Zhu, Zhengyu; Meng, He; Chen, Tingting; Zhao, Sheng; Jin, Zhenchao; Wang, Zhulin; Jin, Guangyi","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a67536cd819cdbd860efe4a755233eb8eaa770b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7055022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32131853/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02275-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["agonist T7-EA","HBV mice","HBV epidemic","HBV therapeutic vaccine","therapeutic HBV vaccine","HBsAg-specific immune responses","Alum adjuvant","traditional Alum-adjuvant HBV vaccine","chronic HBV infection","HBV mouse model","candidate adjuvant","adjuvant potential","persistent HBsAg-specific antibody","hTLR7-specific agonist","normal mice","immune tolerance","increased HBsAg-specific IgG2a titer","T-cell responses","unmodified TLR7 ligand","recombinant HBsAg protein","protective immune response","Th1-type immune responses","ELISA","chemokine expression","Elispot assays","reporting assays","novel Toll","Novel treatments","tissue-retention characteristics","similar gene expression pattern","global burden of hepatitis B virus","activity","stimulating local cytokine","cells","terms of morbidity","receptor","formulation","real-time PCR","mortality","BACKGROUND","RNA-seq","days","RESULTS","studies","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

There are also at least two other sexually transmitted viruses, for which no vaccine is available, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Traditional textbook explanatory paradigm of rapid mutation of retroviruses cannot adequately address the unavailability of vaccine for many sexually transmissible viruses, since HSV and HCV are DNA and non-retroviral RNA viruses, respectively, whereas effective vaccine for the horsefly-transmitted retroviral cousin of HIV, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), was found in 1973. We reported earlier the highly disordered nature of proteins in outer shells of the HIV, HCV, and HSV. Such levels of disorder are completely absent among the classical viruses, such as smallpox, rabies, yellow fever, and polio viruses, for which efficient vaccines were discovered. This review analyzes the physiology and shell disorder of the various related and non-related viruses to argue that EIAV and the classical viruses need harder shells to survive during harsher conditions of non-sexual transmissions, thus making them vulnerable to antibody detection and neutralization. In contrast, the outer shell of the HIV-1 (with its preferential sexual transmission) is highly disordered, thereby allowing large scale motions of its surface glycoproteins and making it difficult for antibodies to bind to them. The theoretical underpinning of this concept is retrospectively traced to a classical 1920s experiment by the legendary scientist, Oswald Avery. This concept of viral shapeshifting has implications for improved treatment of cancer and infections via immune evasion.","publish_time":"2019-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

At the same time, secretions of the testis, including androgens, influence the development and mature functions of the immune system. Activation of the immune system has negative effects on both androgen and sperm production, so that systemic or local infection and inflammation compromise male fertility.

METHODS: With the help of the principles of the German philosopher Kant, the thinking and planning is framed. RESULTS: The modelling by the researchers of the Imperial College, London, make an oversized second wave in autumn/winter 2020 most likely, if the current countermeasures are kept in place for too long. A timely relaxation of the measures is warranted to allow a staggered attack by the virus onto the population (German: \u201CDurchseuchung\u201D) before the next influenza season 2020/2021 without overburdening the health care infrastructure especially the respiratory care bed capacity. The tempting perspective of a vaccine available before the second wave in autumn, should not lead to any delay in the intermittent relaxation of the countermeasures.

We used spherical gold nanoparticles (average diameter, 15 nm) as a platform for the antigen for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The literature data demonstrate that immunization of animals with the TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles (GNPs) not only activates antigen-presenting cells but also increases the proliferative activity of splenic lymphoid (antibody-forming) cells. The contents of \u03B3-IFN, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates were found to be higher than those in intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone. The increased concentration of IL-1\u03B2 in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated. The increased concentration of IL-6 indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity. Immunization with the TGEV antigen conjugated to GNPs as a carrier activates the respiratory activity of lymphoid cells and peritoneal macrophages, which is directly related to their transforming activity and to the activation of antibody generation. Furthermore, the use of this conjugate allows marked improvement of the structure of the animals\u2019 immune organs and restores the morphological\u2013functional state of these organs. The microanatomical changes (increased number of follicles) indicate the activation of the B-dependent zone of the spleen and, consequently, the development of a humoral-type immunological reaction. The degradative processes observed in the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone are evidence of weak resistance to pathogen attack.

A striking example is the recurrent outbreaks that have been occurring in seabirds on Amsterdam Island for the past 30 years, threatening populations of three Endangered seabird species and of the endemic, Critically Endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis. The bacteria Pasteurella multocida (avian cholera causative agent), and to a lesser extent Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (erysipelas causative agent), were both suspected to be responsible for these epidemics. Despite this critical situation, demographic trends were not available for these threatened populations, and the occurrence and characterization of potential causative agents of epizootics remain poorly known. The aims of the current study were to (i) provide an update of population trends for four threatened seabird species monitored on Amsterdam Island, (ii) assess the occurrence of P. multocida, and E. rhusiopathiae in live birds from five species, (iii) search for other infectious agents in these samples and, (iv) isolate and genotype the causative agent(s) of epizooties from dead birds. Our study shows that the demographic situation has worsened substantially in three seabird species during the past decade, with extremely low reproductive success and declining populations for Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses Thalassarche carteri, sooty albatrosses Phoebetria fusca, and northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi. Pasteurella multocida or E. rhusiopathiae were detected by PCR in live birds of all five investigated species, while results were negative for eight additional infectious agents. A single strain of P. multocida was repeatedly cultured from dead birds, while no E. rhusiopathiae could be isolated. These results highlight the significance of P. multocida in this particular eco-epidemiological system as the main agent responsible for epizootics. The study stresses the urgent need to implement mitigation measures to alter the course of avian cholera outbreaks threatening the persistence of seabird populations on Amsterdam Island.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaeger, Audrey; Lebarbenchon, Camille; Bourret, Vincent; Bastien, Matthieu; Lagadec, Erwan; Thiebot, Jean-Baptiste; Boulinier, Thierry; Delord, Karine; Barbraud, Christophe; Marteau, C\u00E9dric; Dellagi, Koussay; Tortosa, Pablo; Weimerskirch, Henri","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e60dc2f814db6256844444e573ea98bc9a9b4a93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5976148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29847561/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Diomedea","Pasteurella"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Amsterdam Island"],"keyphrases":["Endangered seabird species","threatened seabird species","investigated species","Amsterdam Island","conservation of endangered species","threatened populations","persistence of seabird populations","avian cholera causative agent","erysipelas causative agent","threatening populations","live birds","dead birds","bacteria Pasteurella multocida","declining populations","main agent responsible","additional infectious agents","characterization of potential causative agents of epizootics","Endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis","demographic trends","critical situation","occurrence of","demographic situation","results","Infectious diseases","current study","course of avian cholera outbreaks","lesser extent Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae","past decade","recurrent outbreaks","update of population trends","sooty albatrosses Phoebetria fusca","Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses Thalassarche carteri","endemic","low reproductive success","particular eco-epidemiological system","northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi","years","epizooties","mitigation measures","urgent need","seabirds","striking example","significance of","PCR","search","aims","single strain of","samples","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

Site A is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been previously subdivided into the three subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac. The residues that contribute to these sites were localized by sequence analysis of 21 mutants that escaped neutralization or binding by TGEV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and by epitope scanning (PEPSCAN). Site A contains the residues 538, 591, and 543, which are essential in the formation of subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac, respectively. In addition, mar mutant 1B.H6 with residue 586 changed had partially altered both subsite Aa and Ab, indicating that these subsites overlap in residue 586; i.e. this residue also is part of site A. The peptide 537-MKSGYGQPIA-547 represents, at least partially, subsite Ac which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. This site is relevant for diagnosis and could be of interest for protection. Other residues contribute to site B (residues 97 and 144), site C (residues 50 and 51), and site D (residue 385). The location of site D is in agreement with PEPSCAN results. Site C can be represented by the peptide 48-P-P/S-N-S-D/E-52 but is not exposed on the surface of native virus. Its accessibility can be modulated by treatment at pH \u003E11 (at 4\u00B0) and temperatures \u003E45\u00B0.

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a major cause of death among HIV-infected patients. Cryptococcal antigenemia (CrAg\u002B) in the absence of CM can represent early-stage cryptococcosis during which antifungal treatment might improve outcomes. However, patients without meningitis are rarely tested for cryptococcal infection. We evaluated Cryptococcus species as a cause of acute respiratory infection in hospitalized patients in Thailand and evaluated clinical characteristics associated with CrAg\u002B. Methods. We tested banked serum samples from 704 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2013infected and 730 HIV-uninfected patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infection from 2004 through 2009 in 2 rural provinces in Thailand for the presence of CrAg\u002B. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted for CrAg\u002B patients to distinguish meningeal and nonmeningeal cryptococcosis and to identify clinical characteristics associated with CrAg\u002B in patients with and without evidence of CM. Results. CrAg\u002B was found in 92 HIV-infected patients (13.1%); only tuberculosis (19.3%) and rhinovirus (16.5%) were identified more frequently. No HIV-uninfected patients were CrAg\u002B. Of 70 CrAg\u002B patients with medical charts available, 37 (52.9%) had no evidence of past or existing CM at hospitalization; 30 of those patients (42.9% of all CrAg\u002B) had neither past nor existing CM, nor any alternate etiology of infection identified. Dyspnea was more frequent among CrAg\u002B patients without CM than among CrAg\u2013 patients (P = .0002). Conclusions. Cryptococcus species were the most common pathogens detected in HIV-infected patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in Thailand. Few clinical differences were found between antigenemic and nonantigenemic HIV-infected patients.

Recent studies have revealed that several nonstructural proteins encoded by the PRRSV genome independently antagonize the type 1 IFN system. The present study sought to identify the structural proteins that possess the immune evasion properties in immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM). Each structural protein gene was stably expressed in a porcine monocyte-derived macrophage cell line, PAM-pCD163, and tested for its potential to inhibit IFN-\u03B2 induction. We then focused on the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which has a strong inhibitory effect on dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03B2 production. Upon dsRNA stimulation, IFN-\u03B2 production was shown to decrease proportionally with increasing levels of N expression. Furthermore, the PRRSV N protein was found to down-regulate IFN-dependent gene production by dsRNA. Taken together, these results indicate the ability of N to modulate the dsRNA-mediated IFN induction pathways. In addition, the N protein significantly interfered with dsRNA-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Our data suggest that the PRRSV N protein is a responsible component, independent of other nonstructural elements, for evading the IFN response by antagonizing IRF3 activation.","publish_time":"2011-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sagong, Mingeun; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23b41de7e1a2f305de2e2da56ce357d2a168631d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086947.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21947566/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1116-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","PRRSV N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN response","PRRSV N protein","IFN system","dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03B2 production","IFN-\u03B2 induction","IFN-dependent gene production","ability of N","dsRNA-mediated IFN induction pathways","dsRNA stimulation","structural protein gene","dsRNA-induced phosphorylation","PRRSV genome","increasing levels of N expression","type","nonstructural proteins","immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages","weak innate immune response","nonstructural elements","PAM-pCD163","immune evasion properties","porcine monocyte-derived macrophage cell line","nuclear translocation of IRF3","antagonizing IRF3 activation","responsible component","infection","respiratory syndrome virus","interferon","strong inhibitory effect","potential","data","present study","Recent studies","results","nucleocapsid","addition"],"language":"en"},

HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death. Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD. METHODS: In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited. The data was analyzed by time-series fashion. Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA. We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi). RESULTS: The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of severe cases were significantly higher than those mild cases and the increased concentrations of Ang II and NA showed the same time trend during the progression of HFMD in the severe cases. Furthermore, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in target organs of EV71-infected mice including brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs were increased with the progression of EV71 infection in mice.

Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction. The complexity and the crosstalk between these cell death modalities reflect a continuous evolutionary race between pathogens and host. This chapter discusses the current advances in the research of cell death signaling with regard to viral and bacterial infections and describes the network of the cell death initiating molecular mechanisms that selectively recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns.","publish_time":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imre, Gergely","journal":"Int Rev Cell Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b2af34d3c65cc3eda82560616c424a447139709.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102569.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381176/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644819301273; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644819301273; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.12.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["research of cell death","cell death induction","cell death pathways","cell shrinkage","lytic cell death modalities","distinct types of regulated cell death forms","apoptotic cell demise","immune response","molecular patterns","bacterial infections","pyroptosis","necroptosis","immune cells","molecular mechanisms","extracellular bacteria","extracellular space","host","pathogens","distinct immune stimulatory potential","early membrane damage","presence of viral proteins","membrane integrity","destruction of intact extracellular barriers","Abstract Apoptosis","osmotic imbalance","bleb formation","continuous evolutionary race","significant roles","regard","nuclear condensation","routes","network","targeted attack","current advances","crosstalk","caspase","circumstances","anti-inflammatory","relevance","chapter","complexity"],"language":"en"},

The movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is targeted to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Despite a number of functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP has been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Introducing glycine substitutions in these motifs results in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP, but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at PD. Taken together, these data suggest that both Y and LL motifs are indispensable for targeting of OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection, but show differences in functionality. This study provides new insights into the role of sorting motifs in intracellular targeting of MPs and vesicle trafficking pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.","publish_time":"2019-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ozber, Natali; Margaria, Paolo; Anderson, Charles T.; Turina, Massimo; Rosa, Cristina","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d91bba210d98289dac830135c56c13e206837ec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/339fefdab92a64585c200cb5f7baec685178db3d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/724716","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Arabidopsis"],"organizations":["PD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell movement","pathways OuMV MP hijacks","LL motifs","sorting motif mutants","Y motif mutants","correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP","role of sorting motifs","putative sorting motifs","loss of OuMV infectivity","motifs results","Live cell imaging of GFP","movement protein","plant viruses","PD","plasma membrane","TGN","intracellular targeting of MPs","Arabidopsis thaliana","vesicle trafficking pathways","trans-Golgi network","Nicotiana benthamiana","important regions","efficient systemic infection","tyrosine","Ourmia melon virus","new insights","differences","sophisticated endomembrane system","multivesicular body","prevacuolar compartment","plasmodesmata","forms tubules","dileucine","Mutations","glycine substitutions","Plants","study","number","N-terminus","functionality","ability","data","deposits"],"language":"en"},

Absence, or inactivation, of E protein results in attenuated viruses, due to alterations in either virion morphology or tropism. Apart from its morphogenetic properties, protein E has been reported to have membrane permeabilizing activity. Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion channel activity of some synthetic coronavirus E proteins, and also viral replication. We have previously shown for the coronavirus species responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms pentameric \u03B1-helical bundles that are likely responsible for the observed channel activity. Herein, using solution NMR in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles and energy minimization, we have obtained a model of this channel which features regular \u03B1-helices that form a pentameric left-handed parallel bundle. The drug HMA was found to bind inside the lumen of the channel, at both the C-terminal and the N-terminal openings, and, in contrast to amiloride, induced additional chemical shifts in ETM. Full length SARS-CoV E displayed channel activity when transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells in a whole-cell patch clamp set-up. This activity was significantly reduced by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not by amiloride. The channel structure presented herein provides a possible rationale for inhibition, and a platform for future structure-based drug design of this potential pharmacological target.","publish_time":"2009-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pervushin, Konstantin; Tan, Edward; Parthasarathy, Krupakar; Lin, Xin; Jiang, Feng Li; Yu, Dejie; Vararattanavech, Ardcharaporn; Soong, Tuck Wah; Liu, Ding Xiang; Torres, Jaume","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d09827278115fad7feb41c47b6da245f54ba1453.json; document_parses/pdf_json/610adc2e0b9fea5bdaa4ea21b46e4bd6b02d558d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2702000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19593379/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000511","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein E","ion channel activity","observed channel activity","channel structure","E protein results","transmembrane domain of E protein","drug hexamethylene amiloride","drug HMA","length SARS-CoV E","synthetic coronavirus E proteins","membrane permeabilizing activity","\u03B1-helical transmembrane domain","ETM","forms pentameric \u03B1-helical bundles","coronavirus species responsible","regular \u03B1-helices","future structure-based drug design","C-terminal","N-terminal openings","severe acute respiratory syndrome","platform","alterations","energy minimization","dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles","contrast","coronaviruses","attenuated viruses","potential pharmacological target","additional chemical shifts","solution NMR","HEK","inhibition","possible rationale","human embryonic kidney","small polypeptide","inactivation","cell patch clamp set-up","viral replication","virion morphology","tropism","cells","model","morphogenetic properties","envelope","parallel bundle","Absence","lumen"],"language":"en"},

Out of 820 children aged 2\u201359 months with non-severe CAP diagnosed by pediatricians (respiratory complaints and radiographic pulmonary infiltrate/consolidation), recruited in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01200706), nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were obtained from 774 (94.4%) patients and tested for 16 respiratory viruses by PCRs. Results Viruses were detected in 708 (91.5%; 95%CI: 89.3\u201393.3) cases, out of which 491 (69.4%; 95%CI: 65.9\u201372.7) harbored multiple viruses. Rhinovirus (46.1%; 95%CI: 42.6\u201349.6), adenovirus (38.4%; 95%CI: 35.0\u201341.8), and enterovirus (26.5%; 95%CI: 23.5\u201329.7) were the most commonly found viruses. The most frequent combination comprised rhinovirus plus adenovirus. No difference was found in the frequency of RSVA (16.1% vs. 14.6%; P = 0.6), RSVB (10.9% vs. 13.2%; P = 0.4) influenza (Flu) A (6.3% vs. 5.1%; P = 0.5), FluB (4.5% vs. 1.8%; P = 0.09), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1 (5.1% vs. 2.8%; P = 0.2), or PIV4 (7.7% vs. 4.1%; P = 0.08), when children with multiple or sole virus detection were compared. Conversely, rhinovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus, PIV2, PIV3, metapneumovirus, coronavirus OC43, NL63, 229E were significantly more frequent among cases with multiple virus detection. Conclusions Respiratory viruses were detected in over 90% of the cases, out of which 70% had multiple viruses. Several viruses are more commonly found in multiple virus detection whereas other viruses are similarly found in sole and in multiple virus detection.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nascimento-Carvalho, Amanda C.; Vilas-Boas, Ana-Luisa; Fontoura, Maria-Socorro H.; Vuorinen, Tytti; Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a8804b701a33bef70d4df637dcb844b9fcc729f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106541.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218301537; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29908521/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218301537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","ClinicalTrials.gov","RSVA","RSVB"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["multiple viruses","frequency of respiratory viruses","Results Viruses","Conclusions Respiratory viruses","multiple virus detection","non-severe CAP cases","sole virus detection","respiratory complaints","parainfluenza virus","adenovirus","Rhinovirus","children under-","enterovirus","Study design Prospective study","frequent combination","frequency of RSVA","pediatricians","health care system","Identifier NCT01200706","metapneumovirus","PIV3","PIV2","bocavirus","radiographic pulmonary infiltrate","coronavirus OC43","major burden","consolidation","Salvador","pneumonia","nasopharyngeal aspirate samples","NL63","years","months","Information","Abstract Background Community","clinical trial","Brazil","Objectives","patients","PCRs","difference","RSVB","FluB","PIV4"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we studied the effect of the amino acid changes in 3CLpro of feline coronavirus from a feline patient who received antiviral treatment for prolonged duration. We generated recombinant 3CLpro containing the identified amino acid changes (N25S, A252S or K260 N) and determined their susceptibility to protease inhibitors in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The assay showed that N25S in 3CLpro confers a small change (up to 1.68-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration) in susceptibility to GC376, but other amino acid changes do not affect susceptibility. Modelling of 3CLpro carrying the amino acid changes was conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings.

To gain insight into virus-host interactions, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen. The expression of over 20,000 cellular genes was individually knocked down in human airway epithelial A549 cells, followed by infection with RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Knockdown of expression of the cellular ATP1A1 protein, which is the major subunit of the Na(\u002B),K(\u002B)-ATPase of the plasma membrane, had one of the strongest inhibitory effects on GFP expression and viral titer. Inhibition was not observed for vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that it was RSV-specific rather than a general effect. ATP1A1 formed clusters in the plasma membrane very early following RSV infection, which was independent of replication but dependent on the attachment glycoprotein G. RSV also triggered activation of ATP1A1, resulting in signaling by c-Src-kinase activity that transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by Tyr845 phosphorylation. ATP1A1 signaling and activation of both c-Src and EGFR were found to be required for efficient RSV uptake. Signaling events downstream of EGFR culminated in the formation of macropinosomes. There was extensive uptake of RSV virions into macropinosomes at the beginning of infection, suggesting that this is a major route of RSV uptake, with fusion presumably occurring in the macropinosomes rather than at the plasma membrane. Important findings were validated in primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). In A549 cells and HSAEC, RSV uptake could be inhibited by the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 (rostafuroxin) that bind specifically to the ATP1A1 extracellular domain and block RSV-triggered EGFR Tyr845 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we identified ATP1A1 as a host protein essential for macropinocytic entry of RSV into respiratory epithelial cells, and identified PST2238 as a potential anti-RSV drug.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lingemann, Matthias; McCarty, Thomas; Liu, Xueqiao; Buchholz, Ursula J.; Surman, Sonja; Martin, Scott E.; Collins, Peter L.; Munir, Shirin","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4867e0d05f067189d610ca8e764d52dcc50a7b49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6695199.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381610/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["G.

However, there is limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products against EBOV, because the virus has a high biosafety level and is only available in a few laboratories worldwide. The virucidal efficacy of antiseptics and disinfectants can be determined using the European Standard EN14476:2013/FprA1:2015. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was introduced in 2014 as a reference virus for the claim \u2018virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash\u2019. For EBOV, also an enveloped virus, the suitability of MVA as a surrogate needs to be proven. The aim of this study was to test the in vitro efficacy of four povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations against EBOV: 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser; 7.5 % PVP-I surgical scrub; 10 % PVP-I solution; and 3.2 % PVP-I and 78 % alcohol solution. The formulations were tested with MVA to define the test conditions, and as a secondary objective the suitability of MVA as a surrogate for enveloped viruses like EBOV was assessed. METHODS: According to EN14476, a standard suspension test was used for MVA. Large-volume plating was used for EBOV to increase test sensitivity and exclude potential after-effects. All products were tested under clean (0.3 g/L BSA) and dirty (3.0 g/L BSA \u002B 3.0 mL/L erythrocytes) conditions with MVA for 15, 30, and 60 s. The concentration-contact time values obtained with MVA were verified for EBOV. RESULTS: Viral titres of MVA and EBOV were reduced by \u003E99.99 % to \u003E99.999 % under clean and dirty conditions after application of the test products for 15 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: All products showed excellent virucidal efficacy against EBOV, demonstrating the important role PVP-I can play in helping to prevent and limit the spread of Ebola virus disease. The efficacy against both test viruses after 15 s is helpful information for the implementation of guidance for people potentially exposed to EBOV, and confirms the excellent virucidal efficacy of PVP-I against enveloped viruses. MVA was found to be a suitable surrogate for enveloped viruses like EBOV.","publish_time":"2015-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eggers, Maren; Eickmann, Markus; Kowalski, Katharina; Zorn, Juergen; Reimer, Karen","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6548b941beede8bb57cde83a928e4383b54697ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4574578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1111-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26381737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","MVA","BSA"],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["EBOV","efficacy of virucidal products","test viruses","suitability of MVA","test products","excellent virucidal efficacy of PVP","enveloped viruses","test conditions","virucidal efficacy of antiseptics","efficacious virucidal products","reference virus","recent Ebola virus","Viral titres of MVA","virucidal active","spread of Ebola virus disease","test sensitivity","important role PVP","standard suspension test","Modified vaccinia virus Ankara","dirty conditions","suitable surrogate","surrogate needs","BSA","formulations","European Standard EN14476","hand wash","alcohol solution","hygienic hand rub","epidemic","claim","helpful information","implementation of guidance","infection","application","secondary objective","high biosafety level","disinfectants","concentration-contact time values","povidone iodine","limited data","FprA1","potential after-effects","RESULTS","people","BACKGROUND","surgical scrub","erythrocytes","CONCLUSIONS","Large-volume plating","study","seconds","cleanser","laboratories","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, a role for virus-specific memory B cells (Bmem) within the CNS is poorly explored due to lack of robust phenotypic or functional identification in mice. This study takes advantage of the progeny of mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Cre-ERT2) under the Aicda promoter crossed with Rosa26-loxP-tdTomato reporter mice (AID(Cre)-Rosa26(tdTomato)) to monitor B cells having undergone activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) following neurotropic coronavirus infection. AID detection via tdTomato expression allowed tracking of virus-specific ASC and Bmem in priming and effector sites throughout infection. In draining lymph nodes, tdTomato-positive (tdTomato(\u002B)) ASC were most prevalent prior to germinal center (GC) formation, but total tdTomato(\u002B) B cells only peaked with robust GC formation at day 14 p.i. Moreover, their proportion of Bmem dominated over the proportion of ASC throughout infection. In the CNS, tdTomato(\u002B) cells started emerging at day 14 p.i. While they initially comprised mainly Bmem, the proportions of ASC and Bmem became similar as tdTomato(\u002B) B cells increased throughout viral persistence. Delayed tamoxifen treatment demonstrated ongoing CNS recruitment of tdTomato(\u002B) B cells, mainly ASC, primed late during GC reactions. Overall, the data support the idea that virus-induced B cells exhibiting SHM require peripheral GC formation to emerge in the CNS. Ongoing GC reactions and regional signals further regulate dynamics within the CNS, with preferential maintenance of tdTomato(\u002B) B cells in spinal cords relative to that in brains during viral persistence. IMPORTANCE The prevalence and role of antigen-specific Bmem in the CNS during viral encephalomyelitis is largely undefined. A lack of reliable markers identifying murine Bmem has made it difficult to assess their contribution to local antiviral protection via antigen presentation or conversion to ASC. Using reporter mice infected with neurotropic coronavirus to track virus-specific Bmem and ASC, this report demonstrates that both subsets only emerge in the CNS following peripheral GC formation and subsequently prevail. While early GC reactions supported preferential Bmem accumulation in the CNS, late GC reactions favored ASC accumulation, although Bmem outnumbered ASC in draining lymph nodes throughout infection. Importantly, virus-specific B cells undergoing sustained GC selection were continually recruited to the persistently infected CNS. Elucidating the factors governing temporal events within GCs, as well as regional CNS cues during viral persistence, will aid intervention to modulate CNS humoral responses in the context of infection and associated autoimmune pathologies.","publish_time":"2019-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atkinson, Jeffrey R.; Hwang, Mihyun; Reyes-Rodriguez, Angel; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f880cb0b394ac20be2a2868fecaefd4d8f341b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6321933.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30333176/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00875-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","Cre","ASC","SHM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific ASC","virus-specific B cells","Bmem outnumbered ASC","infected CNS","virus-specific Bmem","virus-induced B cells","ongoing CNS recruitment of tdTomato","ASC accumulation","proportion of ASC","proportion of Bmem","virus-specific memory B cells","secreting cells","murine Bmem","proportions of ASC","tdTomato expression","tdTomato-positive","total tdTomato","tdTomato reporter mice","CNS humoral responses","late GC reactions","Ongoing GC reactions","robust GC formation","peripheral GC formation","regional CNS cues","preferential Bmem accumulation","early GC reactions","preferential maintenance of tdTomato","viral persistence","sustained GC selection","neurotropic coronavirus infection","tracking of virus","neurotropic viral infections","viral encephalomyelitis","context of infection","progeny of mice","AID detection","Cre-ERT2","SHM","role of antigen","draining lymph nodes","local protection","day","tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase","lack of robust phenotypic","local antiviral protection","antigen presentation","Rosa26-loxP","regional signals","Delayed tamoxifen treatment","lack of reliable markers","undergone activation-induced cytidine deaminase","antibody","central nervous system","spinal cords relative","contribution","brains","functional identification","GCs","conversion","somatic hypermutation","dynamics","germinal center","intervention","idea","Aicda promoter","effector sites","prevalence","factors","temporal events","advantage","IMPORTANCE","autoimmune pathologies","study","data","subsets"],"language":"en"},

We address the current gaps in knowledge, including the need for mechanistic understanding of BST-2 antagonism by respiratory viruses, that should be bridged to achieve that goal.","publish_time":"2018-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berry, Kayla N.; Kober, Daniel L.; Su, Alvin; Brett, Tom J.","journal":"BioEssays","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e11e45d09723242760d242a3b5ae926c2c1dd961.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6371793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30113067/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/bies.201800086; https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201800086","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunology of BST","respiratory virus infections","respiratory syncytial virus","mechanistic understanding of BST","antiviral function","universal replication inhibitor of enveloped respiratory viruses","antiviral state","viral replication","influenza","cells","cellular biology","need","antagonism","knowledge","therapies","Recent findings","plasma membrane","mechanisms","countermeasures","current gaps","review","comprehensive summary","tetherin","goal"],"language":"en"},

However, in contrast to many other species and despite expression of functional virus entry receptors, mice are resistant to henipavirus infection. We report here the susceptibility of mice deleted for the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-KO) to both HeV and NiV. Intraperitoneally infected mice developed fatal encephalitis, with pathology and immunohistochemical features similar to what was found in humans. Viral RNA was found in the majority of analyzed organs, and sublethally infected animals developed virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.

Clay minerals are efficient against several aggressors that cause major disorders of the gut. These beneficial effects of clay minerals (on the gastrointestinal mucosa) are associated with two mechanisms of action: (1) adsorption of the aggressors or their toxic secretions and (2) modification of the thickness and rheological properties of the adherent mucus, reinforcing the natural defenses of the gastrointestinal mucosa. At the surface of the gut, a mucus gel adheres to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. This adherent mucus is dynamic, being continuously secreted by the calceiform cells and regularly eroded by environmental aggressors present in the gut lumen. The mucus gel is largely composed of glycoprotein polymers, lipids, and proteins linked together by covalent bonds. It acts as a physical barrier protecting the mucosa against penetration by extraneous molecules and mechanical injury. By maintaining a pH gradient and competing with the epithelial surface for microorganisms, the mucus gel also acts as a chemical barrier.","publish_time":"2007-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Droy-Lefaix, M.T.; Tateo, F.","journal":"Dev Clay Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/244ca34b4ce1ca259d290c3eed80339ecd0d9c1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185446.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1572435205010251; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1572-4352(05)01025-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362802/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572435205010251","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucus gel","adherent mucus","gastrointestinal mucosa","epithelial cells","clay materials","epithelial surface","gut lumen","beneficial effects of clay minerals","environmental aggressors present","calceiform cells","physical barrier","chemical barrier","penetration","proteins","modification","extraneous molecules","rheological properties","natural defenses","applications of clays","glycoprotein polymers","mechanical injury","thickness","microorganisms","toxic secretions","major disorders","lipids","adsorption","drugs","pH gradient","covalent bonds","chapter","mechanisms of action"],"language":"en"},

But the potential value of such restrictions has not been quantified. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic model and used parameters from a published model (i.e., InfluSim) and travel data from Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). RESULTS: The results indicate that of the 17 PICTs with travel data, only six would be likely to escape a major pandemic with a viral strain of relatively low contagiousness (i.e., for R(0 )= 1.5) even when imposing very tight travel volume reductions of 99% throughout the course of the pandemic. For a more contagious viral strain (R(0 )= 2.25) only five PICTs would have a probability of over 50% to escape. The total number of travellers during the pandemic must not exceed 115 (for R(0 )= 3.0) or 380 (for R(0 )= 1.5) if a PICT aims to keep the probability of pandemic arrival below 50%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that relatively few island nations could successfully rely on intensive travel volume restrictions alone to avoid the arrival of pandemic influenza (or subsequent waves). Therefore most island nations may need to plan for multiple additional interventions (e.g., screening and quarantine) to raise the probability of remaining pandemic free or achieving substantial delay in pandemic arrival.","publish_time":"2009-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eichner, Martin; Schwehm, Markus; Wilson, Nick; Baker, Michael G","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69422fc5757c3c88a574d830594a4dc1a06337b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2761921.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19788751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probability of pandemic arrival","major pandemic","arrival of pandemic influenza","influenza pandemic plans","travel data","island nations","probability of remaining pandemic free","travel warnings","PICTs","RESULTS","intensive travel volume restrictions","tight travel volume reductions","Pacific Island Countries","contagious viral strain","published model","probabilistic model","incoming travellers","total number of travellers","explicit components","substantial delay","InfluSim","Territories","screening","parameters","low contagiousness","multiple additional interventions","subsequent waves","quarantine","BACKGROUND","potential value","METHODS","course","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, virological surveillance of animals and particularly great apes is of great interest to establish the repertory of viruses associated with healthy hosts. This will further help to identify the emergence of new viruses and predict the possibility of interspecies transmission. In this study, we performed shotgun viral metagenomics on stool samples collected from seventeen free-living wild gorillas from the Republic of the Congo. The analysis revealed the presence of novel RNA viruses (picobirnaviruses, partitivirus, and Picornavirales (posa-like and dicistrovirus-like viruses)). Among these, picobirnavirus-related sequences were abundantly covered in the stools. Based on genetic variations both in capsid and RdRp proteins of picobirnaviruses, at least 96 variants were identified and most of them were novel. Among the 96, 22 variants had a nearly complete genome or segment. A comprehensive sequence analysis identified a potential new genogroup/genetic cluster and the presence of a short linear amino acid motif (ExxRxNxxxE) in a hypothetical protein. The sequence analysis of posa-like virus and dicistrovirus showed that these two viruses were novel members in the respective viral families. In conclusion, the identification of novel RNA viruses and their genetic diversity increases our knowledge about viruses that are associated with stools of wild gorillas and contributes to the initiatives in the search for potential emerging zoonotic viruses.

The influenza A virus genome consists of negative sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA. Influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface antigens known as hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The main problem with influenza A viruses infecting humans is drug resistance, which is caused by antigenic changes. A few antiviral drugs are available, but the most popular is the neuraminidase inhibitor \u2014 oseltamivir. The resistance against this drug has probably developed through antigenic drift by a point mutation in one amino acid at position 275 (H275Y). In order to prevent a possible influenza pandemic it is necessary to develop fast diagnostic tests. The aim of this project was to develop a new test for detection of influenza A virus and determination of oseltamivir resistance/sensitivity in humans. Detection and differentiation of oseltamivir resistance/sensitivity of influenza A virus was based on real-time PCR. This test contains two TaqMan probes, which work at different wavelengths. Application of techniques like multiplex real-time PCR has greatly enhanced the capability for surveillance and characterization of influenza viruses. After its potential validation, this test can be used for diagnosis before treatment.","publish_time":"2014-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nidzworski, Dawid; Dobkowska, Joanna; Ho\u0142ysz, Marcin; Gromadzka, Beata; Szewczyk, Bogus\u0142aw","journal":"Cent Eur J Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b26b0111caee194293075ca227137c88b59ee0fe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215120/; https://doi.org/10.2478/s11535-014-0296-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitivity of influenza","detection of influenza","characterization of influenza viruses","possible influenza pandemic","drug resistance","determination of oseltamivir resistance","differentiation of oseltamivir resistance","virus genome","new test","real-time PCR","contagious disease of humans","antigenic drift","neuraminidase inhibitor","antigenic changes","point mutation","amino acid","negative sense","capability","surface antigens","position","hemagglutinin","animals","subtypes","surveillance","TaqMan probes","fast diagnostic tests","main problem","H275Y","project","Application of techniques","order","different wavelengths","segmented RNA","antiviral drugs","diagnosis","potential validation","Orthomyxoviridae family","treatment","aim"],"language":"en"},

Computer analysis of the protein sequence revealed the characteristics of a class III membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence but containing three successive transmembrane \u03B1-helices in the N-terminal half, much the same as the coronavirus membrane (M) protein. The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the EM protein, expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum. The common features of the torovirus E and the coronavirus M protein support our hypothesis that an evolutionary relationship exists between these groups of intracellularly budding viruses.","publish_time":"1991-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Den Boon, Johan A.; Snijder, Eric J.; Locker, Jacomine Krijnse; Horzinek, Marian C.; Rottier, Peter J.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b0e01ca31343bc3450b28109c522b2b23cbd5b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190606C; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190606C","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane protein","protein sequence","EM protein","protein gene","hybrid E protein","coronavirus membrane","torovirus E","nucleotide sequence","translation product","cleaved signal sequence","C-terminal tail","intracellular membranes","C-terminus","vesicle membranes","Immunofluorescence experiments","Berne virus envelope","recombinant vaccinia virus","N-terminal half","successive transmembrane \u03B1-helices","class","characteristics","presence of microsomes","groups","subsequent proteinase","hypothesis","anti-peptide serum","evolutionary relationship","digestion","opposite sides","common features","transcription","Computer analysis","similarity","small portions","polypeptide","budding viruses","disposition","endoplasmic reticulum"],"language":"en"},

Previously published research on South Korea\u0027s MERS outbreak was limited to the early stages, when few data were available. Now that the outbreak has ended, albeit unofficially, a more comprehensive review is appropriate. Methods Data were obtained through the MERS portal by the Ministry for Health and Welfare (MOHW) and Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, press releases by MOHW, and reports by the MERS Policy Committee of the Korean Medical Association. Cases were analysed for general characteristics, exposure source, timeline and infection generation. Sex, age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths. Findings Beginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted. The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years. As in most other countries, more men than women were affected. The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%). In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no community-acquired infections. The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension. The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of \u2018super spreaders\u2019, familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and \u2018doctor shopping\u2019. The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, K.

The objective of this study was to establish and validate assays to monitor host immune responses in the hamster including important pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and innate immune responses, as well as markers of apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell junction integrity and coagulation. Commercially available mouse and rat ELISA and luminex panels were screened for potential cross-reactivity, but were found to be of limited value for studying host responses in hamsters. Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of 51 immune-related and four internal reference genes were developed. To validate the immune-related assays, hamsters were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Indiana species, or treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and host immune responses were monitored in selected organs. Ribosomal protein L18 was identified as the most stable internal reference gene. In conclusion, these new assays will greatly improve the use of the hamster as an important small animal model in infectious disease research.","publish_time":"2011-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zivcec, Marko; Safronetz, David; Haddock, Elaine; Feldmann, Heinz; Ebihara, Hideki","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e76810fc458772467ba2b8ae159eb486f0cbbac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f6e6bc38234d39ab937607893cf4a9e31271f0d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3085612.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175911000366; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3085612?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21334343/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175911000366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host immune responses","innate immune responses","humoral immune responses","immune-related assays","monitoring host responses","specific assays","new assays","under-utilized animal model","important small animal model","hamsters","Syrian Golden hamster","internal reference genes","cell proliferation","stable internal reference gene","limited value","cell junction integrity","clinical observations","pathology","studies of human viral pathogens","luminex panels","quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","qRT-PCR","bunyaviruses","infectious disease research","Mesocricetus auratus","vesicular stomatitis virus","henipaviruses","VSV","rat ELISA","arenaviruses","lack of suitable reagents","markers of apoptosis","lipopolysaccharide","available mouse","Indiana species","flaviviruses","coagulation","detection","LPS","potential cross-reactivity","selected organs","SARS-coronavirus","Ribosomal protein L18","study","conclusion","objective"],"language":"en"},

Viruses, bacteria and pathogen-related molecules interact with cells present in the human alveolus by numerous, yet poorly understood ways. Traditional cell culture models little reflect the cellular composition, matrix complexity and three-dimensional architecture of the human lung. Integrative animal models suffer from species differences, which are of particular importance for the investigation of zoonotic lung diseases. The use of cultured ex vivo infected human lung tissue may overcome some of these limitations and complement traditional models. The present review gives an overview of common bacterial lung infections, such as pneumococcal infection and of widely neglected pathogens modeled in ex vivo infected lung tissue. The role of ex vivo infected lung tissue for the investigation of emerging viral zoonosis including influenza A virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is discussed. Finally, further directions for the elaboration of such models are revealed. Overall, the introduced models represent meaningful and robust methods to investigate principles of pathogen-host interaction in original human lung tissue.","publish_time":"2016-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hocke, Andreas C.; Suttorp, Norbert; Hippenstiel, Stefan","journal":"Cell Tissue Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87e9b88a0a34188ecbb3adeb2838c48d397e96c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087833.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-016-2546-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27999962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["infected lung tissue","infected human lung tissue","original human lung tissue","traditional models","introduced models","investigation of zoonotic lung diseases","human alveolus","Integrative animal models","overview of common bacterial lung infections","Traditional cell culture models","role of ex","use of cultured ex","principles of pathogen","present review","pathogen-related molecules","investigation of emerging viral zoonosis","influenza","cellular composition","host interaction","three-dimensional architecture","robust methods","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","matrix complexity","species differences","pneumococcal infection","neglected pathogens","particular importance","cells","Viruses","limitations","leading causes of death","understood ways","Pneumonia","directions","elaboration"],"language":"en"},

As the case count amongst children is low, there is need to report COVID-19 in children to better understand the virus and the disease. CASES: In Malaysia, until end of February 2020, there were four COVID-19 paediatric cases with ages ranging from 20 months to 11 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China. The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness. The cases were managed symptomatically. None required antiviral therapy. DISCUSSION: There were 2 major issues regarding the care of infected children. Firstly, the quarantine of an infected child with a parent who tested negative was an ethical dilemma. Secondly, oropharyngeal and nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results. These issues have implications for infection control. Consequently, there is a need for clearer guidelines for child quarantine and testing methods in the management of COVID-19 in children.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"See, K.C.; Liew, S.M.; Ng, David C.E.; Chew, E.L.; Khoo, E.M.; Sam, C.H.; Sheena, D.; Zahilah Filzah, M.Z.; Chin, S.Y.; Lee, P.Y.; Tan, L.P.; Najwa, Z.

In addition, recent research has suggested their modulatory activity in immune induction. Given that most subunit vaccines require an adjuvant to achieve effective immune induction through the activation of innate immunity, AMPs are plausible candidate molecules for stimulating not only innate immune but also adaptive immune responses. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the ability of human \u03B2-defensin (HBD) 2 to promote antiviral immunity in vitro and in vivo using a receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein (S RBD) as a model antigen (Ag). When HBD 2-conjugated S RBD was used to treat THP-1 human monocytic cells, the expression levels of antiviral (IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, MxA, PKR, and RNaseL) and primary immune-inducing (NOD2, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-6) molecules were enhanced compared to those expressed after treatment with S RBD only. The expression of chemokines capable of recruiting leukocytes, including monocytes/macrophages, natural killer cells, granulocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells, was also increased following HBD 2-conjugated S RBD treatment. More important, immunization of mice with HBD 2-conjugated S RBD enhanced the immunogenicity of the S RBD and elicited a higher S RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response than S RBD alone. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HBD 2 activates the primary antiviral innate immune response and may also mediate the induction of an effective adaptive immune response against a conjugated Ag.","publish_time":"2018-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ju; Yang, Ye Lin; Jang, Sun-Hee; Jang, Yong-Suk","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cc7d19d8c064e59978daa0699ca18d5b139b0db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6083524.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1035-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBD","RBD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["conjugated S RBD treatment","innate immune defense","effective immune induction","primary antiviral innate immune response","effective adaptive immune response","adaptive immune responses","higher S RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response","following HBD","conjugated Ag","T cells","dendritic cells","IFN-\u03B2","antiviral immunity","human monocytic cells","activation of innate immunity","natural killer cells","expression levels of antiviral","AMPs","ability of human \u03B2-defensin","IFN-\u03B3","plausible candidate molecules","expression of chemokines capable of recruiting leukocytes","monocytes","macrophages","MERS-CoV","granulocytes","Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","spike protein","PKR","MxA","modulatory activity","invading microorganisms","NOD2","adjuvant","THP","immunogenicity","receptor-binding domain","recent research","TNF-\u03B1","RNaseL","immunization of mice","model antigen","viruses","BACKGROUND","Antimicrobial peptides","subunit vaccines","study","addition","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The frequency estimates are very heterogeneous; in the population under two years the frequency of admission for bronchiolitis is between 1 and 3.5%, primary care consultations between 4 and 20% and emergency visits between 1 and 2%. The frequency of admissions for respiratory infection by respiratory syncytial virus in the risk population is: in premature infants \u226432 weeks of gestation between 4.4 and 18%, in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia between 7.3 and 42%, and in infants with congenital heart disease between 1.6 and 9.8%. The main risk factors are: prematurity, chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease and age less than 3 \u2013 6 months at onset of the epidemic. Other factors are: older siblings or day care attendance, male gender, exposure to smoking, breastfeeding for less than 1 \u2013 2 months and variables associated with lower socioeconomic status. Respiratory syncytial virus is the dominant etiological agent, constituting just over half the cases (median 56%; interval 27% to 73%). Other viruses implicated, in descending order of frequency, are rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza, enterovirus and bocavirus. In studies with genomic detection techniques, between 20 and 25% of cases the virus involved is not identified and between 9% and 27% of cases have viral co-infection. Although respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis shows more wheezing and retractions, longer duration of respiratory symptoms and oxygen therapy and are associated with lower use of antibiotics. This pattern is associated with the younger age of the patients and does not help us to predict the etiology. In general, the etiological identification is not useful for the management of patients. However, in young infants (\u003C3 months) with febrile bronchiolitis in the hospital environment, conservative management may help these patients and avoid diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.","publish_time":"2010-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ochoa Sangrador, C.; Gonz\u00E1lez de Dios, J.","journal":"An Pediatr (Barc)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105046.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2009.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis","respiratory infection","months","management of patients","cases","risk population","febrile bronchiolitis","frequency of admissions","frequency estimates","congenital heart disease","main risk factors","longer duration of respiratory symptoms","bronchopulmonary dysplasia","clinical-etiological profile of acute bronchiolitis","etiological identification","premature infants","descending order of frequency","young infants","etiology","chronic lung disease","dominant etiological agent","influenza viruses","conservative management","younger age","day care attendance","lower socioeconomic status","viral co-infection","primary care consultations","lower use of antibiotics","prematurity","retractions","male gender","rhinovirus","oxygen therapy","older siblings","parainfluenza","metapneumovirus","exposure","adenovirus","hospital environment","epidemiology","enterovirus","variables","evidence","years","studies","genomic detection techniques","smoking","bocavirus","weeks of gestation","diagnostic","therapeutic procedures","review","pattern","interval","onset","epidemic","emergency visits"],"language":"en"},

However, the primary care system in South Korea is not well established, and primary care research is still in its infancy. This study aimed to show the benefits of regular doctors as primary care providers in South Korea by analyzing the effect of regular doctor visits on emergency room (ER) visits. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 11,293 adults aged 18 years and over collected from the 2013 Korea Health Panel Survey (beta version 1.0). We classified those participants with and without regular doctors into the treatment and control groups, respectively, and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of having a regular doctor on ER visits. We used counterfactual framework and propensity score analysis to adjust for unevenly distributed confounding covariates between treatments and control groups. RESULTS: The estimated conditional ATE of a regular doctor on ER visits was statistically insignificant in the general population (-0.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 1.2) and in the subgroup of patients with hypertension (-1.8%; 95% CI, -4.5 to 0.9). However, in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the estimated ATE was statistically significant (-5.0; 95% CI, -9.2 to -0.7). CONCLUSION: In the total study population, having a regular doctor did not result in a significant difference in ER visits.

Coupled with the emerging biological and pathological significance of carbohydrates, lectins have become extensively used as research tools in glycobiology. However, lectin-based drug development has been impeded by high manufacturing costs, low chemical stability, and the potential risk of initiating an unfavorable immune response. As alternatives to lectins, non-protein small molecules having carbohydrate-binding properties (lectin mimics) are currently attracting a great deal of attention because of their ease of preparation and chemical modification. Lectin mimics of synthetic origin are divided roughly into two groups, boronic acid-dependent and boronic acid-independent lectin mimics. This article outlines their representative architectures and carbohydrate-binding properties, and discusses their therapeutic potential by reviewing recent attempts to develop antiviral and antimicrobial agents using their architectures.

The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","publish_time":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cirone, Francesco; Padalino, Barbara; Tullio, Daniele; Capozza, Paolo; Losurdo, Michele; Lanave, Gianvito; Pratelli, Annamaria","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ca853dca7e2037fb95acf0b90ce59c9776979b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6940923.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9121093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pasteurella"],"organizations":["DNS","Fifty-six Limousine"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of bovine coronavirus","bovine adenovirus","prevalence of pathogens","Bovine respiratory disease","prevalence of different pathogens","bovine parainfluenza virus","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type","bovine viral diarrhea virus","BRD","prevalence of BCoV","different days","higher prevalence of Histophilus somni","different shipments","tested animals","nasal microbiota of beef steers","T1","somni positive animals","DNS","T0","Limousine animals","Mannheimia haemolytica","Pasteurella multocida","Mycoplasma bovis","arrival farm","beef industry","nasal microbiota changes","increased risk of pathogens","BVDV","lower respiratory tract of cattle","BRSV","France","southern Italy","BoHV","pathogen proliferation","long-distance journey","comparison","departure","outcome of qPCR","fixed factors","current literature","Real Time quantitative PCR","dependent categorical dichotomous variable","BPiV","BAdV","economic problem","serious health","deep nasopharyngeal swabs","route","semitrailer","SIMPLE SUMMARY","epidemiological status","number of","hypothesis","ABSTRACT","high mortality","multifactorial etiology","agreement","results","syndrome","stress","data","study","Univariate logistic regression","role","total","transportation","bimolecular analysis"],"language":"en"},

Recent trials have suggested that its effect on long term functional outcome is neutral or negative, despite apparently promising preclinical data. Systematic review and meta-analysis is a useful tool to collate experimental data and investigate the basis of its conclusions. We searched three online databases to identify studies testing systemic hypothermia as monotherapy for treatment of animals subjected to a TBI. Data pertaining to TBI paradigm, animal subjects and hypothermia management were extracted as well as those relating to risk of bias. We pooled outcome data where sufficient numbers allowed and investigated heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariate meta-regression. We identified 90 publications reporting 272 experiments testing hypothermia in animals subject to TBI. The subjects were mostly small animals, with well-established models predominating. Target temperature was comparable to clinical trial data but treatment was initiated very early. Study quality was low and there was some evidence of publication bias. Delay to treatment, comorbidity and blinded outcome assessment appeared to predict neurobehavioral outcome on multivariate meta-regression. Therapeutic hypothermia appears to be an efficacious treatment in experimental TBI, which differs from the clinical evidence. The preclinical literature showed limitations in quality and design and these both appeared to affect neurobehavioral experiment outcome. These should be acknowledged when designing and interpreting preclinical TBI studies in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirst, Theodore C; Klasen, Max G; Rhodes, Jonathan; Macleod, Malcolm R; Andrews, Peter Jd","journal":"Journal of neurotrauma","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394804/; https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.6923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcome data","experimental TBI","preclinical data","preclinical TBI studies","hypothermia management","TBI paradigm","treatment of animals","Therapeutic hypothermia","experimental data","systemic hypothermia","neurobehavioral experiment outcome","Data pertaining","clinical trial data","efficacious treatment","blinded outcome assessment","multivariate meta-regression","neurobehavioral outcomes","long term functional outcome","meta-analysis","small animals","animals subject","preclinical literature","clinical evidence","evidence of publication bias","animal subjects","Study quality","risk of bias","investigated heterogeneity","mainstay of severe traumatic brain injury","effect","useful tool","sufficient numbers","comorbidity","monotherapy","Target temperature","limitations","experiments","Systematic review","online databases","design","well-established models","Delay","basis","future","Recent trials","publications","century","conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Methods A total of 48 Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal control group, the damp-heat syndrome model group, the Haoqinqingdan decoction group (high, medium and low dose group) and the ribavirin group. The body temperature and weight of rats in each group were recorded after modeling. After treatment for 6 d, the concentration of T lymphocyte subgroup (CD3\u002BCD4\u002B, CD3\u002BCD8\u002B) was determined by flow cytometry. The OD value of IFN-\u03B3/IL-4 was detected by double-antibody sandwich ELISA method, and its concentration was acquired through conversion. Results After modeling, the temperature and weight of rats in each modeling group showed the increasing trend (P\u003C0.01). From the second day of treatment, there was significant difference in the body mass between groups, and the rat weight of the control group was higher than in the modeling group (P\u003C0.05 or 0.01). With the advances of treatment, only the temperature in the medium and high dose Haoqinqingdan decoction groups declined significantly (P\u003C0.05). After treatment, the CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B ratio of the damp-heat syndrome model group decreased more significantly compared with the control group. Elevated CD3\u002B CD8\u002B percentages and declined CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B ratios can be observed in the low dose group and ribavirin group (P\u003C0.05).

ZIKV can cross the placental barrier and infect foetal brains, resulting in microcephaly, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV is poorly understood. With recent findings reporting AXL as a type I interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor, the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved. Here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in ZIKV infection. Removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished ZIKV infection in Vero cells and human induced-pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less ZIKV infection of both African and Asian lineages. Huh7 cells deficient in \u03B12,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of ST3 \u03B2-galactoside-\u03B12,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Removal of membrane-bound, un-internalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in ZIKV internalization but not attachment. Sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, implying that sialic acid could be mediating ZIKV-receptor complex internalization.

Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non-severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities. RESULTS: We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI\u003E 25 kg/m(2), prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.6\u201331.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.3\u201321.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.3\u201318.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV. However, hypertension (45.0%, 39.1\u201351.0%), diabetes (24.7%, 20.2\u201329.8%) and heart diseases (25.6%, 19.5\u201332.7%) were the most prevalent in WNV. ORs of severe flavivirus diseases were about 2 to 4 in infected patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. The small number of studies in JEV, YFV and Zika did not permit estimating the prevalence of comorbidities in these infections. CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found in severe cases of flavivirus diseases compared to non-severe cases. Findings of the present study may guide public health practitioners and clinicians to evaluate infection severity based on the presence of comorbidity, a critical public health measure that may avert severe disease outcome given the current dearth of clear prevention practices for some flavivirus diseases.","publish_time":"2018-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Badawi, Alaa; Velummailum, Russanthy; Ryoo, Seung Gwan; Senthinathan, Arrani; Yaghoubi, Sahar; Vasileva, Denitsa; Ostermeier, Emma; Plishka, Mikayla; Soosaipillai, Marcel; Arora, Paul","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76a1894ee3ade28e1fd11edd750b988c81ad459b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6039036.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29990356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic diseases","severe cases of flavivirus diseases","ORs of severe flavivirus diseases","heart diseases","prevalence of comorbidities","cardiovascular diseases","non-severe infections","presence of chronic comorbidities","Higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities","prevalent comorbidities","non-severe cases","frequency of chronic comorbidities","prevalence estimates of comorbidities","diabetes","severe disease outcome","increased risk of severe viral expression","chronic conditions","DENV","WNV","hypertension","public health practitioners","small number of studies","critical public health measure","Zika","risk of progression","obesity","substantial global public health concern","risk of bias tool","Embase Classic","yellow fever","dengue fever","infection severity","presence of comorbidity","present study","Study quality","grey literature databases","current dearth of clear prevention practices","Ovid MEDLINE","West Nile virus","comprehensive search","PubMed","JEV","clinicians","Age-adjusted odds ratios","YFV","inclusion","CONCLUSION","infected patients","asthma","BACKGROUND","METHODS","BMI","Findings","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Although many variables are associated with development of NEC, only prematurity has been consistently identified in case-controlled studies. Traditionally, the diving seal reflex has been invoked as the mechanism responsible for ischaemic injury and necrosis. Intestinal ischaemia is likely to be the final common pathway in NEC; however, it is due to the release of vasoconstricting substances, such as platelet activating factor, rather than perinatal asphyxia. Bacteria and/or bacterial toxins are likely to have a key role in the pathogenesis of NEC by fostering production of inflammatory mediators. The role of feeding practices in the pathogenesis of NEC remains controversial. Treatment of infants with NEC generally includes a regimen of bowel rest, gastric decompression, systemic antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. Infants with perforation are generally operated upon; however, there has been recent interest in primary peritoneal drainage as an alternative. Prevention of NEC still remains elusive. Avoidance of preterm birth, use of antenatal steroids and breast-milk feeding are practices that offer the greatest potential benefits. Use of any other strategy should await further trials.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jane S; Polin, Richard A","journal":"Seminars in Neonatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a217f188e1acda2ff514d225003dfbc2a8efc1b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128229.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084275603001234; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1084275603001234","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Necrotizing"],"organizations":["NEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of NEC","development of NEC","Prevention of NEC","role of feeding practices","key role","Treatment of infants","breast-milk feeding","final common pathway","gastric decompression","systemic antibiotics","antenatal steroids","regimen of bowel rest","gastrointestinal disorder","mechanism responsible","parenteral nutrition","factor","platelet","primary peritoneal drainage","ischaemic injury","necrosis","bacterial toxins","Avoidance of preterm birth","greatest potential benefits","production of inflammatory mediators","release of vasoconstricting substances","alternative","newborn infant","prematurity","Abstract Necrotizing enterocolitis","perinatal asphyxia","Intestinal ischaemia","case-controlled studies","diving seal reflex","variables","strategy","trials","perforation"],"language":"en"},

The emergence and global spread of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus have raised questions regarding the protective effect of available seasonal vaccines and the efficacy of a newly produced matched vaccine. Methods. Ferrets were immunized with the 2008\u20132009 formulations of commercially available live attenuated (FluMist; MedImmune) or split-inactivated (Fluviral; GlaxoSmithKline) vaccines, a commercial swine vaccine (FluSure; Pfizer), or a laboratory-produced matched inactivated whole-virus vaccine (A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009). Adaptive immune responses were monitored, and the animals were challenged with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 after 5 weeks. Results. Only animals that received the swine or matched vaccines developed detectable hemagglutination- inhibiting antibodies against the challenge virus, whereas a T cell response was exclusively detected in animals vaccinated with FluMist. After challenge, all animals had high levels of virus replication in the upper respiratory tract. However, preexisting anti\u2014pandemic H1N1 2009 antibodies resulted in reduced clinical signs and improved survival. Surprisingly, FluMist was associated with a slight increase in mortality and greater lung damage, which correlated with early up-regulation of interleukin-10. Conclusions. The present study demonstrates that a single dose of matched inactivated vaccine confers partial protection against a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, and it suggests that a higher dose or prime-boost regimen may be required. The consequences of mismatched immunity to influenza merit further investigation.","publish_time":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kobinger, Gary P.; Meunier, Isabelle; Patel, Ami; Pillet, St\u00E9phane; Gren, Jason; Stebner, Shane; Leung, Anders; Neufeld, James L.; Kobasa, Darwyn; von Messling, Veronika","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/596ce34c3cad3b0a98085bd4779fd786f3ceacaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109664.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/651171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170374/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GlaxoSmithKline","Pfizer","FluMist"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus vaccine","animals","influenza virus","matched vaccines","challenge virus","produced matched vaccine","pandemic H1N1","FluMist","single dose of matched inactivated vaccine","commercial swine vaccine","antibodies","high levels of virus replication","Mexico","InDRE4487","protective effect of available seasonal vaccines","influenza merit","higher dose","partial protection","reduced clinical signs","questions","efficacy","slight increase","detectable hemagglutination","mortality","MedImmune","GlaxoSmithKline","Pfizer","greater lung damage","consequences of mismatched immunity","global spread","upper respiratory tract","T cell response","improved survival","prime-boost regimen","investigation","split","FluSure","formulations","present study","Fluviral","emergence","laboratory","Adaptive immune responses","regulation of interleukin","weeks","Background","Methods","Ferrets","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The relative importance of different respiratory pathogens and relevant microbiological data in Asian children are unclear. This study elucidated the epidemiology of respiratory infections in Hong Kong children with asthma exacerbation. Methods A total of 209 children aged 3-18 years with asthma exacerbations and 77 controls with stable asthma were recruited. The severity of asthma exacerbations was assessed according to Global Initiative for Asthma guideline, and subjects aged 6 years or older performed exhaled nitric oxide and spirometric measurements. Nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens. Results Respiratory pathogens were detected in 105 (51.0%) subjects. The presence of any respiratory pathogen was associated with asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.51\u20135.11; P \u003C .001). Specifically, human rhinovirus (HRV) infection was more common among children with asthma exacerbation (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.09\u20135.32; P = .018). All other pathogens or coinfections were not associated with asthmatic attacks. None of these respiratory infections was associated with the severity of asthma exacerbation (P \u003E .15 for all).

In the present study, we analyzed the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein, including the cleavage site, of both respiratory (n=5) and enteric (n=3) BoCV isolates including two paired isolates from the same feedlot animals and compared them with the prototype Mebus and two enteric and one respiratory BoCV strains from Quebec. A total of 75 polymorphic nucleotides were identified in the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein of BoCV isolates compared with the Mebus strain. These polymorphisms led to 42 amino acid changes at 38 distinct sites. The amino acid changes were distributed throughout the S1 subunit with clustering around residues 40\u2013118, 146\u2013179, and 458\u2013531. Among these variations, only 19 amino acid substitutions altered the charge, hydrophobicity and surface probability of the protein. Based on phylogenetic analysis, our respiratory and enteric isolates clustered into two major groups with two subgroups. Although, there were only a few amino acid changes between the respiratory and enteric paired isolates, the other two respiratory isolates, one isolated from the same farm as a paired strain and the other from a different farm, showed more sequence diversity. Amino acid alterations in residues 113, 115, 118, 146, 148, 501, 510 and 531 of respiratory isolates conferred significant changes in the predicted secondary structure compared with the prototype winter dysentery (WD) and the calf diarrhea (CD) strains of BoCV. In conclusion, the data suggests that respiratory strains of BoCV may differ genetically from the classical calf enteric and adult WD strains.","publish_time":"2002-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasoksuz, Mustafa; Sreevatsan, Srinand; Cho, Kyoung-Oh; Hoet, Armando E; Saif, Linda J","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2bde64d871631f4f02355597b9e67e321da547f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127276.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170202000047; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170202000047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory isolates","enteric isolates","respiratory BoCV strains","respiratory strains of BoCV","enteric paired isolates","amino acid changes","amino acid sequence","amino acid substitutions","Amino acid alterations","spike glycoprotein of BoCV isolates","S1 subunit","classical calf enteric","enteric bovine coronavirus","adult WD strains","significant changes","paired strain","prototype Mebus","residues","Mebus strain","calf diarrhea","S glycoprotein","sequence diversity","different farm","prototype winter dysentery","predicted secondary structure","hydrophobicity","charge","cleavage site","surface probability","major groups","CD","distinct sites","data","genetic characteristics","polymorphic nucleotides","feedlot animals","phylogenetic analysis","clustering","variations","polymorphisms","Quebec","total","present study","subgroups","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Samples from these patients were subjected to immunoassays to identify a new immune response to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae to more accurately assess a bacterial etiology. These patients also were studied carefully for evidence of viral infection using viral culture, serology and polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Sixteen of 35 exacerbations (45.7%) were associated with evidence of acute viral infection and 11 of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to homologous non-typeable H. influenzae. Overall, evidence of infection with a respiratory virus or non-typeable H. influenzae was seen in 24 of 35 exacerbations (68.6%).

The results show that exacerbations in adults with COPD were associated with infection caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. influenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. influenzae simultaneously.","publish_time":"2003-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bandi, Venkata; Jakubowycz, Marta; Kinyon, Carla; Mason, Edward O.; Atmar, Robert L.; Greenberg, Stephen B.; Murphy, Timothy F.","journal":"FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe3697f73a430e718cb568b3dc441f207229bab8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/763dfacfa897cb67df1ed94ce723b230c6bdde85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110327.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928824403001007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928824403001007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae","evidence of viral infection","homologous isolate of non-typeable","evidence of infection","absence of viral infection","evidence of acute viral infection","viral culture","new immune response","respiratory virus","COPD","patients","Infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","bacterial pathogens","bacterial etiology","development of new serum IgG","prospective longitudinal study","serology","polymerase chain reaction-based assays","immunoassays","adults","association","sputum","trend","results","Samples"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to identify pathogen-specific risk factors associated with epidemic respiratory disease in calves. A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 128 outbreaks (29 dairy, 58 dairy-mixed, and 41 beef) in Belgium (2016\u20132018). A semiquantitative PCR for 7 respiratory pathogens was done on a pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample for each herd. Potential risk factors were collected by questionnaire and derived from the national cattle registration databank. Most outbreaks occurred between October and March, and single and multiple viral infections were detected in 58.6% (75/128) and 13.3% (17/128), respectively. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was the most frequently isolated virus (38.4%), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; 29.4%) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3; 8.1%). Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni were detected in 33.3, 41.2, 89.1, and 36.4% of the herds, respectively. Specific risk factors for BCV detection were detection of M. haemolytica [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.1\u20137.5)], increasing herd size [OR = 1.3 (1.0\u20131.8) for each increase with 100 animals] and detection of BCV by antigen ELISA on feces in calves in the last year [OR = 3.6 (1.2\u201311.1)]. A seasonal effect was shown for bRSV only {more in winter compared with autumn [OR = 10.3 (2.8\u201337.5)]}. Other factors associated with bRSV were PI-3 detection [OR = 13.4 (2.1\u201386.0)], prevalence of calves with respiratory disease [OR = 1.02 (1.00\u20131.04) per 1% increase], and number of days with respiratory signs before sampling [OR = 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99) per day increase]. Next to its association with BCV, M. haemolytica was more frequently detected in herds with 5 to 10 animals per pen [OR = 8.0 (1.4\u201346.9)] compared with \u003C5 animals, and in herds with sawdust as bedding [OR = 18.3 (1.8\u2013191.6)]. Also, for H. somni, housing on sawdust was a risk factor [OR = 5.2 (1.2\u201323.0)]. Purchase of cattle [OR = 2.9 (1.0\u20138.0)] and housing of recently purchased animals in the same airspace [OR = 5.0 (1.5\u201316.5)] were risk factors for M. bovis. This study identified pathogen-specific risk factors that might be useful for the development of customized control and prevention and for the design of decision support tools to justify antimicrobial use by predicting the most likely pathogen before sampling results are available.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pardon, B.; Callens, J.; Maris, J.; Allais, L.; Van Praet, W.; Deprez, P.; Ribbens, S.","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/174b240f9833312df0f94609f19e908eaf7e285f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094370.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31954585/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030220300370; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030220300370","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogen-specific risk factors","bovine respiratory disease","Potential risk factors","respiratory pathogens","respiratory signs","BCV detection","detection of BCV","animals","epidemic respiratory disease","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","bRSV","herds","ABSTRACT Respiratory tract infections","Mannheimia haemolytica","likely pathogen","Bovine coronavirus","sawdust","prevalence of calves","cross-sectional study","housing","day increase","outbreaks","sampling results","Mycoplasma bovis","dairy-mixed","Histophilus somni","isolated virus","Purchase of cattle","herd size","multiple viral infections","national cattle registration databank","Pasteurella multocida","antimicrobial use","pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample","major concern","design of decision support tools","prevention","feces","antigen ELISA","questionnaire","development of customized control","number of days","calf rearing","beef","semiquantitative PCR","odds ratio","parainfluenzavirus type","winter","seasonal effect","year","bedding","association","confidence interval","autumn","Belgium","objective","pen","airspace"],"language":"en"},

Abstract The recent literature brings nothing new since it provides only fragmented, though undoubtedly useful, studies which remain within the prevalence interval for the different bacterias. The occurrence of germs varies with time and space; nevertheless, whatever the studied series and the site of the studies, the 3 most frequent causal germs belong to the following five strains: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Influenza A, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Legionella pneumophila. Thus, 90% of all documented pneumoniae appear to be caused by the following pathogens: Pneumococcus; most frequent in hospitalized patients; Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and respiratory viruses were predominant in outpatients, with great variations; Staphylococcus and enterobacteriace may be encountered, mostly in elderlies with major debilitating diseases; association of germs, generally including pneumococcus, are increasingly identified. Last, in 25% to 50% of cases, the causal agent is not known. Recently, some Staphylococcus meticillin-resistant were identified. The diagnosis of viruses (as well as that of atypical bacterias) seems to have improved, thanks to the use of PCR though the interest of such a diagnosis remains questionable, except for epidemiological studies, as well as the relevance of this type of test in clinical practice. Nothing really new has come out on the epidemiology of acute bronchitis, while in bacterial exacerbation of COPD, attention focused on the colonizing or infective role of H. influenzae in the genesis of bronchus inflammation.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tr\u00E9moli\u00E8res, F.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7893cf156352a62aa22eb29708fbe1a5ead47a89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130493.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X06001417; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X06001417","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["l\u0027\u00E9poque"],"keyphrases":["the studies","The diagnosis","the epidemiology","the site","The occurrence","thanks to the","influenzae in the genesis","the following pathogens","the different bacterias","the causal agent is","as well as the relevance","PCR though the interest","whatever the studied series","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","the colonizing or infective role","Streptococcus pneumoniae","most frequent causal germs belong to the following five strains","studies which remain within the prevalence interval","seems to","Haemophilus influenzae","most frequent in hospitalized patients","as well as that","documented pneumoniae appear to be caused","Abstract The recent literature brings nothing new since it provides only fragmented","while in bacterial exacerbation","test in clinical practice","agent causal","respiratory viruses were predominant in outpatients","mostly in elderlies with major debilitating diseases","epidemiological studies","with time","with great variations","Chlamydia","Staphylococcus aureus","Legionella pneumophila","associations de germes","lieu","Nothing really new","some Staphylococcus meticillin","resistant were identified","fr\u00E9quence des germes retrouv\u00E9s","atypical bacterias","patients atteints","increasingly identified","bronchus inflammation","inflammation bronchique","bact\u00E9ries li\u00E9es","diff\u00E9rentes bact\u00E9ries","diagnostic virologique","though undoubtedly useful","generally including pneumococcus","diagnosis remains questionable","pneumonies aigu\u00EBs communautaires","\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie des bronchites aigu\u00EBs","enterobacteriace may be encountered","this type","acute bronchitis","focused","except","such","come out","nevertheless","COPD","improved","tares majeures","BPCO","exacerbations de bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive","staphylocoques r\u00E9sistants","virus respiratoires","\u00E9poque","cases","grandes nouveaut\u00E9s","int\u00E9r\u00EAt","ville","Recently","vieillard","ent\u00E9robact\u00E9ries","malades hospitalis\u00E9s","r\u00E9sultats d\u0027enqu\u00EAtes parcellaires utiles","agents","known","dehors d\u0027\u00E9tudes \u00E9pid\u00E9miologiques","pertinence","m\u00E9ticilline","fourchettes de pr\u00E9valence","cellules","gr\u00E2ce","temps","r\u00F4le","litt\u00E9rature r\u00E9cente","nombreuses incertitudes","objet de d\u00E9bats","pratique clinique","gen\u00E8se","espace","pneumocoque","pneumopathies document\u00E9es","Thus","s\u00E9ries"],"language":"fr"},

Currently available data demonstrate that personal protective measures (e.g. appropriate use of hand washing and oronasal mask), as well as vaccinations (if available) reduces the risk for transmission of infectious diseases. DISCUSSION: The risk for occupationally acquired infections is sometimes an unavoidable part of daily patient care.

This protein is believed to be more conserved than other proteins of the virus, such as spike and membrane glycoprotein. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5\u03B1 and identified with pooled sera from patients in the convalescence phase of SARS. A plasmid pCI-N, encoding the full-length N gene of SARS-CoV, was constructed. Expression of the N protein was observed in COS1 cells following transfection with pCI-N. The immune responses induced by intramuscular immunization with pCI-N were evaluated in a murine model. Serum anti-N immunoglobulins and splenocytes proliferative responses against N protein were observed in immunized BALB/c mice. The major immunoglobulin G subclass recognizing N protein was immunoglobulin G2a, and stimulated splenocytes secreted high levels of gamma interferon and IL-2 in response to N protein. More importantly, the immunized mice produced strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and CD8\u002B CTL responses to N protein. The study shows that N protein of SARS-CoV not only is an important B cell immunogen, but also can elicit broad-based cellular immune responses. The results indicate that the N protein may be of potential value in vaccine development for specific prophylaxis and treatment against SARS.","publish_time":"2005-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Ping; Cao, Jie; Zhao, Lan-Juan; Qin, Zhao-Lin; Ke, Jin-Shan; Pan, Wei; Ren, Hao; Yu, Jian-Guo; Qi, Zhong-Tian","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/517e4d60093973663e37dba2969be6d7e76fbd30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111813.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682204006567; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682204006567","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CTL"],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["N protein of SARS","key protein","plasmid pCI-N","full-length N gene of SARS","SARS-CoV","Serum anti-N immunoglobulins","convalescence phase of SARS","CTL responses","splenocytes proliferative responses","broad-based cellular immune responses","immunized mice","study","immunoglobulin G2a","immunized BALB","helical nucleocapsid","c mice","major immunoglobulin G subclass","stimulated splenocytes secreted high levels of gamma interferon","DTH","CD8","specific prophylaxis","potential value","strong delayed-type hypersensitivity","pooled sera","vaccine development","IL","patients","treatment","Escherichia coli DH5\u03B1","formation","COS1 cells","intramuscular immunization","coronavirus","transfection","important B cell immunogen","virion assembly","proteins","murine model","Expression","results","membrane glycoprotein"],"language":"en"},

In addition to appropriate antibacterial therapy, initial clinical management aims to restore oxygenation and predict the most probable cause based on variables related to the underlying disease, acute respiratory failure characteristics, and radiographic findings. The cause of acute respiratory failure must then be confirmed using the most efficient, least invasive, and safest diagnostic tests. In patients with acute respiratory failure of undetermined cause, a standardised diagnostic investigation should be done immediately at admission before deciding whether to perform more invasive diagnostic procedures or to start empirical treatments.

To further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors in the airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification. However, the short and finite lifespan of primary cells in cell culture creates a bottleneck for the genetic modification of these cultures. In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based sorting, we generated homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly (I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) were not affected. Combined, these results validate our newly established protocol for the genetic modification of hAEC cultures, thereby unlocking a unique potential for detailed molecular characterization of virus\u2013host interactions in human respiratory epithelium.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jonsdottir, Hulda R.; Marti, Sabrina; Geerts, Dirk; Rodriguez, Regulo; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f442fd7cf9f7ab6a2939acae3d1eea548dafac20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6723040.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412613/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11080747","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fluorescent hAEC cultures","genetic modification of hAEC cultures","host interactions","human respiratory viruses","human respiratory epithelium","transgenic hAEC cultures","hAEC cultures amenable","human respiratory syncytial virus","human coronavirus","Primary human airway epithelial cell","cell propagation","life span of primary human cells","important host factors","host gene expression","cell culture","fluorescence-activated cell sorting","specific interactions","finite lifespan of primary cells","based sorting","airway epithelium","virus infection","detailed molecular characterization of virus","authentic target cells","based expression systems","functional characterization","incorporation of lentivirus","fluorescent reporters","propagation kinetics","inducible short hairpin","post-differentiation","ROCK","FACS","unique potential","Rho-associated protein kinase","inhibitor","exogenous poly","bottleneck","HCoV","universal platform","RNA-mediated knockdown","established protocol","hRSV","proxy","principle","modifications","lentiviral transduction","results","immune response","current study","proof"],"language":"en"},

The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements.

Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, is the primary etiological agent of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that rotavirus replication induces a MAVS-dependent type I IFN response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5, two cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors. This study reports the isolation and characterization of rotavirus RNAs that activate IFN signaling. Using an in vitro approach with purified rotavirus double-layer particles, nascent single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) transcripts (termed in vitro ssRNA) were found to be potent IFN inducers. In addition, large RNAs isolated from rotavirus-infected cells six hours post-infection (termed in vivo 6 hr large RNAs), also activated IFN signaling, whereas a comparable large RNA fraction isolated from cells infected for only one hour lacked this stimulatory activity. Experiments using knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts showed that RIG-I is required for and MDA5 partly contributes to innate immune signaling by both in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNAs. Enzymatic studies demonstrated that in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples contain uncapped RNAs with exposed 5\u2019 phosphate groups. RNAs lacking 2\u2019-O-methylated 5\u2019 cap structures were also detected in the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the rotavirus VP3 enzyme, which encodes both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities, is not completely efficient at either 5\u2019 capping or 2\u2019-O-methylation of the 5\u2019 cap structures of viral transcripts, and in this way produces RNA patterns that activate innate immune signaling through the RIG-I-like receptors.","publish_time":"2013-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uzri, Dina; Greenberg, Harry B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10fbf7274b0bdfe7153269489851fc3d8f121bcd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3720929.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23894547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hr large RNAs","rotavirus-infected cells","hr large RNA samples","characterization of rotavirus RNAs","RNA patterns","ssRNA","comparable large RNA fraction","rotavirus replication","uncapped RNAs","IFN response","double-stranded RNA virus","cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors","mammalian cells","RIG","nascent single-stranded RNA","rotavirus VP3 enzyme","innate immune response","neighboring uninfected cells","potent IFN inducers","cap structures of viral transcripts","purified rotavirus double-layer particles","viral pathogens","MDA5","induction of type","O-methylation","Previous studies","Enzymatic studies","MAVS-dependent type","primary etiological agent of severe diarrhea","Reoviridae family","antiviral milieu","hours post-infection","knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts","pro-inflammatory cytokines","strong evidence","line of defense","way","young children","guanylyltransferase","Experiments","interferons","approach","isolation","phosphate groups","methyltransferase activities","data","addition","stimulatory activity","study","capping","receptors"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Virus Influenza virus is the only human-pathogenic member of orthomyxovirus, which during evolution acquired the capability to infect the cells of various mammals and birds. Besides man common hosts are domestic animals as horse, swine, cat and poultry, among the birds especially goose and duck, and nearly all mammals living in water. The influenza virus A and B genome is segmented, when two different viruses infect one cell whole genome-segments can be exchanged (reassortment). This capability leads to a high variability of the envelope surface proteins H (haemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase), as well as the polymerase inside the virus particle. An influenza virus equipped with epitopes on its surface that are unknown by the human and animal immune system has the potential to initiate a new epidemic. Transmission for influenza virus main route is aerogene, especially by small droplets while coughing and sneezing and by smear infection, mostly by direct contact. Incubation time is usually 24 to 48hours. Early clinical symptoms are fever, all signs of inflammation in the upper respiratory tract with sore throat, nasal secretion, conjunctivitis that are associated with myalgia, chills and malaise. Prevention important is the distance from the infected, to avoid aerosol formation, and within care units disinfection of hands and utensils as from stethoscope to door handle. Essential for prevention of disease is the annual vaccination against the seasonal strains influenza virus A-H1N1, A-H3N2 and influenza virus B. Treatment unspecific by anti-inflammatory drugs and reduction of symptoms by therapy of bacterial superinfection with antibiotics. Specific: by application of neuraminidase inhibitors as oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00AE) and zanamavir (Relenza\u00AE) within 48hours after onset of the symptoms.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guertler, Lutz G.","journal":"DoctorConsult - The Journal.

As TB is a major public health problem in China, spatial analysis could be applied to detect geographic distribution of TB clusters for targeted intervention on TB epidemics. METHODS: Spatial analysis was applied for detecting TB clusters on county-based TB notification data in the national notifiable infectious disease case reporting surveillance system from 2005 to 2011. Two indicators of TB epidemic were used including new sputum smear-positive (SS\u002B) notification rate and total TB notification rate. Global Moran\u2019s I by ArcGIS was used to assess whether TB clustering and its trend were significant. SaTScan software that used the retrospective space-time analysis and Possion probability model was utilized to identify geographic areas and time period of potential clusters with notification rates on county-level from 2005 to 2011. RESULTS: Two indicators of TB notification had presented significant spatial autocorrelation globally each year (p\u003C0.01). Global Moran\u2019s I of total TB notification rate had positive trend as time went by (t=6.87, p\u003C0.01). The most likely clusters of two indicators had similar spatial distribution and size in the south-central regions of China from 2006 to 2008, and the secondary clusters in two regions: northeastern China and western China. Besides, the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate had two more large clustering centers in Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Qinghai provinces and several smaller clusters in Shanxi, Henan, Hebei and Jiangsu provinces. CONCLUSION: The total TB notification cases clustered significantly in some special areas each year and the clusters trended to aggregate with time. The most-likely and secondary clusters that overlapped among two TB indicators had higher TB burden and risks of TB transmission. These were the focused geographic areas where TB control efforts should be prioritized.","publish_time":"2013-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Fei; Cheng, Shiming; He, Guangxue; Huang, Fei; Zhang, Hui; Xu, Biao; Murimwa, Tonderayi C.; Cheng, Jun; Hu, Dongmei; Wang, Lixia","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2be4d8ed799f2556c53e6946720e3033d41060e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3868653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24367604/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083605","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moran"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Gansu","Qinghai"],"keyphrases":["TB indicators","indicators of TB notification","TB clustering","TB epidemics","geographic distribution of TB clusters","total TB notification cases","secondary clusters of total TB notification rate","indicators of TB epidemic","higher TB burden","TB control efforts","risks of TB transmission","county-based TB notification data","likely clusters","smaller clusters","notification rates","time period of potential clusters","spatial analysis","northeastern China","western China","south-central regions of China","similar spatial distribution","focused geographic areas","significant spatial autocorrelation","positive trend","special areas","year","Global Moran\u2019s","retrospective space-time analysis","Qinghai provinces","Jiangsu provinces","county-level","large clustering centers","high-burden countries","new sputum smear-positive","national notifiable infectious disease case reporting surveillance system","Gansu","Inner Mongolia","size","targeted intervention","major public health problem","Possion probability model","Shanxi","Henan","Hebei","tuberculosis","CONCLUSION","SaTScan software","world","ArcGIS","RESULTS","METHODS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

The most common clinical manifestations in patients with G6PD deficiency are neonatal jaundice and acute hemolytic anemia. The effects of microbial infection in patients with G6PD deficiency primarily relate to the hemolytic anemia caused by Plasmodium or viral infections and the subsequent medication that is required. We are interested in studying the impact of bacterial infection in G6PD-deficient cells. G6PD knock down A549 lung carcinoma cells, together with the common pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, were employed in our cell infection model. Here, we demonstrate that a lower cell viability was observed among G6PD-deficient cells when compared to scramble controls upon bacterial infection using the MTT assay. A significant increase in the intracellular ROS was detected among S. aureus-infected G6PD-deficient cells by observing dichlorofluorescein (DCF) intensity within cells under a fluorescence microscope and quantifying this signal using flow cytometry. The impairment of ROS removal is predicted to enhance apoptotic activity in G6PD-deficient cells, and this enhanced apoptosis was observed by annexin V/PI staining under a confocal fluorescence microscope and quantified by flow cytometry. A higher expression level of the intrinsic apoptotic initiator caspase-9, as well as the downstream effector caspase-3, was detected by Western blotting analysis of G6PD-deficient cells following bacterial infection. In conclusion, we propose that bacterial infection, perhaps the secreted S. aureus \u03B1-hemolysin in this case, promotes the accumulation of intracellular ROS in G6PD-deficient cells. This would trigger a stronger apoptotic activity through the intrinsic pathway thereby reducing cell viability when compared to wild type cells.","publish_time":"2013-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Yi-Ting; Lin, Mei-Hui; Ho, Hung-Yao; Chen, Lei-Chin; Chen, Chien-Cheng; Shu, Jwu-Ching","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebf258ca8bfc0adbd09d0ebe0c5f25688fbc7c34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3817128.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24223971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":["MTT","ROS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G6PD deficiency","aureus-infected G6PD-deficient cells","wild type cells","impact of bacterial infection","cell infection model","Western blotting analysis of G6PD","A549 lung carcinoma cells","effects of microbial infection","patients","intrinsic pathway","intrinsic apoptotic initiator caspase","stronger apoptotic activity","accumulation of intracellular ROS","lower cell viability","flow cytometry","common pathogen Staphylococcus aureus","confocal fluorescence microscope","acute hemolytic anemia","pentose phosphate pathway","aureus \u03B1-hemolysin","impairment of ROS removal","phosphate dehydrogenase","common clinical manifestations","downstream effector caspase","neonatal jaundice","PI staining","dichlorofluorescein","annexin V","viral infections","key enzyme","scramble controls","Plasmodium","case","higher expression level","energy","intensity","enhanced apoptosis","DCF","signal","subsequent medication","MTT assay","significant increase","redox balance","Glucose","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with bacterial infection is a hallmark of sepsis. Sepsis in neonatal foals is a common sequela of failure of passive transfer and, in addition to development of SIRS, may be characterised by bacteraemia, pneumonia, enterocolitis, omphalophlebitis, meningoencephalitis or arthritis. Sepsis in mature horses is most commonly observed secondary to gastrointestinal lesions that result in disrupted mucosa and bacterial translocation into circulation (endotoxaemia). Pleuropneumonia and metritis may also cause sepsis in mature horses. Diagnosis of sepsis is based on SIRS criteria as well as suspected or confirmed infection. Due to the relatively low sensitivity of microbial culture and the subjectivity of sepsis scoring, many sepsis biomarkers are being studied for their usefulness in diagnosis and prognostication of sepsis in horses. Treatment of sepsis requires an intensive care approach that includes antimicrobial drug administration, fluid resuscitation and pressure support, and treatment for inflammation, endotoxaemia and coagulopathy. Early recognition of sepsis and prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical for a successful outcome. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome may occur in severe cases of sepsis, with common manifestations including laminitis and coagulopathies.

Abstract Objective Respiratory infections require a rapid etiological diagnosis for efficient management of cases. We evaluated multiplex PCR used for the diagnosis and the epidemiological surveillance of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Patients and methods Our study included 278 patients (mean age: 37.2\u00B122.9 years) with flu or flu-like syndromes, consulting physicians affiliated with the GROG Poitou-Charentes or hospitalized in the Poitiers teaching hospital. A multiplex PCR detecting A(H3), A(H1) and B influenza viruses, and RSV A and B, was performed with both a direct examination by immunofluorescence and cell-culture. Results We diagnosed a viral infection in 139 (50.0%) patients: 99 cases of influenza A(H3), 2 cases of influenza A(H1), 28 cases of influenza B and 11 cases of RSV infections. The diagnosis yield in GROG patients (52.3%) was significantly higher than that observed in hospitalized patients (34.5%) (P =0.04). All techniques were correlated in 61% of cases. The multiplex PCR yielded 22.3% more positive samples compared to the conventional techniques. All positive samples by conventional techniques were also positive by multiplex PCR. We observed a perfect correlation between viral types and subtypes determined by PCR and cell-culture. Conclusion Multiplex PCR is a sensitive technique allowing an efficient and rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections due to influenza and RSV.","publish_time":"2007-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plouzeau, C.; Paccalin, M.; Beby-Defaux, A.; Giraudeau, G.; Godet, C.; Agius, G.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43b031fedcb356e63a1902751bb2f4c51804ece0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119120.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X07001527; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X07001527","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Poitiers"],"keyphrases":["PCR multiplex","multiplex PCR detecting","The multiplex PCR yielded","patients du GROG","Conclusion Multiplex PCR is","cases","RSV infections","We evaluated multiplex PCR used","The diagnosis yield in GROG patients","infections respiratoires","infections grippales","to influenza","H3","H1","VRS","influenza viruses","techniques traditionnelles","cas d\u0027infection","cas de grippe","viral infection in","techniques were correlated in","rapid diagnosis","the epidemiological surveillance","hospitalized in the Poitiers teaching hospital","respiratory syncytial virus","virus grippaux","culture cellulaire","more positive samples compared to the conventional techniques","was significantly higher than that observed in hospitalized patients","consulting physicians affiliated with the GROG Poitou-Charentes","Abstract Objective Respiratory infections require","conventional techniques were also positive","We observed","diagnostic efficace","rapid etiological diagnosis","virus respiratoire syncytial","with flu or flu","technique sensible","immunofluorescence","diagnostic \u00E9tiologique","concordance technique","infection virale","consultant des m\u00E9decins vigies du GROG Poitou-Charentes","was performed with both","types viraux d\u00E9termin\u00E9s","Results We diagnosed","sensitive technique allowing an efficient","perfect correlation between viral types","direct examination","efficient management","examen direct","CHU de Poitiers","charge efficace","like syndromes","subtypes determined","methods Our study included","years","mean age","pseudogrippal","\u00E9pid\u00E9miosurveillance","syndrome grippal","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Objectif","parall\u00E8le","prise","\u00E9vidence","\u00E2ge moyen","rapport","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements positifs","gain de positivit\u00E9","rendement diagnostique","\u00E9tude","parfaite corr\u00E9lation","m\u00E9thodes","R\u00E9sultats"],"language":"fr"},

Noroviruses are the number 1 cause of acute gastroenteritis, of foodborne illness, of sporadic gastroenteritis in all age groups and of severe acute gastroenteritis in children less than 5 years old seeking medical assistance [USA/CDC]. In developing countries, noroviruses are linked to significant mortality (\u223C200000 children \u003C5 years old). Noroviruses are a major culprit for the closure of hospital wards, and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality among the elderly. Transplant patients have significant risk of acquiring persistent norovirus gastroenteritis. Control and prevention strategies are limited to the use of disinfectants and hand sanitizers, whose efficacy is frequently insufficient. Hence, there is an ample need for antiviral treatment and prophylaxis of norovirus infections. The fact that only a handful of inhibitors of norovirus replication have been reported can largely be attributable to the hampering inability to cultivate human noroviruses in cell culture. The Norwalk replicon-bearing cells and the murine norovirus-infected cell lines are the available models to assess in vitro antiviral activity of compounds. Human noroviruses have been shown to replicate (to some extent) in mice, calves, gnotobiotic pigs, and chimpanzees. Infection of interferon-deficient mice with the murine norovirus results in virus-induced diarrhea.

However, effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines have yet to be developed for completely curing deadly diseases, such as cancer, malaria, HIV, and serious microbial infections. Thus, suitable vaccine candidates need to be designed to elicit appropriate immune responses. Nanotechnology has been found to play a unique role in the design of vaccines, providing them with enhanced specificity and potency. Nano-scaled materials, such as virus-like particles, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), and protein NPs, have received considerable attention over the past decade as potential carriers for the delivery of vaccine antigens and adjuvants, due to their beneficial advantages, like improved antigen stability, targeted delivery, and long-time release, for which antigens/adjuvants are either encapsulated within, or decorated on, the NP surface. Flexibility in the design of nanomedicine allows for the programming of immune responses, thereby addressing the many challenges encountered in vaccine development. Biomimetic NPs have emerged as innovative natural mimicking biosystems that can be used for a wide range of biomedical applications. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in biomimetic nanovaccines, and their use in anti-bacterial therapy, anti-HIV therapy, anti-malarial therapy, anti-melittin therapy, and anti-tumor immunity.","publish_time":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vijayan, Veena; Mohapatra, Adityanarayan; Uthaman, Saji; Park, In-Kyu","journal":"Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40d1dd0f992de32e06c688811ecc8445826cee20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6835828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615112/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics11100534","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HIV therapy","anti-melittin therapy","anti-malarial therapy","anti-bacterial therapy","Biomimetic NPs","design of vaccines","development of vaccines","vaccine development","anti-tumor immunity","delivery of vaccine antigens","protein NPs","therapeutic vaccines","adjuvants","programming of immune responses","suitable vaccine candidates","appropriate immune responses","targeted delivery","effective control","vital role","biomimetic nanovaccines","unique role","design of nanomedicine","fatal diseases","deadly diseases","improved antigen stability","potential carriers","use","past decade","considerable attention","beneficial advantages","liposomes","long-time release","polymeric nanoparticles","innovative natural mimicking biosystems","virus","recent advances","cancer","serious microbial infections","wide range of biomedical applications","enhanced specificity","challenges","Nano-scaled materials","potency","review","Flexibility","NP surface","Nanotechnology"],"language":"en"},

Specimens were interrogated by multiplex PCR using the ResPlex II assay. Samples positive for HRV were then submitted for genotyping by partial sequence analysis of the 5\u2032 untranslated (UTR) and viral protein (VP) 1 capsid regions. RESULTS: Of 71 screened, 56 residents were positive for a HRV during an outbreak that lasted 5.5 weeks; 27 healthcare workers also had respiratory symptoms. Three residents were transferred to hospital and 2 died. Seven units in two wings of the LTCH were affected, resulting in 3152.5 resident unit closure days. Three different HRV genotypes were identified, although HRV-A1 dominated. CONCLUSIONS: This large outbreak of HRVs among residents and healthcare workers in a LTCH was associated with substantial resident and staff morbidity as well as significant unit closures. Multiple types of HRV were implicated but an HRV-A1 type dominated, warranting further investigation into viral determinants for virulence and transmission.","publish_time":"2013-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mubareka, Samira; Louie, Lisa; Wong, Henry; Granados, Andrea; Chong, Sylvia; Luinstra, Kathy; Petrich, Astrid; Smieja, Marek; Vearncombe, Mary; Mahony, James; Simor, Andrew","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b980feb6620f08f7958009ae3ef0bbc417162f58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185442.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910934/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653213002692; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653213002692; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2013.06.037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","LTCH","ResPlex II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV types","LTCH","residents","HRV-A1 type","HRV-A1 dominated","single type of HRV","Multiple types of HRV","different HRV genotypes","large respiratory outbreak","large outbreak of HRVs","healthcare workers","respiratory symptoms","outbreaks of respiratory illness","viral protein","viral determinants","substantial resident","resident unit closure days","Samples positive","significant unit closures","well-recognized cause of long-term care home","staff morbidity","VP","investigation","molecular epidemiology","cough","rhinitis","multiplex PCR","virulence","UTR","Nasopharyngeal swabs","genotyping","partial sequence analysis","capsid regions","Human rhinoviruses","following","fever","ResPlex","assay","STUDY DESIGN","limited data","transmission","BACKGROUND","weeks","CONCLUSIONS","clinical impact","congestion","Specimens","units","wings","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","hospital"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the two diagnostic assays that targeted respectively on Mp-antibody and Mp-DNA were retrospectively investigated. METHODS: A total of 3146 children were clinically diagnosed to have CAP and were confirmed by chest X-ray during March 2015 to February 2016 in Children\u2019s hospital of Hebei Province (China). Both of the sera and sputum samples were collected in 24 h after their admission. The Mp-antibody was examined by the passive particle agglutination assay and a fourfold or greater increase of antibody titers of paired sera or\u22671:160 titer of single serum was set as the serology positive. Mp-DNA in the sputum samples was tested by a multiplex-PCR method named GeXP assay (multiplex PCR combined with automated capillary electrophoresis). In order to eliminate the false positive results caused by the asymptomatic carriage after infected by M. pneumoniae, the inconsistent samples were tested by the real-time isothermal transcription-mediated RNA amplification assay (SAT). RESULTS: The inter-rated agreement test was performed in 3146 CAP patients, with a highest kappa value in the school-age children as 0.783. There were 6.29% (198/3146) cases showed inconsistent results determined by GeXP and serology assay. All of the 19 GeXP(\u002B)/Serology (\u2212) samples and a randomly chosen 27 from 179 GeXP(\u2212)/Serology (\u002B) samples were tested by SAT assay, and a 97.8% diagnosis agreement was observed between SAT and GeXP assay, but not with the serology assay. In addition, patients who were detected only by serology or only by multiplex-PCR were significantly younger than those with both methods positive (3.0 and 1.5 years vs. 5.0 years, p \u003C 0.01). The Viral-Mp coinfection accounted for 37.0% (97/262), which was more common in winter and spring (p \u003C 0.05) and in the infantile group (p \u003C 0.01), compared to the pure Mp positive ones. CONCLUSION: In some children CAP cases, the Mp laboratory diagnosis was inconsistent between serology and multiplex-PCR assay. Verified by the SAT assay, the GeXP showed a more sensitive and reliable performance compared with the serology assay. Furthermore, employing the multiplex-PCR could provide more information on the associated pathogens for clinical assessment of CAP.

We report data from the electronic checklist that was disseminated to medical professionals from October to December 2014 and identify action needed towards better preparedness levels. FINDINGS: Data from 192 medical professionals (one third from Africa) representing 125 hospitals in 45 countries around the globe were obtained through a specifically developed electronic survey. The survey contained 76 specific questions in 7 major sections: Administrative/operational support; Communications; Education and audit; Human resources, Supplies, Infection Prevention and Control practices and Clinical management of patients. The majority of respondents were infectious disease specialists/infection control consultants/clinical microbiologists (75; 39 %), followed by infection control professionals (59; 31 %) and medical doctors of other specialties (17; 9 %). Nearly all (149; 92 %) were directly involved in Ebola preparedness activities. Whilst, 54 % indicated that their hospital would need to handle suspected and proven Ebola cases, the others would subsequently transfer suspected cases to a specialized centre. CONCLUSION: The results from our survey reveal that the general preparedness levels for management of potentially suspected cases of Ebola virus disease is only partially adequate in hospitals. Hospitals designated for admitting EVD suspected and proven patients had more frequently implemented Infection Control preparedness activities than hospitals that would subsequently transfer potential EVD cases to other centres. Results from this first international survey provide a framework for future efforts to improve hospital preparedness worldwide.

Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments.","publish_time":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jombart, Thibaut; Cori, Anne; Didelot, Xavier; Cauchemez, Simon; Fraser, Christophe; Ferguson, Neil","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48f553c843618f0cc189f9067685f551049a018f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3900386.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sampled disease outbreaks","pathogen sequences","sampled outbreaks","disease outbreak reconstruction","dates of infections","outbreak transmission trees","genetic data","unobserved cases","sampled epidemics","analysis","statistical method","use of pathogen genome sequences","rigorous frameworks","collection dates","previous approaches","imported cases","separate introductions","tool of choice","multiple introductions","Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","likely transmission events","variety of heuristic approaches","inferring numbers of secondary infections","free software","SARS","heterogeneous infectivity","new insights","R package outbreaker","early stage","progress","subsequent methodological developments","analyses","dynamics","beginning","super-spreaders","challenge","Recent years","simulations","generality"],"language":"en"},

In dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), the clinical features of TBDs stem from the depletion of crucial stem cell populations in highly proliferative tissues, resulting from abnormal telomerase function. Due to the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and lack of a conclusive laboratory test it may be challenging to reach a clinical diagnosis, especially if patients lack the pathognomonic clinical features of TBDs. METHODS: Clinical sequencing was performed on a cohort of patients presenting with variable immune phenotypes lacking molecular diagnoses. Hypothesis-free whole-exome sequencing (WES) was selected in the absence of compelling diagnostic hints in patients with variable immunological and haematological conditions. RESULTS: In four patients belonging to three families, we have detected five novel variants in known TBD-causing genes (DKC1, TERT and RTEL1). In addition to the molecular findings, they all presented shortened blood cell telomeres. These findings are consistent with the displayed TBD phenotypes, addressing towards the molecular diagnosis and subsequent clinical follow-up of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly support the utility of WES-based approaches for routine genetic diagnostics of TBD patients with heterogeneous or atypical clinical presentation who otherwise might remain undiagnosed.

In theory, sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs may be achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays which utilize primers of defined polarity during the RT step. However, in practice, it has been shown that such assays are prone to artifacts, such as non-specific priming, which drastically diminish their reliability. Using murine coronavirus MHV-4 as a model, we describe and validate several modifications of the RT-PCR procedure which eliminate these artifacts. Key RT-PCR parameters which were optimized include the design of tagged primers, DNase treatment of in vitro transcribed RNA standards, specification of temperature differences between RT and PCR annealing steps, and use of competitive RNA templates for quantitative assays. The assays described may be used to determine the sense and abundance of any viral or host RNA of interest in complex biological specimens.","publish_time":"1999-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schoenike, Barry; Franta, Amy K.; Fleming, John O.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca1a69ee197dec6b6bb23168cc6897249c234d52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119510.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093498001670; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093498001670","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR procedure","RT step","Key RT-PCR parameters","quantitative assays","host RNA","PCR annealing steps","viral RNAs present","sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs","artifacts","transcribed RNA standards","competitive RNA templates","primers of defined polarity","design of tagged primers","specification of temperature differences","DNase treatment of","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","abundance","complex biological specimens","non-specific priming","theory","sample","modifications","murine coronavirus MHV","applications","model","Abstract","reliability","practice"],"language":"en"},

During a large-scale outbreak, it is important that the public follows preventive advice. To increase compliance, insight in how the public gathers its knowledge and which factors determine whether or not an individual complies with preventive advice is crucial. METHODS: In 2012, contaminated salmon caused a large Salmonella Thompson outbreak in the Netherlands. During the outbreak, we conducted an online survey (n = 1,057) to assess the general public\u2019s perceptions, knowledge, preventive behavior and sources of information. RESULTS: Respondents perceived Salmonella infections and the 2012 outbreak as severe (m = 4.21; five-point scale with 5 as severe). Their knowledge regarding common food sources, the incubation period and regular treatment of Salmonella (gastro-enteritis) was relatively low (e.g., only 28.7% knew that Salmonella is not normally treated with antibiotics). Preventive behavior differed widely, and the majority (64.7%) did not check for contaminated salmon at home. Most information about the outbreak was gathered through traditional media and news and newspaper websites. This was mostly determined by time spent on the medium. Social media played a marginal role. Wikipedia seemed a potentially important source of information. CONCLUSIONS: To persuade the public to take preventive actions, public health organizations should deliver their message primarily through mass media. Wikipedia seems a promising instrument for educating the public about food-borne Salmonella.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Velsen, Lex; Beaujean, Desir\u00E9e JMA; van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia EWC; van Steenbergen, Jim E; Timen, Aura","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/347209baac4ddbcc1533979d1a496128d7834f5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3913330.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479614/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Salmonella infections","preventive behavior","preventive advice","large Salmonella Thompson outbreak","preventive actions","knowledge","large-scale outbreak","regular treatment of Salmonella","sources of information","public health organizations","common food sources","traditional media","contaminated salmon","Social media","mass media","important source of information","Wikipedia","incubation period","message","general public\u2019s perceptions","newspaper websites","gastro-enteritis","individual","Netherlands","promising instrument","marginal role","online survey","worldwide concern","RESULTS","Respondents","factors","BACKGROUND","METHODS","home","compliance","insight","time","majority","CONCLUSIONS","antibiotics"],"language":"en"},

Although most acute RTI are thought to be of viral origin, viral etiology is still unknown in a significant number of cases. OBJECTIVES: Multiplexed whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used for virome determination directly on clinical samples as proof of principle for the use of deep sequencing techniques in clinical diagnosis of viral infections. STUDY DESIGN: WGS was performed with nucleic acids from sputum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from four pediatric patients with known respiratory tract infections (two patients with human rhinovirus, one patient with human metapneumovirus and one patient with respiratory syncytial virus), and from four pediatric patients with PCR-negative RTI, and two control samples. RESULTS: Viral infections detected by routine molecular diagnostic methods were confirmed by WGS; in addition, typing information of the different viruses was generated. In three out of four samples from pediatric patients with PCR-negative respiratory tract infections and the two control samples, no causative viral pathogens could be detected. In one sample from a patient with PCR-negative RTI, rhinovirus type-C was detected. Almost complete viral genomes could be assembled and in all cases virus species could be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, in a single run, viral pathogens can be detected and characterized, providing information for clinical assessment and epidemiological studies. We conclude that WGS is a powerful tool in clinical virology that delivers comprehensive information on the viral content of clinical samples.","publish_time":"2015-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zoll, Jan; Rahamat-Langendoen, Janette; Ahout, Inge; Jonge, Marien I.de; Jans, Jop; Huijnen, Martijn A.; Ferwerda, Gerben; Warris, Adilia; Melchers, Willem J.G.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e65cf533f2368093200d0c01906157e2294372d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185507.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321500058X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.02.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321500058X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25866327/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WGS","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical diagnosis of viral infections","viral content of clinical samples","viral etiology","viral origin","pediatric patients","WGS","PCR-negative respiratory tract infections","causative viral pathogens","Acute respiratory tract infections","control samples","PCR-negative RTI","known respiratory tract infections","complete viral genomes","clinical virology","clinical assessment","acute RTI","respiratory syncytial virus","human rhinovirus","comprehensive information","majority of pediatric infectious diseases","cases virus species","human metapneumovirus","genome sequencing","STUDY DESIGN","rhinovirus type-C","significant number of cases","use of deep sequencing techniques","nasopharyngeal aspirates","cause substantial morbidity","routine molecular diagnostic methods","nucleic acids","proof of principle","sputum","childhood","powerful tool","virome determination","epidemiological studies","BACKGROUND","single run","OBJECTIVES","addition","RESULTS","different viruses","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The real-time estimation involves a number of important statistical problems to consider, and this chapter comprehensively describes commonly used estimation methods and their pitfalls. When estimating the case fatality risk (CFR) during the course of an epidemic, the data are right-censored because of the time delay from illness onset to death. A conventional survival analysis technique is employed for addressing right censoring. Identification of risk factors of death also requires the care for censored nature of the data, and we have devised a method that combines the survival analysis and logistic regression. Ascertainment bias is always a practical issue in interpreting the absolute value of the CFR or comparing CFR between different groups, and recent studies have shown that observational effort including seroepidemiological survey has to be made to overcome this bias.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"Handbook of Statistics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/407d0624c819defbf98c4991b5e8f7c03e5b88fa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169716117300020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169716117300020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of death","CFR","Identification of risk factors of death","case fatality risk","course","epidemic","data","conventional survival analysis technique","real-time estimation","censored nature","Ascertainment bias","right censoring","used estimation methods","utmost importance","public health assessment","recent studies","observational effort","practical issue","different groups","care","number of important statistical problems","absolute value","chapter","time delay","illness onset","severity of infection","seroepidemiological survey","pitfalls","logistic regression","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

To achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using NimbleGen tiling arrays. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that SS2 isolates have highly divergent genomes. The 89K pathogenicity island (PAI), which has been previously recognized as unique to the Chinese epidemic strains causing STSS, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS. Moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator RevS and CtsR. On the basis of analysis of regions of differences (RDs) across the entire genome for the 18 selected SS2 strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is proposed, which provides clues into Streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89K PAI present in the genome of SS2 strains revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to STSS, which may lead to better environmental monitoring of epidemic SS2 strains.","publish_time":"2011-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Zuowei; Li, Ming; Wang, Changjun; Li, Jing; Lu, Na; Zhang, Ruifen; Jiang, Yongqiang; Yang, Ruifu; Liu, Cuihua; Liao, Hui; Gao, George F; Tang, Jiaqi; Zhu, Baoli","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c5521b73b11d4e229b4ca98f116bc32aa4052c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3118785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21554741/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-12-219","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STSS","PAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome of SS2 strains","selected SS2 strains","avirulent strains","evolution of SS2","SS2 isolates","Chinese epidemic strains","better environmental monitoring of epidemic SS2 strains","basis of analysis","Streptococcus pathogenicity","deep comparative genomic analysis","entire genome","genome level","basis of virulence","genes","catastrophic features of STSS","pathogenicity island","RESULTS","virulence factors","better understanding","PAI present","pilus-associated proteins","specific Streptococcus suis serotype","new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome","sortases","RDs","response regulator RevS","details","previous studies","geographic origin","regions of differences","model of microevolution","lipase","PlcR","candidate","CONCLUSIONS","clues","ABC-type transport systems","NimbleGen tiling arrays","CtsR","divergent genomes","BACKGROUND","polymorphisms"],"language":"en"},

However, the therapeutic efficiency is unsatisfactory, particularly in East Asia. Such inefficiency might be a result of the short half\u2010life, relatively low local concentration and strong side\u2010effects of interferons. Frequent and repeated injection is also a big burden for patients. In the present study, a single dose of vector\u2010delivered IFN\u03B11 was tested for its anti\u2010HBV effects. METHODS: Adeno\u2010associated viral vector (AAV\u2010IFN\u03B11) was generated to deliver the IFN\u03B11 gene into hepatocytes. IFN\u03B11, hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) and e (HBeAg) antigens were measured by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay and/or western blotting. The level of viral DNA was measured by quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: AAV\u2010IFN\u03B11 effectively transduced HBV\u2010producing cells (HepAD38) and mouse hepatocytes, where IFN\u03B11 was expressed in a stable manner. Both intracellular and extracellular HBsAg and HBeAg were significantly reduced in vitro. In the HBV\u2010producing mice, the concentration of IFN\u03B11 in the liver was eight\u2010fold higher than that in plasma. Compared with control groups, HBeAg/HBsAg antigen levels were reduced by more than ten\u2010fold from day 1\u20135, and dropped to an undetectable level on day 9 in the AAV\u2010IFN\u03B11 group. Concurrently, the level of viral DNA decreased over 30\u2010fold for several weeks. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose administration of AAV\u2010IFN\u03B11 viral vector displayed prolonged transgene expression and superior antiviral effects both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the use of AAV\u2010IFN\u03B11 might be a potential alternative strategy for anti\u2010HBV therapy.

Two hundred units of alpha/beta interferon were administered intranasally to BALB/cByJ mice daily over a five day period. The mice were exposed intranasally to 103 median tissue culture infectious doses of MHV-JHM on the third day of interferon treatment. Two days after virus exposure, the proportion of mice with MHV in nasal turbinates was reduced from 10 of 10 in the untreated group to 7 of 10 in the interferon-treated group, and mean titers in virus-containing noses were lower in the interferon-treated group. Five days after virus exposure, the proportion of mice with infectious virus in the brain was significantly lower in the interferon-treated group (1 of 10 mice) than in the untreated group (10 of 10 mice). Systemic infection, as measured by presence and concentration of virus in the spleen, was not affected by intranasal interferon treatment. These results suggest that intranasally administered interferon protects against local extension of MHV-JHM from nose to brain, but not against dissemination of virus to other organs, such as the spleen.","publish_time":"1987-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Abigail L.; Barthold, Stephen W.; Beck, Deborah S.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354287800025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354287800025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BALB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interferon-treated group","infectious virus","virus exposure","intranasally administered interferon","proportion of mice","cByJ mice","concentration of virus","dissemination of virus","MHV-JHM","intranasal interferon treatment","day of interferon treatment","untreated group","mouse hepatitis virus","beta interferon blocked extension","strain JHM","brain of BALB","Summary Intranasally","local extension of MHV","days","spleen","median tissue culture infectious doses of MHV","intranasal inoculation","units of alpha","day period","coronavirus","mean titers","noses","presence","nasal turbinates","organs","results","Systemic infection"],"language":"en"},

To inform HCPs, public health issues PHEPR messages that provide guidelines and updates, and facilitate surveillance so HCPs will recognize and control communicable diseases, prevent excess deaths and mitigate suffering. Public health agencies need to know that the PHEPR messages sent to HCPs reach their target audience and are effective and informative. Public health agencies need to know that the PHEPR messages sent to HCPs reach their target audience and are effective and informative. We conducted a literature review to investigate the systems and tools used by public health to generate PHEPR communications to HCPs, and to identify specific characteristics of message delivery mechanisms and formats that may be associated with effective PHEPR communications. METHODS: A systematic review of peer- and non-peer-reviewed literature focused on the following questions: 1) What public health systems exist for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs? 2) Have these systems been evaluated and, if yes, what criteria were used to evaluate these systems? 3) What have these evaluations discovered about characterizations of the most effective ways for public health agencies to communicate PHEPR messages to HCPs? RESULTS: We identified 25 systems or tools for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs. Few articles assessed PHEPR communication systems or messaging methods or outcomes. Only one study compared the effectiveness of the delivery format, device or message itself. We also discovered that the potential is high for HCPs to experience \u0022message overload\u0022 given redundancy of PHEPR messaging in multiple formats and/or through different delivery systems. CONCLUSIONS: We found that detailed descriptions of PHEPR messaging from public health to HCPs are scarce in the literature and, even when available are rarely evaluated in any systematic fashion. To meet present-day and future information needs for emergency preparedness, more attention needs to be given to evaluating the effectiveness of these systems in a scientifically rigorous manner.","publish_time":"2011-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Revere, Debra; Nelson, Kailey; Thiede, Hanne; Duchin, Jeffrey; Stergachis, Andy; Baseman, Janet","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db7db8941a68a14e0b227ce42898ad4ecd40df62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3121631.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21592390/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-337","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCPs","public health systems","Public health agencies","public health issues PHEPR messages","PHEPR communication systems","public health emergency preparedness","aware of public health threats","effective PHEPR communications","redundancy of PHEPR messaging","Health care providers","detailed descriptions of PHEPR messaging","different delivery systems","messaging methods","effective ways","literature review","message overload","target audience","delivery format","systematic review of peer","tools","effectiveness","specific characteristics of message delivery mechanisms","non-peer-reviewed literature","multiple formats","systematic fashion","future information needs","important role","experience","guidelines","control communicable diseases","excess deaths","updates","response","following questions","surveillance","device","outcomes","BACKGROUND","emergencies","articles","characterizations","attention","potential","suffering","CONCLUSIONS","study","rigorous manner","evaluations","criteria","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

While the studies in the former context are intensively expanded, the latter remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the pattern formation of an interacting contagion, where two infections, A and B, interact with each other and diffuse simultaneously in space. The contagion process for each follows the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible kinetics, and their interaction introduces a potential change in the secondary infection propensity compared to the baseline reproduction number [Formula: see text]. We show that the nontrivial spatial infection patterns arise when the susceptible individuals move faster than the infected and the interaction between the two infections is neither too competitive nor too cooperative. Interestingly, the system exhibits pattern hysteresis phenomena, i.e., quite different parameter regions for patterns exist in the direction of increasing or decreasing [Formula: see text]. Decreasing [Formula: see text] reveals remarkable enhancement in contagion prevalence, meaning that the eradication becomes difficult compared to the single-infection or coinfection without space. Linearization analysis supports our observations, and we have identified the required elements and dynamical mechanism, which suggests that these patterns are essentially Turing patterns. Our work thus reveals new complexities in interacting contagions and paves the way for further investigation because of its relevance to both biological and social contexts.","publish_time":"2019-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Li","journal":"Physical review.

For this purpose, 21 and 48 street dust samples were collected for TPH analysis and PAH analysis, respectively, in Asaluyeh County. Moreover, seven air dust samples were taken for PAH analysis. TPH concentrations ranged between 240 and 4400 mg kg(\u22121), with a mean of 1371.43 mg kg(\u22121). The maximum \u2211PAH concentration (6016.3 mg kg(\u22121)) was detected in a petrochemical complex while the minimum \u2211PAHs content (16.93 mg kg(\u22121)) was measured in an urban area. The mean concentrations of total PAHs in street dust particles were 491.35 mg kg(\u22121) in summer and 304.04 mg kg(\u22121) in winter. The results indicated that PAH concentration in summer was higher. PAH sources were identified using both PAHs ratios and robust statistical methods such as Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), backward GEE, logistic regression, principal components analysis (PCA) in conjunction with multiple linear regression (MLR) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The results showed that PAH species generally originate from pyrogenic sources and about 0.08% of TPH was typically PAHs. However, petrogenic sources of PAHs in the industrial areas were 11.2 times more abundant than in urban areas. Also, backward GEE model demonstrated that TPH is more influenced by HMW PAHs, particularly indene. Estimated incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was higher than 10(-4), showing that Asaluyeh inhabitants (especially children and indoor workers) are probably exposed to cancer risk, particularly through dermal contact and dust ingestion.","publish_time":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abbasi, Sajjad; Keshavarzi, Behnam","journal":"Sustain Cities Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363135/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670718312198; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2018.11.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670718312198","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TPH","PAH","GEE"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["TPH analysis","PAH analysis","PAHs ratios","HMW PAHs","PAHs content","PAH sources","petrogenic sources of PAHs","TPH concentrations","PAH concentration","street dust samples","suspended dust","dust ingestion","mean concentrations of total PAHs","urban areas","PAH species","street dust particles","air dust samples","urban environment","principal components analysis","backward GEE model","industrial areas","pyrogenic sources","Iran","results","summer","Total petroleum hydrocarbons","important petrochemical center","logistic regression","important pollutants","incremental lifetime cancer risk","petrochemical complex","Asaluyeh inhabitants","Asaluyeh County","multiple linear regression","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","MLR","conjunction","PCA","robust statistical methods","Generalized Estimating Equations","positive matrix factorization","ILCR","toxicity level","dermal contact","public health","times","children","indoor workers","minimum","oil-rich countries","PMF","indene","relationship","maximum","purpose","winter"],"language":"en"},

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. Methods:In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. Results:The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. Conclusions:As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira, Rodolfo M.; Bertolini, Diego; Teixeira, Lucas O.; Silla, Carlos N.; Costa, Yandre M.G.","journal":"Comput Methods Programs Biomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7b262f9564eebef3810b9a4a185b74a3291df61.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ae80fe12be5b66d621401a3bb005769f784f52cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207172.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260720309664?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260720309664; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105532; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05835v3.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32446037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","CXR","CNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CXR images of pneumonia","order","types of pneumonia","proposed approach","hierarchical classification scenario","novel proposed hierarchical classification approach","CXR images of healthy lungs","best COVID","severe pneumonia","multi-class classification","classification schema extract features","identification rate","multi-class approach","main visual attributes of CXR images","different pathogens","classes distribution","well-known texture descriptors","best nominal rate","Early diagnosis","CT scan","RYDLS","recognition rate","healthcare system","strength of multiple texture descriptors","standard image diagnosis tests","gold standard","macro-avg F1-Score","real-world scenario","chest X-ray","computed tomography","correct treatment","paper","re-balance","task","base classifiers","following perspectives","domain","use of resampling algorithms","pre-trained CNN model","late fusion techniques","unbalanced environment","natural data imbalance","high impact","Abstract Background","stress","database","Results","objectives","Methods","study","hierarchy","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The pattern of infection in the population was investigated using a serial cross-sectional serological study over a 25-month period, with blood sampled from 521 individuals over six sampling sessions. Antibody titres to the virus were determined by virus neutralisation test. In contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern, we observed that seroprevalence gradually increased over the two years suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period. Our results suggested age, pregnancy and lactation were significant risk factors for a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Antibody titres were significantly higher in females than males, with the highest titres occurring in pregnant animals. Temporal variation in antibody titres suggests that herd immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings support an endemic infection pattern of henipaviruses in bat populations suggesting their infection dynamics may differ significantly from the acute, self limiting episodic pattern observed with related viruses (e.g. measles virus, phocine distemper virus, rinderpest virus) hence requiring a much smaller critical host population size to sustain the virus.

FIP is characterized by the overexpression of an acute phase protein, the \u03B11-acid glycoprotein (AGP). In humans, AGP is a heavily glycosylated protein that undergoes several modifications of its glycan moiety during acute and chronic inflammatory pathologies. We studied the changes in AGP glycosylation in the course of FIP. Specifically, we focussed our attention on the degree of sialylation, fucosylation and branching. This study presents a purification method for feline AGP (fAGP) from serum, using an ion exchange chromatography strategy. The glycosylation pattern was analyzed in detail by means of interaction of purified fAGP with specific lectins. In particular, Sambucus nigra agglutinin I and Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectins were used to detect sialic acid residues, Aleuria aurantia lectin was used to detect l-fucose residues and Concanavalin A was used to evaluate the branching degree. By this method we showed that fAGP did not present any l-fucose residues on its surface, and that its branching degree was very low, both in normal and in pathological conditions. In contrast, during FIP disease, fAGP underwent several modifications in the sialic acid content, including decreased expression of both \u03B1(2\u20136)-linked and \u03B1(2\u20133)-linked sialic acid (76 and 44%, respectively when compared to non-pathological feline AGP).","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ceciliani, Fabrizio; Grossi, Claudia; Giordano, Alessia; Pocacqua, Vanessa; Paltrinieri, Saverio","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a38709604615834482efa80d458501515cf21ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120068.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704000522; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704000522","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP","AGP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AGP glycosylation","sialic acid residues","FIP disease","non-pathological feline AGP","branching degree","sialic acid content","feline coronavirus","course of FIP","fucose residues","modifications","\u03B11-acid glycoprotein","interaction of purified fAGP","degree of sialylation","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis","acute phase protein","Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectins","specific lectins","glycosylated protein","purification method","pathological conditions","glycosylation pattern","Sambucus nigra agglutinin","immune-mediated disease of domestic","exotic felides","serum","glycan moiety","decreased expression","Aleuria aurantia lectin","chronic inflammatory pathologies","overexpression","ion exchange chromatography strategy","surface","study","fucosylation","changes","contrast","attention","humans","Concanavalin"],"language":"en"},

Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 interacts rapidly and strongly with IFIT3 forming a stable heterotetramer. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that associates with IFIT1, forming an IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 trimer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a C-terminal \u2018YxxxL\u2019 motif in IFIT1 that mediates its association with IFIT3. Using various reporter mRNAs, we demonstrate for the first time that IFIT3 stabilises IFIT1 binding to cap0-mRNA and enhances its translation inhibition activity. Disrupting the binding interface between IFIT1 and IFIT3 abrogated this enhancement. This work reveals molecular aspects of IFIT assembly and provides an important \u2018missing link\u2019 between IFIT interaction and function.","publish_time":"2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fleith, Renata C; Mears, Harriet V; Emmott, Edward; Graham, Stephen C; Mansur, Daniel S; Sweeney, Trevor R","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d98a73314cd9f923aaa367f3f4de056b8cedec5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1cd124396df14096bce433959e8808a124791a0d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/261776","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFIT1 binding","IFIT3 homodimers","IFIT3 trimer","different complexes of IFIT1","IFIT interaction","IFIT2","molecular aspects of IFIT assembly","molecular basis of IFIT association","binding interface","critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly","Interaction of different IFIT family members","function","translation inhibition activity","eukaryotic translation initiation factor","S recruitment","stable heterotetramer","stable heterodimer","non-self cap structures","cap0-mRNA","tetratricopeptide repeats","C-terminal","motif","missing link","cell-intrinsic immune response","Interferon-induced proteins","viral infection","IFITs","YxxxL","impact","work","end of foreign RNAs","mutagenesis","time","various reporter mRNAs","Site","enhancement"],"language":"en"},

Humoral (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) and cellular (by cell proliferation and CD4\u002B:CD8\u002B assay) immunity was detected by using recombinant N1 and N3 specific antigen. Results showed that N1 and N3 fragments of N protein expressed by E. coli were able to react with sera of SARS patients but N2 could not. Specific humoral and cellular immunity in mice could be induced significantly by inoculating SARS-CoV N1 and N3 DNA vaccine. In addition, the immune response levels in N3 were significantly higher for antibody responses (IgG and IgG1 but not IgG2a) and cell proliferation but not in CD4\u002B:CD8\u002B assay compared to N1 vaccine. The identification of antigenic N protein fragments has implications to provide basic information for the design of DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV. The present results not only suggest that DNA immunization with pVax-N3 could be used as potential DNA vaccination approaches to induce antibody in BALB/c mice, but also illustrates that gene immunization with these SARS DNA vaccines can generate different immune responses.","publish_time":"2008-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dutta, Noton Kumar; Mazumdar, Kaushiki; Lee, Byoung-Hee; Baek, Min-Won; Kim, Dong-Jae; Na, Yi-Rang; Park, Sung-Hoon; Lee, Hyun-Kyoung; Kariwa, Hiroaki; Mai, Le Quynh; Park, Jae-Hak","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f6397ff2cc785076b76b648693ac358b60da6ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112843.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2008.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247808000874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18440652/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247808000874","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-N","SARS-CoV N1","N3 DNA vaccine","N protein of SARS","N1 vaccine","N3 fragments of N protein","pVax-N3","SARS DNA vaccines","sera of SARS patients","N3 specific antigen","recombinant N1","proteins of N1","N2","design of DNA vaccine","DNA immunization","identification of antigenic N protein fragments","vaccine design","gene fragments","residues","pooled sera of convalescence phase of SARS patients","nucleocapsid protein","c mice","potential DNA vaccination approaches","antibody responses","cellular immunity","CD4","CD8","cell proliferation","BALB","gene immunization","different immune responses","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Escherichia coli","present results","immune response levels","promising antigen candidates","severe acute respiratory syndrome","ELISA","implications","basic information","IgG1","IgG2a","addition","electroporation","study"],"language":"en"},

Given that meningitis can be fatal and many meningitis cases occurred in high-poverty areas, a simple, low-cost, highly sensitive method is in great need for immediate and early diagnosis of meningitis. Herein, we report a versatile and cost-effective polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/paper hybrid microfluidic device integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the rapid, sensitive, and instrument-free detection of the main meningitis-causing bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis). The introduction of paper into the microfluidic device for LAMP reactions enables stable test results over a much longer period of time than a paper-free microfluidic system. This hybrid system also offers versatile functions, by providing not only on-site qualitative diagnostic analysis (i.e., a yes or no answer), but also confirmatory testing and quantitative analysis in laboratory settings. The limit of detection of N. meningitidis is about 3 copies per LAMP zone within 45 min, close to single-bacterium detection sensitivity. In addition, we have achieved simple pathogenic microorganism detection without a laborious sample preparation process and without the use of centrifuges. This low-cost hybrid microfluidic system provides a simple and highly sensitive approach for fast instrument-free diagnosis of N. meningitidis in resource-limited settings.

Nevertheless, the incidence of both acute and persisting viral infections without evidence of autoimmune sequelae suggests that this process is well controlled. The conditions promoting or stemming self-reactive (SR) T cells following viral-induced tissue damage thus need to be better defined. Using a non-fatal viral mouse model of encephalomyelitis associated with demyelination and disability, yet ultimate clinical improvement, this study set out to monitor uptake and presentation of endogenous myelin antigens, as well as induction and fate of SR T cells. METHODS: Activation and central nervous system (CNS) recruitment of myelin-specific CD4 T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry during encephalomyelitis induced by a glia tropic murine coronavirus. Potential antigen-presenting cells (APC) ingesting myelin were characterized by flow cytometry and their ability to activate SR T cells tested by co-culture with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled myelin-specific CD4 T cells. Endogenous SR T cell kinetics was analyzed within both cervical lymph nodes and CNS by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) following viral infection. RESULTS: The data demonstrate the presence of APC capable of activating SR T cells in both draining lymph nodes and the CNS temporally correlating with overt demyelination. While both the CNS-infiltrating myeloid population and microglia ingested myelin, only CNS-infiltrating APC were capable of presenting endogenous myelin antigen to SR T cells ex vivo. Finally, SR T cell activation from the endogenous T cell repertoire was most notable when infectious virus was controlled and paralleled myelin damage. Although SR T cell accumulation peaked in the persistently infected CNS during maximal demyelination, they were not preferentially retained. Their gradual decline, despite ongoing demyelination, suggested minimal re-stimulation and pathogenic function in vivo consistent with the lack of autoimmune symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the potential for CNS tissue destruction to induce and recruit SR T cells to the injury site and support a host suppressive mechanism limiting development of autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2015-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Gaignage, Melanie; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/055bc4fbdbbe262da7684e89ea4cfcc154a42291.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4642610.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559484/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0426-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APC","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recruit SR T cells","SR T cells ex","fate of SR T cells","SR T cell activation","SR T cell accumulation","myelin-specific CD4 T cells","Endogenous SR T cell kinetics","presence of APC capable of activating SR T cells","endogenous T cell repertoire","recruitment of myelin","infected CNS","CNS-infiltrating APC","CNS tissue destruction","paralleled myelin damage","presentation of endogenous myelin antigens","microglia ingested myelin","viral infections","ongoing demyelination","viral-induced tissue damage","maximal demyelination","overt demyelination","Potential antigen","flow cytometry","RESULTS","non-fatal viral mouse model of encephalomyelitis","draining lymph nodes","cervical lymph nodes","severity of autoimmune diseases","evidence of autoimmune sequelae","lack of autoimmune symptoms","Microbial infections","co-culture","injury site","minimal re-stimulation","central nervous system","Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot","pathogenic function","demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis","CFSE","infectious virus","host suppressive mechanism","carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester","induction","ELISPOT","initiating","disability","uptake","myeloid population","ultimate clinical improvement","development of autoimmunity","study","glia tropic murine coronavirus","METHODS","data","gradual decline","process","BACKGROUND","incidence","CONCLUSIONS","conditions"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The effect of BTE both on A549 and Vero cultured cells and on HSV-1 was assessed by using phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy, and cell viability and proliferation assays. After establishing the maximum non-cytotoxic concentration of BTE, A549 and Vero cells and HSV-1 virions were treated with varying concentrations of BTE, respectively. A549 and Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) insert at the UL46 gene. The effect of infectivity was determined by viral DNA extraction followed by PCR, plaque assays, adsorption assays, and electrophoresis of PCR products. RESULTS: BTE was not cytotoxic to A549 and Vero cells, as confirmed by cell viability and proliferation assays, in which BTE treated groups paralleled the positive control group. For both cell lines, plaque assays and fluorescent microscopy indicated an inverse relationship between BTE concentration (from 0.14 \u03BCM \u2013 1.4 mM) and HSV-1 infectivity. Specifically, PCR and electrophoresis showed a reduction in the viral genome following treatment with BTE. In addition, there was a noticeable decrease in the amount of viral plaques for BTE treated samples in the adsorption assays. CONCLUSIONS: BTE consisting primarily of theaflavins is not cytotoxic and can reduce or block the production of infectious HSV-1 virions in cultured A549 and Vero cells, thus inhibiting the infectivity of the virus by interfering in the attachment, penetration and viral DNA replication of HSV-1 particles. These findings indicate that BTE enriched with theaflavins has the potential to be developed as a safe, therapeutic antiviral agent to prevent the spread of HSV-1.","publish_time":"2013-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cantatore, Anthony; Randall, Sade D; Traum, Daniel; Adams, Sandra D","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4771e9bbc00e3937638507817289579abc270bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3698045.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23777309/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-13-139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero","BTE","PCR","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BTE concentration","effect of BTE","Vero cells","Vero cultured cells","cultured A549","spread of HSV","varying concentrations of BTE","plaque assays","adsorption assays","proliferation assays","viral DNA replication of HSV","maximum non-cytotoxic concentration of BTE","production of infectious HSV","theaflavins","fluorescent microscopy","viral genome","viral plaques","cell viability","effect of infectivity","viral DNA extraction","virions","cell lines","electrophoresis of PCR products","green fluorescent protein","herpes simplex virus type","inverse relationship","GFP","attachment","reduction","groups","penetration","infection","samples","therapeutic antiviral agent","investigation","treatment","positive control group","black tea extract","noticeable decrease","phase contrast","flavanol compounds","particles","potential","\u03BCM","BACKGROUND","purpose","UL46 gene","addition","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","findings","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Reducing the number of dependents in the social security system and maintaining a dynamic economically active population is a high priority concern for policymakers. A good understanding of the dynamics of the social security system\u2014specifically, who enters and who exits the system\u2014would be helpful for formulating effective interventions. Here, we made use of the data of Hong Kong\u2019s Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), which is currently a basic welfare scheme in Hong Kong that provides supplementary payments to households that cannot support themselves financially. We proposed a stochastic model to examine the in- and out- movement in the CSSA scheme and conducted elasticity analyses. The elasticity analyses allowed us to identify the potential target groups of people that would lead to the largest reduction in the number of the CSSA recipients in the system. This analytical method can also reveal whether policies would be more effective in preventing people from entering the CSSA system or helping them leave the CSSA scheme. Our analyses suggest that targeting those aged 30\u201349 with children would have the largest impact. Additionally, we found that policies that aim to prevent this group from entering the CSSA system would be more effective in reducing the number of CSSA recipients compared with policies that aim to help them exit. In contrast, for the younger age group of 10\u201329, policies that help them leave CSSA would be more effective than policies that prevent them from entering CSSA. Providing employment for those unemployed in this younger group would be more effective. The results indicate that by tailoring measures to specific subgroups, the overall number of CSSA recipients would be reduced, thereby improving the efficiency of Hong Kong\u2019s social security system, which has accounted for more than 16.5% of Hong Kong government expenditure in 2018, amounting to more than HKD 92 billion.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yip, Paul; Chen, Mengni; So, Bing Kwan; Lam, Kwok Fai; Wat, Kam Pui","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/131276fce5681acc1232981163627299ba9d662c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068389.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085532/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041305","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSSA","HKD"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["CSSA system","CSSA scheme","policies","overall number of CSSA recipients","efficiency of Hong Kong\u2019s social security system","effective interventions","data of Hong Kong\u2019s Comprehensive Social Security Assistance","number of dependents","younger group","elasticity analyses","Hong Kong government expenditure","younger age group","basic welfare scheme","active population","major expenditure","largest reduction","largest impact","potential target groups of people","high priority concern","need","dynamics","specific subgroups","supplementary payments","measures","policymakers","children","households","contrast","good understanding","governments","employment","analytical method","movement","stochastic model","results","HKD"],"language":"en"},

Pathogens\u0027 proteins may act as dummy ligands, decoy receptors, or via interactome interference. Many such proteins are immunogenic suggesting that antibody mediated knockdown of multiple schizophrenia gene products could contribute to the disease, explaining the immune activation in the brain and lymphocytes in schizophrenia, and the preponderance of immune-related gene variants in the schizophrenia genome.

Together with toroviruses, arteriviruses, and roniviruses the coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales. So far antivirals are hardly available to combat infections with viruses of this order. Therefore, various antiviral strategies to counter nidoviral infections are under evaluation. Lectins, which bind to N-linked oligosaccharide elements of enveloped viruses, can be considered as a conceptionally new class of virus inhibitors. These agents were recently evaluated for their antiviral activity towards a variety of enveloped viruses and were shown in most cases to inhibit virus infection at low concentrations. However, limited knowledge is available for their efficacy towards nidoviruses. In this article the application of the plant lectins Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cymbidium sp. agglutinin (CA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) as well as non-plant derived pradimicin-A (PRM-A) and cyanovirin-N (CV-N) as potential antiviral agents was evaluated. Three antiviral tests were compared based on different evaluation principles: cell viability (MTT-based colorimetric assay), number of infected cells (immunoperoxidase assay) and amount of viral protein expression (luciferase-based assay). The presence of carbohydrate-binding agents strongly inhibited coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, feline coronaviruses serotypes I and II, mouse hepatitis virus), arteriviruses (equine arteritis virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) and torovirus (equine Berne virus). Remarkably, serotype II feline coronaviruses and arteriviruses were not inhibited by PRM-A, in contrast to the other viruses tested.","publish_time":"2007-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Meer, F.J.U.M.; de Haan, C.A.M.; Schuurman, N.M.P.; Haijema, B.J.; Peumans, W.J.; Van Damme, E.J.M.; Delputte, P.L.; Balzarini, J.; Egberink, H.F.","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54440a66bfd06044fbfdf583650fbc4cebf21241.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132385.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354207003245; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354207003245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","feline coronaviruses","inhibited coronaviruses","equine arteritis virus","equine Berne virus","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","infectious bronchitis virus","reproductive syndrome virus","mouse hepatitis virus","arteriviruses","emergence of new human coronaviruses","potential antiviral agents","conceptionally new class of virus inhibitors","antiviral activity","antiviral tests","luciferase-based assay","variety of enveloped viruses","colorimetric assay","Galanthus nivalis agglutinin","plant lectins Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin","immunoperoxidase assay","Urtica dioica agglutinin","CV-N","cyanovirin-N","binding agents","N-linked oligosaccharide elements of enveloped viruses","various antiviral strategies","PRM","important human","nidoviral infections","order Nidovirales","different evaluation principles","non-plant derived pradimicin","HHA","cell viability","SARS-CoV","MTT","number of infected cells","viral protein expression","application","UDA","animal pathogens","Cymbidium","GNA","efficacy","HKU1","presence of carbohydrate","cases","roniviruses","low concentrations","NL63","limited knowledge","relevance","article","serotype","nidoviruses","toroviruses","antivirals","contrast"],"language":"en"},

A unique feature of alphabaculovirus infection of insect cells is the robust nuclear accumulation of Arp2/3, which induces actin polymerization in the nucleus to assist in virus replication. We found that Ac34, a viral late gene product encoded by the alphabaculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), is involved in Arp2/3 nuclear accumulation during virus infection. Further assays revealed that the subcellular distribution of Arp2/3 under steady-state conditions is controlled by chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent nuclear export.

We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4\u20143.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza.

Thus, we aimed to define the healthy microbiota and the viral pathogen-affected microbiota in the upper respiratory tract. In addition, any association between the type of viral agent and the resultant microbiota profile was assessed. METHODS: We analyzed the upper respiratory tract bacterial content of 57 healthy asymptomatic people (17 health-care workers and 40 community people) and 59 patients acutely infected with influenza, parainfluenza, rhino, respiratory syncytial, corona, adeno, or metapneumo viruses using culture-independent pyrosequencing. RESULTS: The healthy subjects harbored primarily Streptococcus, whereas the patients showed an enrichment of Haemophilus or Moraxella. Quantifying the similarities between bacterial populations by using Fast UniFrac analysis indicated that bacterial profiles were apparently divisible into 6 oropharyngeal types in the tested subjects. The oropharyngeal types were not associated with the type of viruses, but were rather linked to the age of the subjects. Moraxella nonliquefaciens exhibited unprecedentedly high abundance in young subjects aged \u003C6 years. The genome of M. nonliquefaciens was found to encode various proteins that may play roles in pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 6 oropharyngeal microbiome types. No virus-specific bacterial profile was discovered, but comparative analysis of healthy adults and patients identified a bacterium specific to young patients, M. nonliquefaciens.

Methods Viruses from cell culture materials or clinical specimens were identified following an improved NGS procedure: reduction of background noise by sample preprocessing, viral enrichment by barcoded oligonucleotide (random hexamer or non-ribosomal hexanucleotide) primer-based amplification, fragmentation-free library construction and sequencing of one-tube mixtures, as well as rapid data analysis using an in-house pipeline. Results NGS data demonstrated that both barcoded primer sets were useful to simultaneously capture multiple viral pathogens in cell culture materials or clinical specimens and verified that hexanucleotide primers captured as many viral sequences as hexamers did. Moreover, direct testing of clinical specimens using this improved hexanucleotide primer-based NGS approach provided further detailed genotypes of enteroviruses causing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and identified other potential viruses or differentiated misdiagnosis events. Conclusion The improved barcoded oligonucleotide primer-based NGS approach is simplified, time saving, cost effective, and appropriate for direct identification of viral pathogens in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"WANG, Chun Hua; NIE, Kai; ZHANG, Yi; WANG, Ji; ZHOU, Shuai Feng; LI, Xin Na; ZHOU, Hang Yu; QI, Shun Xiang; MA, Xue Jun","journal":"Biomedical and Environmental Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1a909345256caa04599d476a4436c5f00d55016.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2017.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398817300156; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398817300156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical samples","clinical practice","clinical use of common NGS","improved hexanucleotide primer-based NGS approach","direct testing of clinical specimens","improved NGS procedure","Results NGS data","improved barcoded oligonucleotide primer-based NGS approach","viral enrichment","multiple viral pathogens","direct identification of viral pathogens","viral sequences","accurate identification of viral pathogens","primer-based amplification","barcoded primer sets","high background noise","cell culture materials","tremendous data analysis","rapid data analysis","hexanucleotide primers","high cost","reduction of background noise","non-ribosomal hexanucleotide","generation sequencing","potential viruses","Methods Viruses","random hexamer","sample preprocessing","fragmentation-free library construction","foot","hand","detailed genotypes of enteroviruses","complicated procedures","enormous limitations","HFMD","mouth disease","differentiated misdiagnosis events","tube mixtures","in-house pipeline","time","Conclusion","Abstract Objective","hexamers"],"language":"en"},

In addition to integrative control of its aphid vector, it is of interest to examine diversity and evolution among different TBTV isolates. METHODS: 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 RACE, combined with one step full-length RT-PCR, were used to clone the full-length genome of three new isolates of TBTV that exhibited mild pathogenicity in Chinese fields. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the TBTV isolates were analyzed by DNAMAN. MEGA 5.0 was used to construct phylogenetic trees. RDP4 was used to detect recombination events during evolution of these isolates. RESULTS: The genomes of three isolates, termed TBTV-JC, TBTV-MD-I and TBTV-MD-II, were 4152 nt in length and included one distinctive difference from previously reported TBTV isolates: the first nucleotide of the genome was a guanylate instead of an adenylate. Diversity and phylogenetic analyses among these three new TBTV isolates and five other available isolates suggest that ORFs and 3\u2019UTRs of TBTV may have evolved separately. Moreover, the RdRp-coding region was the most variable. Recombination analysis detected a total of 29 recombination events in the 8 TBTV isolates, in which 24 events are highly likely and 5 events have low-level likelihood based on their correlation with the phylogenetic trees. The three new TBTV isolates have individual recombination patterns with subtle divergences in parents and locations. CONCLUSIONS: The genome sizes of TBTV isolates were constant while different ORF-coding regions and 3\u2019UTRs may have evolved separately. The RdRp-coding region was the most variable. Frequent recombination occurred among TBTV isolates. Three new TBTV isolates have individual recombination patterns and may have different progenitors.

Opinions on the suitability of patients with malignancies not undergoing active treatment and in different phases of antineoplastic therapy, to receive influenza vaccination, vary considerably among oncologists, sometimes even within one center. METHODS: We reviewed available data, including recommendations by national health authorities, on impact of influenza in patients with cancer and their capacity to mount protective immunological responses to vaccination, thus allowing, on behalf of Italian Association of Medical Oncology, to make suitable recommendations for the prevention and treatment of seasonal influenza. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Patients with cancer often have disease- or treatment-related immunosuppression, and as a consequence, they may have a suboptimal serologic response to influenza vaccination. The protective effect of the different preparations of influenza vaccines in patients with cancer has not been widely investigated, especially in adult patients harboring solid tumors. The optimal timing for administration of influenza vaccines in patients receiving chemotherapy is also not clearly defined. However, since vaccination is the most effective method, along with antiviral drugs in selected patients, for preventing influenza infection, it has to be recommended for cancer patients. Implementing vaccination of close contacts of oncology patients would be an additional tool for enhancing protection in fragile patient populations.","publish_time":"2014-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedrazzoli, P.; Baldanti, F.; Donatelli, I.; Castrucci, M.

Despite widespread outbreaks in many countries, no effective PDCoV vaccines are currently available. Here, we generated, for the first time, a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PDCoV. We further manipulated the infectious clone by replacing the NS6 gene with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to generate rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP; likewise, rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 was constructed by removing the ATG start codons of the NS7 gene. Growth kinetics studies suggest that rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 could replicate similarly to that of the wild-type PDCoV, whereas rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP exhibited a substantial reduction of viral titer in vitro and in vivo. Piglets inoculated with rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 or wild-type PDCoV showed similar diarrheic scores and pathological injury. In contrast, rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP-infected piglets did not show any clinical signs, indicating that the NS6 protein is an important virulence factor of PDCoV and that the NS6-deficient mutant virus might be a promising live-attenuated vaccine candidate.

The newly distributed Golgi membranes co-localize with viral RNA replication templates, strongly suggesting that the observed vesicles are the sites of viral RNA replication. Expression of the HRV-1A 3A protein induces alterations in the Golgi staining pattern similar to those seen during viral infection, and expressed 3A localizes to the Golgi-derived membranes. Taken together, these data show that in HRV-1A infection, the 3A protein plays a role in fragmenting the Golgi complex and generating vesicles that are used as the site of viral RNA replication.","publish_time":"2010-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quiner, Claire A.; Jackson, William T.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f35b94ba81db851c3c20ab2a4495f1ec4ab590b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111317.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.08.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210005295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825962/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210005295","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Golgi-derived membranes","HRV","viral RNA replication templates","sites of viral RNA replication","site of viral RNA replication","Golgi apparatus","Golgi complex","viral infection","distributed Golgi membranes co-","genomic RNA","novel organelle source of replication membranes","Golgi staining pattern similar","positive-stranded RNA genome","observed vesicles","protein","association","human rhinovirus","alterations","fragmentation","host cell","viruses","role","nm diameter","Expression","data"],"language":"en"},

The weekly diarrhoea cases crossed the threshold action line during week beginning 5(th) September at the children\u2019s clinic in Rimuka Township, and the remaining four clinics reported cases crossing threshold action lines between week beginning 12(th) September and week beginning 26(th) September. Eighty-two percent of the cases were children less than 5 years old. We conducted a case controlstudy to determine risk factorsfor contracting watery diarrhoea in children less than 5 years in Kadoma City. METHODS: An unmatched 1:1 case control study was conducted in Ngezi and Rimuka townships in Kadoma City, Zimbabwe. A case was a child less than 5 years old, who developed acute watery diarrhoea between 5(th) September and 1(st) October 2011. A control was a child less than 5 years old who stayed in the same township and did not suffer from diarrhoea. A structured questionnaire was administered to caregivers of cases and controls.Laboratory water quality tests and stool test results were reviewed.Epi Info\u2122 statistical software was used to analyse data. RESULTS: A total of 109 cases and 109 controls were enrolled. Independent protective factors were: having been exclusively breastfed for six months [AOR = 0.44; 95% CI (0.24-0.82)]; using municipal water [AOR = 0.38; 95% CI (0.18-0.80)]; using aqua tablets, [AOR = 0.49; 95% CI (0.26\u20130.94)] and; storing water in closed containers, [AOR = 0.24; 95% CI (0.07\u20130.0.83). The only independent risk factor for contracting watery diarrhoea was hand washing in a single bowl, [AOR = 2.89; 95% CI (1.33\u20136.28)]. Salmonella, Shigella, Rotavirus, and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated in the stool specimens. None of the 33 municipal water samples tested showed contamination with Escherichia coli, whilst 23 of 44 (52%) shallow well water samples and 3 of 15(20%) borehole water samples tested were positive for Escherichia coli. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak resulted from inadequate clean water and use of contaminated water. Evidence from this study was used to guide public health response to the outbreak.","publish_time":"2013-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maponga, Brian A; Chirundu, Daniel; Gombe, Notion T; Tshimanga, Mufuta; Shambira, Gerald; Takundwa, Lucia","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdaa41a645ce89eceb52fe4c3307fdac0c86e27d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4219403.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24295488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kadoma City","Zimbabwe"],"keyphrases":["AOR","weekly diarrhoea cases","contaminated water","municipal water samples","caregivers of cases","borehole water samples","acute watery diarrhoea","years old","inadequate clean water","Kadoma City","Laboratory water quality tests","Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli","case control study","outbreak","case controlstudy","threshold action lines","stool test results","independent risk factor","risk factorsfor","Rimuka townships","stool specimens","Independent protective factors","Ngezi","clinics","showed contamination","increase","Epi Info","hand washing","Rotavirus","single bowl","statistical software","Shigella","Zimbabwe","children\u2019s clinic","public health response","BACKGROUND","total","closed containers","structured questionnaire","data","Salmonella","CONCLUSIONS","aqua tablets","percent","METHODS","Evidence","months"],"language":"en"},

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23\u00B0C\u201325 \u00B0C than at 4 \u00B0C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"La Rosa, Giuseppina; Bonadonna, Lucia; Lucentini, Luca; Kenmoe, Sebastien; Suffredini, Elisabetta","journal":"Water Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b6b23d6d9785a64c65390921c4270973d1a4455.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187830.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313542030436X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361598/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004313542030436X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115899","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","CoV persistence","recovery of CoV","CoV occurrence","water environments","human transmission","human coronaviruses","human health","enveloped viruses","contaminated drinking-water","non-enveloped human enteric viruses","research data","known waterborne transmission","large family of viruses","ground waters","transmission need","methods","comprehensive research","Abstract Coronaviruses","COVID","scoping review","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","severe diseases","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","concentration of enteric","viral survival","spectrum of disease","recent outbreak of coronavirus disease","fecal samples","possibility of fecal","current evidence","virus responsible","data available","titer of infectious virus","evidence-based knowledge","public health emergency","EMBASE","temperature","risk analysis processes","main areas","paper","electronic databases PubMed","patients","wastewater chain","surface","sanitation safety planning","Web Science Core Collection","anal swabs","important factor","relevant studies","droplets","direct contact","sampling","exposure","oxidants","chlorine","low stability","literature survey","records","criteria"],"language":"en"},

As hospital systems run far over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing frontline care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system\u2019s full support is required to address the needs of its workforce. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force\u2014created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system\u2014used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the rollout of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ripp, Jonathan; Peccoralo, Lauren; Charney, Dennis","journal":"Acad Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd9fd0274291591f548c9c3798c0d7eba10b5068.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176260.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mount Sinai Health System","MSHS","Trainee Crisis Support Task Force"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emotional well-being of health care workers","behavioral health","health system\u2019s","MSHS COVID","mental health support options","emotional needs","strong well-being support model","frontline care","Trainee Crisis Support Task Force","well-being leaders","Mount Sinai Health System","work force","entire MSHS workforce","pandemic","MSHS Employee","rollout of support initiatives","rapid needs assessment model","basic daily needs","possible shortages of critical care medical resources","priority areas central","human resources","personal safety","central element","personal protective equipment","work group strategy","New York City","psychological stressors","communications","Faculty","clinician deaths","potential impact","capacity","reassuring messages","delivery of current","unacceptable risks","patients","implications","enormous strain","appropriate fears","authors","concerns","staff","setting of contagion","moral obligation","Invited Commentary","hospital systems","response"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there is neither a licensed vaccine nor effective treatment, characterizing an unmet clinical need. The IgY refers to the egg yolk immunoglobulin (Y=yolk) and its production and use are subjects of many studies due to the diversity of its diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Several researchers have shown that the use of specific IgY may prevent and/or control infectious and parasitic diseases. Based on these evidences, the aim of this study was to immunize chickens with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi in order to produce highly effective and pure antibodies (IgY), as well as extract, characterize, quantify, and verify cytotoxic effects of IgY anti-T. cruzi. After the induction of IgY production by chickens, the eggs were collected and the IgY was extracted by method of precipitation of polyethylene glycol 6000. The IgY anti-T. cruzi characterization was performed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western-blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, the cytotoxic or proliferative effects of IgY anti-T. cruzi was verified by MTT assay. The concentration of IgY in yolk was 8.41\u00B11.47mg/mL. The characterization of IgY reveled bands of stained peptides with molecular weight between 75 and 50kDa and 37 and 25kDa. In the ELISA test was observed that there was antigen-antibody reaction throughout the sample period. The concentrations of 1, 5 and 10mg/mL of IgY anti-T. cruzi presented no cytotoxic of proliferative effects in mononuclear and VERO cells in vitro. The results indicated that T. cruzi is able to generate a high production of specific immunoglobulins in chickens, it did not cause damage to the cell membrane and no proliferative effect.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grando, Thirssa H.; Baldissera, Matheus D.; de S\u00E1, Mari\u00E2ngela F.; do Carmo, Guilherme M.; Porto, Bianca Carolina Z.; Aguirre, Gisele S.V.; Azevedo, Maria Isabel; de Jesus, Francielli P.K.; Santurio, Janio M.; Sagrillo, Michele R.; Stefani, Lenita Moura; Monteiro, Silvia Gonzalez","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4469e939c333b6b38d126b2d54be344ad299cf28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126890.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2017.07.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002217591730279X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697990/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002217591730279X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Trypanosoma"],"organizations":["MTT","VERO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cruzi characterization","Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi","cytotoxic of proliferative effects","cytotoxic effects","chickens","use of specific","kDa","high production of specific immunoglobulins","egg yolk immunoglobulin","effective treatment","MTT assay","ELISA test","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","flagellated protozoan belonging","Trypanosomatidae family","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","SDS-PAGE","western-blot","reveled bands of stained peptides","molecular weight","etiologic agent of Chagas disease","diversity","antigen-antibody reaction","study","cell membrane","VERO cells","order","trypomastigotes","unmet clinical need","sample period","method of precipitation","polyethylene glycol","therapeutic applications","studies","licensed vaccine","damage","subjects","pure antibodies","parasitic diseases","evidences","aim","results","induction","eggs","researchers","extract","concentrations"],"language":"en"},

Two ORFs were found, encoding polypeptides of 11 K (ORF-1) and 22K (ORF-2). The FIPV sequence was compared to the 3\u2032 end sequence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). ORF-1 has a homologous counterpart (ORF-X3) in the TGEV genome; both ORFs are located at the same position relative to the nucleocapsid gene. However, as a result of an in-frame insertion or deletion, ORF-1 is 69 nucleotides larger than ORF-X3. A similar event has occurred immediately downstream of ORF1: a 624-nucleotide segment, containing the complete ORF-2, is absent in the TGEV sequence. Most sequence similarity (98.5%) was found in the 3\u2032 noncoding sequences. ORF-X3 and ORF-1 are preceded by the sequence AAC-TAAAC, which is assumed to be the transcription-initiation signal in FIPV and TGEV (P. A. Kapke and D. A. Brian (1986) Virology 151, 41\u201349). By S1 nuclease analysis, the 5\u2032 end of FIPV RNA 6 was mapped immediately upstream of this sequence. A 700-nucleotide TGEV-specific RNA was found by cross-hybridization with an FIPV 3\u2032 end probe, suggesting that TGEV ORF-X3 is also carried on a separate mRNA. The differences at the 3\u2032 ends of the FIPV and TGEV genomes maybe the result of RNA recombination events.","publish_time":"1988-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Groot, Raoul J.; Andeweg, Arno C.; Horzinek, Marian C.; Spaan, Willy J.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02569bcf9a7e53d2d262ef58dbfb2f9d38e7c7b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682288900979; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288900979","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["D.

As a result, 15\u201316kb nucleotide sequences encoding complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins plus other open reading frames (ORFs) were generated. Sequences analysis confirmed that the CoVs from Kenya bats are divergent members of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. Furthermore, the CoVs BtKY22, BtKY41, and BtKY43 in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY24 in Betacoronavirus genus are likely representatives of 4 novel CoV species. BtKY27 and BtKY33 are members of the established bat CoV species in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY06 is a member of the established bat CoV species in Betacoronavirus genus. The genome organization of these seven CoVs is similar to other known CoVs from the same groups except for differences in the number of putative ORFs following the N gene. The present results confirm a significant diversity of CoVs circulating in Kenya bats. These Kenya bat CoVs are phylogenetically distant from any previously described human and animal CoVs. However, because of the examples of host switching among CoVs after relatively minor sequence changes in S1 domain of spike protein, a further surveillance in animal reservoirs and understanding the interface between host susceptibility is critical for predicting and preventing the potential threat of bat CoVs to public health.","publish_time":"2012-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Ying; Tang, Kevin; Shi, Mang; Conrardy, Christina; Li, Kenneth S.M.; Lau, Susanna K.P.; Anderson, Larry J.; Tong, Suxiang","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c9baad54199eda3886db5183934bbc0094d91f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114443.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22561208/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170212001335; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170212001335","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["animal CoVs","Kenya bat CoVs","known CoVs","CoVs BtKY22","significant diversity of CoVs","potential threat of bat CoVs","Alphacoronavirus genus","Betacoronavirus genus","Kenya bats","established bat CoV species","novel CoV species","divergent members of Alphacoronavirus","partial polymerase gene sequences","nucleotide sequences","Betacoronavirus genera","Sequences analysis","complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase","likely representatives","genetic diversity","N gene","genomic features","host susceptibility","animal reservoirs","examples of host","different phylogenetic groups","number of putative ORFs","extensive genomic sequencing","S1 domain of spike protein","envelope","BtKY24","minor sequence changes","nucleocapsid proteins","BtKY43","BtKY06","open reading frames","interface","membrane","differences","BtKY41","coronaviruses","public health","surveillance","BtKY33","present results","genome organization","BtKY27"],"language":"en"},

The clinical trials are underway for Remdesivir, an investigational anti-viral drug from Gilead Sciences. Antimalarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives are being used in emergency cases; however, they are not suitable for patients with conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cardiac issues. The lack of availability of approved treatment for this disease calls forth the scientific community to find novel compounds with the ability to treat it. This paper evaluates the compound Andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata as a potential inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-COV-2 (Mpro) through in silico studies such as molecular docking, target analysis, toxicity prediction and ADME prediction. Andrographolide was docked successfully in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Computational approaches also predicts this molecule to have good solubility, pharmacodynamics property and target accuracy.

In this context, it is important to shed light on the gaps in the epidemiological characteristics and the geographic range for many AFI aetiologies. OBJECTIVES: To review studies on community-acquired fever aetiology other than malaria in Latin America, and to highlight knowledge gaps and challenges needing further investigation. SOURCES: PubMed from 2012 to April 2018. CONTENT: We found 17 eligible studies describing 13 539 patients. The median number of pathogens tested per individual was 3.5 (range 2\u201317). A causative pathogen could be determined for 6661 (49.2%) individuals. The most frequently reported pathogen during the study periods was dengue virus (DENV) (14 studies), followed by chikungunya virus (nine studies) and Zika virus (seven studies). Among the studies reporting concurrent infections, 296 individuals (2.2%) were found to have co-infections. In-hospital mortality was reported in eight (47%) studies, ranging between 0% and 18%. IMPLICATIONS: DENV fever is the febrile illness most frequently reported, reflecting its importance, while chikungunya and zika viruses present increasing trends since their emergence in the region. Studies with systematic and harmonized approaches for detection of multiple pathogens are needed and would probably reveal a higher burden of neglected pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. and arenaviruses. The lack of point-of-care tests and harmonized approach limits the care provided by health professionals and the efficacy of surveillance for AFI in the region.","publish_time":"2018-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreira, J.; Bressan, C.S.; Brasil, P.; Siqueira, A.M.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa6f5130d1109243bee530c972d97bb6653fd7e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172187.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.05.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X18304014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X18304014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AFI"],"locations":["Latin America"],"keyphrases":["eligible studies","region","new pathogens","DENV fever","chikungunya virus","reported pathogen","malaria decreases","Latin America","fever aetiology","detection of multiple pathogens","proportion of fever","dengue virus","AFI aetiologies","median number of pathogens","individuals","higher burden of neglected pathogens","malaria control measures","harmonized approaches","care tests","causes of acute febrile illness","knowledge gaps","geographic range","concurrent infections","causative pathogen","co-infections","zika viruses present increasing trends","study periods","emergence","complexity","health professionals","epidemiological characteristics","efficacy of surveillance","Rickettsia","community","light","challenges","investigation","BACKGROUND","importance","IMPLICATIONS","lack of point","arenaviruses","CONTENT","patients","OBJECTIVES","SOURCES","PubMed","hospital mortality","context"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prebiotic supplementation with stabilized rice bran (SRB) in milk on health, immunity, and performance of pre-weaned organic dairy calves. Holstein heifer calves (n = 90) were enrolled at 6 \u00B1 1 days old and monitored for 28 days, from July to August 2017. Calves were randomly assigned to a control (CTR; n = 45) or a treatment group (SRB; n = 45). The CTR group received milk alone and the SRB group received 120 g of SRB per day in milk to achieve a 10% w/w dose of the total calories. Daily health evaluations were conducted to score health status and disease severity (healthy, slightly affected, moderately or severely sick) of calves, through integrated assessment of diarrhea, dehydration, attitude, and milk intake. Body weights and fecal IgA quantification were completed on the first and last day of the study. RESULTS: Overall, weight gain and fecal IgA concentrations were not affected by the dietary addition of SRB. The total number of calf-days classified as healthy or sick were not different between treatment groups. Similarly, the number of calf-days categorized as slightly affected, moderately sick, or severely sick did not differ between treatment groups. Time to event analyses indicated a tendency for a treatment effect in the time to the first moderate case of diarrhea (P = 0.08), as well as in the time to recovery from diarrhea (P = 0.052), favoring control calves. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the dietary addition of SRB in milk did not have an effect in health, immunity or performance of pre-weaned dairy calves.","publish_time":"2019-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Velasquez-Munoz, Ana; Manriquez, Diego; Paudyal, Sushil; Han, Hyungchul; Callan, Robert; Ryan, Elizabeth P.; Pinedo, Pablo","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/273ed1bf60b19e3db4ab3894a20598336b7e0ef4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6367819.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1802-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":["CTR","SRB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SRB group","control calves","g of SRB","treatment effect","dietary addition of SRB","performance of pre-weaned dairy calves","milk intake","Holstein heifer calves","Time","treatment groups","performance of pre-weaned organic dairy calves","health status","CTR group","days old","immunity","Daily health evaluations","total number of calf","RESULTS","study","effect of prebiotic supplementation","fecal IgA concentrations","integrated assessment of diarrhea","fecal IgA quantification","moderate case of diarrhea","w dose","total calories","stabilized rice bran","dehydration","high susceptibility","significant challenges","month of life","weight gain","attitude","tendency","Body weights","disease severity","digestive diseases","event analyses","recovery","BACKGROUND","objective","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, the anticancer mechanism of silver nanoparticles is unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of AgNPs on proliferation and activation of ROS-mediated signaling pathway on human hepatocellular carcinoma HePG-2 cells. A simple chemical method for preparing AgNPs with superior anticancer activity has been showed in this study. AgNPs were detected by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The size distribution and zeta potential of silver nanoparticles were detected by Zetasizer Nano. The average size of AgNPs (2 nm) observably increased the cellular uptake by endocytosis. AgNPs markedly inhibited the proliferation of HePG-2 cells through induction of apoptosis with caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. AgNPs with dose-dependent manner significantly increased the apoptotic cell population (sub-G1). Furthermore, AgNP-induced apoptosis was found dependent on the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and affecting of MAPKs and AKT signaling and DNA damage-mediated p53 phosphorylation to advance HePG-2 cells apoptosis. Therefore, our results show that the mechanism of ROS-mediated signaling pathways may provide useful information in AgNP-induced HePG-2 cell apoptosis.","publish_time":"2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Bing; Li, Yinghua; Lin, Zhengfang; Zhao, Mingqi; Xu, Tiantian; Wang, Changbing; Deng, Ning","journal":"Nanoscale Res Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57b8e034f902f2883dbbafaeef554cb2deb64963.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4830774.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-016-1419-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27075340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Zetasizer Nano"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of AgNPs","cells apoptosis","average size of AgNPs","proliferation of HePG","cell apoptosis","AgNP-induced HePG","AgNP-induced apoptosis","activation of ROS","mechanism of ROS","anticancer mechanism of silver nanoparticles","induction of apoptosis","zeta potential of silver nanoparticles","study","human hepatocellular carcinoma HePG","size distribution","DNA damage-mediated p53 phosphorylation","apoptotic cell population","dose-dependent manner","superior anticancer activity","TEM","caspase","energy dispersive X-ray","transmission electronic microscopy","overproduction of reactive oxygen species","nm","pathways","useful information","overcome tumors","sub-G1","AKT","MAPKs","simple chemical method","cellular uptake","novel approach","EDX","PARP cleavage","Zetasizer Nano","endocytosis","hepatocarcinoma","results","purpose"],"language":"en"},

The viral envelope (E) protein, the principal surface protein of viral particles, plays a vital role in viral entry and fusion. In this study, two peptides derived from domain II (DII) and the stem of the TMUV envelope protein, TP1 and TP2, respectively, were tested for their antiviral activity. TP1 and TP2 inhibited TMUV infection in BHK-21 cells, and their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 14.19 mg/L and 7.64 mg/L, respectively. Viral inhibition assays in different cell lines of avian origin showed that the inhibitory effects of TP1 and TP2 are not cell type dependent. Moreover, TP2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. The two peptides inhibited antibody-mediated TMUV infection of duck peripheral blood lymphocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation assays and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) indicated that both peptides interact with the surface of the TMUV virion. RNase digestion assays confirmed the release of viral RNA following incubation with TP1, while incubation with TP1 or TP2 interfered with the binding between TMUV and cells. Taken together, these results show that TP1 and TP2 may be developed into antiviral treatments against TMUV infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Dongmin; Zhang, Lijiao; Han, Kaikai; Liu, Qingtao; Yang, Jing; Huang, Xinmei; Liu, Yuzhuo; Li, Yin; Zhao, Peng","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfcbf976574f0084a1f4c4d72a769c94c912c23a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204726.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113520301991; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113520301991?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMUV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TP2 inhibited TMUV infection","TMUV envelope protein","TMUV virion","viral envelope","Viral inhibition assays","inhibitory effects of TP1","viral entry","peptides","inhibitory activity","principal surface protein of viral particles","release of viral RNA","antibody-mediated TMUV infection of duck peripheral blood lymphocytes","Co-immunoprecipitation assays","RNase digestion assays","incubation","inhibitory concentrations","antiviral activity","cells","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","Tembusu virus","antiviral treatments","Japanese encephalitis virus","different cell lines of avian origin","vital role","ELISAs","JEV","BHK","large losses","fusion","stem","waterfowl-breeding industry","binding","domain","DII","type dependent","outbreak","study","IC50","results"],"language":"en"},

In addition to direct antiviral activities, type I IFN serves as an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response through multiple mechanisms. Therefore, the outcome of a viral infection can be affected by IFN induction and the IFN sensitivity of a virus. North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) field isolates were studied with regard to IFN-\u03B1 sensitivity and induction in order to understand the role of type I IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis. PRRSV isolates were differentially sensitive to porcine recombinant IFN-\u03B1 (rIFN-\u03B1) and varied in their ability to induce IFN-\u03B1 in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) cultures as measured by a porcine IFN-\u03B1 specific ELISA on cell culture supernatants. Fifty-two plaques were purified from three PRRSV isolates (numbers 3, 7, and 12) and tested for IFN sensitivity and IFN induction. Plaque-derived populations were composed of heterogeneous populations in terms of IFN-inducing capacity and sensitivity to rIFN-\u03B1. When macrophages infected with isolates 3, 7, or 12 were treated with polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), IFN-\u03B1 production was enhanced. Cells infected with isolate 3 and treated with polyI:C showed the most consistent and strongest enhancement of IFN-\u03B1 production. It was demonstrated that the relatively low concentrations of IFN-\u03B1 produced by isolate 3 contributed to the enhanced IFN-\u03B1 synthesis in response to polyI:C. Isolates 7 and 12 significantly suppressed the enhanced IFN-\u03B1 production by isolate 3 in polyI:C treated cells. To determine if suppression was at the level of IFN-\u03B1 transcription, quantitative RT-PCR was performed for IFN-\u03B1 mRNA and compared to GAPDH and cyclophilin mRNA quantification. However, the relative number of IFN-\u03B1 transcript copies did not correlate with IFN-\u03B1 protein levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of suppression. In summary, these results demonstrate that PRRSV field isolates differ both in IFN-\u03B1 sensitivity and induction. Furthermore, a PRRSV field isolate strongly enhance polyI:C-induced IFN-\u03B1 production in PAM cultures and this priming effect was suppressed by other PRRSV isolates.","publish_time":"2004-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sang-Myeong; Schommer, Susan K.; Kleiboeker, Steven B.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f80b60227c85120ccb3f1de3374c2c03b16f022.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112598.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704002557; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704002557","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1 sensitivity","IFN-\u03B1 mRNA","IFN sensitivity","IFN induction","terms of IFN","level of IFN","enhanced IFN-\u03B1 production","porcine recombinant IFN-\u03B1","enhanced IFN-\u03B1 synthesis","IFN-\u03B1 protein levels","C-induced IFN-\u03B1 production","rIFN-\u03B1","\u03B1 transcription","porcine IFN-\u03B1 specific ELISA","strongest enhancement of IFN","relative number of IFN","low concentrations of IFN","PRRSV isolates","\u03B1 transcript copies","PRRSV field isolates","polyI","PRRSV pathogenesis","C treated cells","role of type","porcine alveolar macrophages","PAM cultures","viral infection","important role","Abstract Type","heterogeneous populations","important link","antiviral responses","respiratory syndrome virus","innate host defense","adaptive immune response","direct antiviral activities","Plaque-derived populations","cyclophilin mRNA quantification","post-transcriptional mechanism of suppression","quantitative RT-PCR","cell culture supernatants","GAPDH","priming effect","capacity","order","regard","multiple mechanisms","results","interferons","addition","polycytidylic acid","ability","outcome","summary","plaques","numbers"],"language":"en"},

This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a needs-based education programme provided within the first 3 days of patients\u2019 hospitalisation, on the anxiety levels and satisfaction of psychosocial needs of their families. This was a quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-test design. A convenience sample was recruited over a period of three months, consisting of one primary family carer of each critically ill patient who had been admitted to an ICU in Hong Kong. Conducted by an ICU nurse specially assigned for the purpose, family carers in the experimental group ( n = 34 ) received an individual education programme based on the results of a literature review and an individual family needs assessment carried out at the time of patient admission, using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. The subjects in the control group ( n = 32 ) received the usual orientation and explanation given by the ICU nurses. Anxiety and need satisfaction were measured in the two groups at pre- and post-test and their mean scores were compared. Of the ten most important statements identified by the family carers in the two groups, the statements regarding the needs for information and assurance were found to predominate. After the needs-based intervention, the experimental group reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of satisfaction of family needs than the control group at the post-test. The findings support the effectiveness of providing families of newly admitted critically ill patients, with a needs-based educational intervention to allay anxiety and satisfy immediate psychosocial needs. The formulation of a family education programme should be based on the results of a needs assessment, in order to meet family carers\u2019 individual needs.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chien, Wai-Tong; Chiu, Y.

We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients. Methods We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. Findings Patients\u0027 age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus. Interpretation A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.","publish_time":"2003-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peiris, JSM; Lai, ST; Poon, LLM; Guan, Y; Yam, LYC; Lim, W; Nicholls, J; Yee, WKS; Yan, WW; Cheung, MT; Cheng, VCC; Chan, KH; Tsang, DNC; Yung, RWH; Ng, TK; Yuen, KY","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b29e04e00ce19967406aed95d2369fff1b647489.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112372.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603130772; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603130772","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS","severe disease","laboratory findings","microbiological findings","auscultatory findings","disease progression","Findings Patients\u0027 age","microbiological investigation","clinical presentation","definitive laboratory diagnosis","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","respiratory symptoms","chest radiography","laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates","older age","use of serological","chest radiographic changes","molecular tests specific","reverse-transcriptase PCR specific","causal agents","infected people","liver dysfunction","lymphopenia","risk factors","sera samples","Summary Background","case notes","cough","household contacts","controls","diseases","viral cause","chills","myalgia","linked transmission clusters","Methods","evidence of infection","cofactors","primary agent","coronavirus","family Coronaviridae","frequent complaints","Fever","Interpretation","identity","Hong Kong","years"],"language":"en"},

However, the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to know whether the pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of respiratory virus. METHODS: Study subjects were 5,298 patients, who underwent multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses, among who visited the emergency department or outpatient clinic with respiratory symptoms at Ulsan University Hospital between April 2013 and March 2016. The patients\u0027 medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 251 clinically significant bacteria were identified in 233 patients with post-viral bacterial pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterium in patients aged \u003C16 years, regardless of the preceding virus type (p=0.630). In patients aged \u226516 years, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type. The major results were as follows (p\u003C0.001): pneumonia in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections was caused by similar bacteria, and the findings indicated that Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was very common in these patients. In contrast, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections were associated with pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of preceding respiratory virus. This information could help in selecting empirical antibiotics in patients with post-viral pneumonia.","publish_time":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Hwa Sik; Kang, Byung Ju; Ra, Seung Won; Seo, Kwang Won; Jegal, Yangjin; Jun, Jae-Bum; Jung, Jiwon; Jeong, Joseph; Jeon, Hee-Jeong; Ahn, Jae-Sung; Lee, Taehoon; Ahn, Jong Joon","journal":"Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60522266645f5d89d709c2a6dc0f45a072f64dfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5617852.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4046/trd.2017.0044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28905531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ulsan University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["post-viral pneumonia","type of respiratory virus","post-viral bacterial pneumonia","type of preceding respiratory virus","respiratory viral infections","pneumonia secondary","preceding virus type","respiratory syncytial virus infections","respiratory symptoms","parainfluenza virus","Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia","simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses","similar bacteria","significant bacteria","isolated bacteria","gram-negative bacteria","predominant bacterial species","pathogens","years","human metapneumovirus infections","Study subjects","major results","multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction","outpatient clinic","empirical antibiotics","Ulsan University Hospital","emergency department","rhinovirus","findings","frequent bacterium","coronavirus","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","contrast","total","METHODS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","patients\u0027 medical records","information","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Expression of DC-SIGNR resulted in robust JEV proliferation in a lymphoid cell line, Daudi cells, which was otherwise non-permissive to infection. DC-SIGN expression caused moderate JEV proliferation, with effects that varied according to the cells in which JEV was prepared. LSECtin expression had comparatively minor, but consistent, effects, in all cell types used in JEV preparation. While DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR-mediated JEV infection was inhibited by yeast mannan, LSECtin-mediated infection was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine \u03B21-2 mannose.

The filtration efficiency of selected NIOSH-approved particulate N95 and P100 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and filter cartridges was investigated against the viable MS2 virus, a non-pathogenic bacteriophage, aerosolized from a liquid suspension. Tests were performed under two cyclic flow conditions (minute volumes of 85 and 135 L/min) and two constant flow rates (85 and 270 L/min). The mean penetrations of viable MS2 through the N95 and P100 FFRs/cartridges were typically less than 2 and 0.03%, respectively, under all flow conditions.

The detailed clinical features of cases with SFTSV infection have not been well described, and the risk factors for severity among patients and fatality among severe patients remain to be determined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Clinical and laboratory features of 115 hospitalized patients with SFTSV infection during the period from June 2010 to December 2011 in Northeast China were retrospectively reviewed. We assessed the risk factors associated with severity in confirmed cases and fatality in severe cases by multivariate analysis. One hundred and three (89.6%) of 115 patients presented with multiple organ dysfunction, and 22 (19.1%) of 115 proceeded to the stage of life threatening multiple organ failure. Of the 115 patients, 14 fatalities (12.2%) were reported. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the independent predictors of risk for severity were: albumin \u226430 g/l (OR, 8.09; 95% CI, 2.58-25.32), APTT \u2265 66 seconds (OR, 14.28; 95% CI, 3.28-62.24), sodium \u2264130 mmol/l (OR, 5.44; 95% CI, 1.38-21.40), and presence of neurological manifestations (OR, 7.70; 95% CI, 1.91-31.12). Among patients with severe disease, presence of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1.48\u201314.19) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.38\u201313.03) were independently associated with fatality. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SFTSV infection may present with more severe symptoms and laboratory abnormalities than hitherto reported. Due to infection with a novel bunyavirus, the patients may sufferer multiple organ dysfunction and die of multiple organ failure. In the clinical assessment of any case of SFTS, independent factors relating to prognosis need to be taken into account by clinicians.","publish_time":"2013-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Baocheng; Zhou, Bo; Zhang, Shujun; Zhu, Ying; Han, Leqiang; Geng, Yingzhi; Jin, Zhenan; Liu, Hongbo; Wang, Donglei; Zhao, Yitong; Wen, Ying; Cui, Wei; Zhou, Ying; Gu, Qiuhong; Sun, Cuiming; Lu, Xu; Wang, Wen; Wang, Yu; Li, Chengbo; Wang, Yanli; Yao, Wenqing; Liu, Pei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00fcc6277c19f6b180232d7a6fe0b0abfafb21f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3827460.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24236203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFTS"],"locations":["China","Northeast China"],"keyphrases":["severe patients","severe cases","SFTSV infection","hospitalized patients","severe fever","severe disease","severity","severe symptoms","fatality","risk factors","sufferer multiple organ dysfunction","independent factors","detailed clinical features of cases","stage of life threatening multiple organ failure","confirmed cases","laboratory features","clinical assessment","independent predictors of risk","multivariate analysis","presence of acute lung injury","acute respiratory distress syndrome","novel bunyavirus","laboratory abnormalities","novel member","Northeast China","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","presence of neurological manifestations","genus phlebovirus","case of SFTS","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Bunyaviridae family","prognosis","METHODOLOGY","albumin","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","period","account","intravascular coagulation","BACKGROUND","APTT","seconds","sodium","mmol","clinicians","fatalities"],"language":"en"},

While its primary substrate appears to be Ang II, it can hydrolyze a number of other physiological substrates. Additionally, ACE2 functions in other noncatalytic cellular roles including the regulation of intestinal neutral amino acid transport. It also serendipitously acts as the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. Upregulation of ACE2 expression and function is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy in hypertension and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung injury, and fibrotic disorders.

We used archived satellite imagery collected from January 2010 to May 2013 and data on the incidence of respiratory virus illnesses from the Pan American Health Organization as a reference. We developed dynamical Elastic Net multivariable linear regression models to estimate the incidence of respiratory virus illnesses using hospital traffic and assessed how to minimize the effects of noise on the models. We noted that predictions based on models fitted using a sample of observations were better. The results were consistent across countries with selected models having reasonably low normalized root-mean-squared errors and high correlations for both the fits and predictions.

The precise mechanisms of ICP0-mediated transactivation are under intensive study. Here, we demonstrate that ICP0 can strongly activate AP-1 responsive genes specifically. This activation is inhibited by c-Jun (S73A), c-Jun (S63/73A), TAK1 (K63W), but not by p38 (AF), ERK1 (K71R), ERK2 (K52R) and TRAF6 (C85A/H87A). We further investigate the relevancy of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways using their respective inhibitors PD98059, SP600125 and SB202190. Only SP600125 significantly attenuates the AP-1 responsive gene activation by ICP0. Consistent with these, the JNK is remarkably activated in response to ICP0, and this JNK activation is shown to be significantly attenuated by TAK1 (K63W). It turns out that ICP0 interacts specifically with TAK1 and stimulates its kinase activity. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism ICP0 explores to regulate gene expression.","publish_time":"2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diao, Lirong; Zhang, Bianhong; Xuan, Chenghao; Sun, Shaogang; Yang, Kai; Tang, Yujie; Qiao, Wentao; Chen, Qimin; Geng, Yunqi; Wang, Chen","journal":"Experimental Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c12d9a39eab39c4c7e532d323929f754821d281.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094335.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014482705001928; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482705001928","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["precise mechanisms of ICP0","JNK activation","TAK1","immediate early protein ICP0","new molecular mechanism ICP0","responsive gene activation","SP600125","K63W","gene expression","responsive genes","p38 MAPK pathways","respective inhibitors PD98059","mediated transactivation","herpes simplex virus","TRAF6","K52R","K71R","ERK2","ERK1","SB202190","findings","relevancy of ERK","intensive study","C85A","HSV","response","transcription","productive infection","H87A","kinase activity","S73A","S63"],"language":"en"},

In humans and mice, IFITM3 limits influenza-induced morbidity and mortality. Although many IFITM3-sensitive viruses are zoonotic, whether IFITMs function as antiviral restriction factors in mammalian species other than humans and mice is unknown. Here, IFITM3 orthologues in the microbat (Myotis myotis) and pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) were identified using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Amino acid residues known to be important for IFITM3 function were conserved in the pig and microbat orthologues. Ectopically expressed pig and microbat IFITM3 co-localized with transferrin (early endosomes) and CD63 (late endosomes/multivesicular bodies). Pig and microbat IFITM3 restricted cell entry mediated by multiple influenza haemagglutinin subtypes and lyssavirus glycoproteins. Expression of pig or microbat IFITM3 in A549 cells reduced influenza virus yields and nucleoprotein expression. Conversely, small interfering RNA knockdown of IFITM3 in pig NPTr cells and primary microbat cells enhanced virus replication, demonstrating that these genes are functional in their species of origin at endogenous levels. In summary, we showed that IFITMs function as potent broad-spectrum antiviral effectors in two mammals \u2013 pigs and bats \u2013 identified as major reservoirs for emerging viruses.","publish_time":"2015-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benfield, Camilla T.

Moreover, they are accessible to a wide variety of surface-specific analytical techniques. This makes it possible to investigate processes such as cell signaling, ligand\u2013receptor interactions, enzymatic reactions occurring at the cell surface, as well as pathogen attack. In this review, the following membrane systems are discussed: black lipid membranes, solid supported lipid bilayers, hybrid lipid bilayers, and polymer cushioned lipid bilayers. Examples of how supported lipid membrane technology is interfaced with array based systems by photolithographic patterning, spatial addressing, microcontact printing, and microfluidic patterning are explored. Also, the use of supported lipid bilayers in microfluidic devices for the development of lab-on-a-chip based platforms is examined.

Other factors such as stress, poor husbandry and nutrition can also contribute to an animal\u0027s susceptibility to disease. Molecular biomarkers of production disease could be of immense value by improving diagnosis and risk analysis to determine best practice with an impact on increased economic output and animal welfare. In addition to the use of multiplex PCR or microarrays to detect individual or mixed pathogens during infection, these technologies can also be used to monitor the host response to infection via gene expression. The patterns of gene expression associated with cellular damage or initiation of the early immune response may indicate the type of pathology and, by extension the types of pathogen involved. Molecular methods can therefore be used to monitor both the presence of a pathogen and the host response to it during production disease. The field of biomarker discovery and implementation is expanding as technologies such as microarrays and next generation sequencing become more common. Whilst a large number of studies have been carried out in human medicine, further work is needed to identify molecular biomarkers in veterinary medicine and in particular those associated with production disease in the pig industry. The pig transcriptome is highly complex and still not fully understood. Further gene expression studies are needed to identify molecular biomarkers which may have predictive value in identifying the environmental, nutritional and other risk factors which are associated with production diseases in pigs.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giles, Timothy A.; Belkhiri, Aouatif; Barrow, Paul A.; Foster, Neil","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24577d7579a5a8c47ae285f40d5783fe5ce3885c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118804.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528816306956; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.05.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528816306956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28535467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Molecular biomarkers of production disease","Abstract Production disease","production diseases","gene expression studies","host response","Molecular methods","patterns of gene expression","microarrays","risk factors","infection","technologies","pigs","early immune response","immense value","risk analysis","predictive value","mixed pathogens","veterinary medicine","human medicine","types of pathogen","pig industry","pig transcriptome","increased economic output","variety of different pathogens","significant economic loss","large number of studies","impact","best practice","cellular damage","initiation","diagnosis","use of multiplex PCR","animal welfare","type of pathology","nutrition","implementation","extension","stress","poor husbandry","work","generation sequencing","field of biomarker discovery","addition","animal\u0027s susceptibility","presence"],"language":"en"},

They are classified by their number of sugar units: monosaccharides (such as glucose and fructose), and disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose) are simple carbohydrates; oligosaccharides and polysaccharides (such as starch, glycogen and cellulose) are complex carbohydrates. Carbohydrates play a crucial role in diverse biological systems [Hricov\u00EDn M. Structural aspects of carbohydrates and the relation with their biological properties. Curr Med Chem 2004;11:2565\u201383]. According to Roseman [Sugars of the cell membrane. In: Weissmann G, Clairborn E, editors. Cell membranes. Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Pathology. New York: H. P. Publ. Co; 1975. p. 55\u201364], two classes of glycoproteins are described. Free glycoproteins are localised in the surface coat of the membranes and form a thick mobile layer, without any association to the membrane itself. Functionally, however, they are located in a close association with the membrane (e.g. in the duodenal mucosa). The other group consists of the membrane glycoproteins, which are integral to the membranes and are located in the outer layer. The oligosaccharide chains are bound to the N-terminal part of proteins, and are situated in the hydrophilic zone. Glycoproteins have diverse functions. They are important in specific receptor functions, in immunological cell destruction and play a significant role in reactions with lectins, antibodies, as well as in cell association and mutual recognition of the cells. This paper focuses on aspects of a summary of polarisation optical investigations and biological functions of the following three groups of carbohydrates: oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makovitzky, Josef; Richter, Susann","journal":"Acta Histochemica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30e06118bafd9a9ba20dc0eb2133669dd2b51177.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172417.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065128108001402; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065128108001402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19157525/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acthis.2008.11.027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["H.

However, ZZ2004, a Chinese isolate of IBV, was obtained from ducks with clinical growth suppression and mild respiratory symptoms that had been reared with chickens in the central region of China. Virus isolation, virus neutralization testing, and RT-PCR were employed to identify the causative pathogen, while sequence alignment was used to analyze gene variations of the S1 subunit and M genes. The results showed that the ducks were infected with IBV due to the emergence of a dwarfing phenotype and the death of embryos between 48 and 144 h post-inoculation. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the results of the virus neutralization test indicated that the strains of JX/99/01, GD, SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with the ZZ2004 isolate, and hardly any cross-neutralization of IBV ZZ2004 was observed with the strains of M41, H120, Gray, Holte, or Aust-T. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there were large differences between ZZ2004 and other IBV reference strains on the S1 subunit. Meanwhile, homologies in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the M gene of IBV ZZ2004 were 86.9\u201392.0 % and 91.1\u201393.9 %, respectively, compared with 35 other IBV reference strains derived from different regions.

Furthermore, the results showed that the prevalent strains of IBV in ducks had no antigen homology with the vaccine strains widely used in China except the LDT3-strain, making it urgent to explore and develop new IBV vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Sixin; Ou, Changbo; Liu, Xingyou; Wang, Xianwen; Yao, Zonghui; Liu, Jinjing","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f699bf20cb6db946df99f8c4d544cb2d4dabfc5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089278.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1352-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["IBV reference strains","prevalent strains of IBV","gene of IBV ZZ2004","strains of M41","strains of JX","vaccine strains","selected strains","Chinese isolate of IBV","new IBV vaccines","ZZ2004 isolate","S1 subunit","ducks","RT-PCR","results","virus neutralization testing","cross-neutralization","Virus isolation","gene variations","infectious bronchitis virus","chickens","genes","egg production","cross-reactivity","respiratory distress","conspicuous variations","LDT3-strain","poor egg quality","mild respiratory symptoms","central region of China","clinical growth suppression","decrease","Holte","amino acid sequences","SAIBK","Gray","presence","expected fragment sizes","GD","large differences","antigen homology","sequence alignment","death of embryos","dwarfing phenotype","Aust","nucleotide","Phylogenetic analysis","occasional nephritis","H120","different regions","causative pathogen","homologies","emergence","h post-inoculation"],"language":"en"},

During a pandemic, the initial cases may be difficult to recognize, but subsequent clinical diagnoses were relatively straightforward, given the high volume of cases and their typical clinical presentation. Swine influenza pneumonia presents as an influenza-like illness (ILI) with dry cough, fever \u003E102\u00B0F and myalgias. A variety of other viral pneumonias, eg, cytomegalovirus, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV 3), and adenovirus, as well as bacterial community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) that may present with some of the clinical and laboratory features of H1N1 pneumonia. Most adults admitted to hospitals with ILIs during the pandemic had, in fact, definite or probable H1N1 pneumonia. The Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital developed a diagnostic weighted point score to identify probable H1N1 cases in hospitalized adults with rapid negative influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs). Methods We present a case of an elderly male who presented with an ILI and negative RIDTs during the H1N1 pandemic. He was admitted with a diagnosis of possible H1N1, and placed on influenza precautions and oseltamivir. Although the patient had features consistent with H1N1 pneumonia, Legionnaires\u0027 disease was included in the differential diagnosis because of his elevated serum ferritin levels. A Legionella urinary antigen test was positive for Legionella pneumophila (serogroups 01-06). Results The peak seasonal incidence of sporadic Legionnaires\u0027 disease occurs in the summer and fall. Even in the midst of a pandemic, clinicians should be on the alert for other infectious diseases that may mimic H1N1 pneumonia. In our experience, the best way to differentiate H1N1 from ILIs or other bacterial CAPs is through the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic weighted point score system for H1N1 pneumonia or its rapid simplified version, ie, the diagnostic swine influenza triad. Legionnaires\u0027 disease is the atypical CAP pathogen most likely to mimic H1N1 pneumonia. Conclusions Based on this and other nine cases at our institution during the \u201Cherald wave\u201D of pandemic, we conclude that Legionnaires\u0027 disease may mimic swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, Burke A.; Klein, Natalie C.; Strollo, Stephanie; Syed, Uzma; Mickail, Nardeen; Laguerre, Marianne","journal":"Heart \u0026 Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2092d5c00bfe7e1697a510d243dc63016863d5fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20457347/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956309002611; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956309002611; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.10.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background New York","Infectious Disease Division"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 pandemic","probable H1N1 pneumonia","Swine influenza pneumonia","probable H1N1 cases","laboratory features of H1N1 pneumonia","diagnosis of possible H1N1","diagnostic swine influenza triad","influenza precautions","rapid negative influenza diagnostic tests","Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic weighted point score system","initial cases","peak seasonal incidence of sporadic Legionnaires\u0027 disease","infectious diseases","negative RIDTs","high volume of cases","bacterial CAPs","ILIs","summer","typical clinical presentation","subsequent clinical diagnoses","hospitalized adults","Legionella pneumophila","differential diagnosis","bacterial community","viral pneumonias","rapid simplified version","Legionella urinary antigen test","Background New York area hospitals","atypical CAP pathogen","cytomegalovirus","fever","elevated serum ferritin levels","fact","dry cough","human parainfluenza virus","HPIV","illness","best way","spring","elderly male","adenovirus","serogroups","alert","institution","clinicians","herald wave","patient","myalgias","experience","variety","midst","oseltamivir","fall","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The clinical success of proteasome inhibitors in treating multiple myeloma has further stimulated enthusiasm for targeting UPS proteins for pharmacological intervention in cancer treatment, particularly in the precision medicine era. Unfortunately, despite tremendous efforts, the paucity of potent and selective UPS inhibitors has severely hampered attempts to exploit the UPS for therapeutic benefits. To tackle this problem, many groups have been working on technology advancement to rapidly and effectively screen for potent and specific UPS modulators as intracellular probes or early-phase therapeutic agents.

We performed this study to identify the risk factors of AKI associated with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Data from 322 adult patients receiving ECMO were analyzed. AKI and its stages were defined according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Variables within 24 h before ECMO insertion were collected and analyzed for the associations with AKI and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Stage 3 AKI was associated with in-hospital mortality, with a hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) of 2.690 (1.472\u20134.915) compared to non-AKI (p = 0.001). The simplified acute physiology score 2 (SAPS2) and serum sodium level were also associated with in-hospital mortality, with HRs of 1.02 (1.004\u20131.035) per 1 score increase (p = 0.01) and 1.042 (1.014\u20131.070) per 1 mmol/L increase (p = 0.003).

However, its effect on uptake rate, i.e., price elasticity of demand, has not been well studied. Methods Japan\u0027s decentralised vaccination programme allows observation of various pairs in price and uptake rate of flu shots among the elderly by the municipality from 2001/2002 to 2004/2005 season. We combine our sample survey data (n =281), which monitor price, subsidy and uptake rate, with published data on local characteristics in order to estimate price elasticity of demand with panel model. Results We find price elasticity of demand for influenza vaccine: nearly zero in nationwide, nearly zero in urban area, and \u22121.07 in rural area. Conclusions The results question the rationale for subsidy, especially in urban area. There are cases where maintaining or increasing the level of subsidy is not an efficient allocation of finite health care resources. When organising a vaccination programme, health manager should be careful about the balance between subsidy and other efforts in order to encourage the elderly to receive shots with price elasticity in mind.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kondo, Masahide; Hoshi, Shu-ling; Okubo, Ichiro","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b0b67f05ddc2d6c1de39deb24c33525ef8e2ba3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126389.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851008002947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19185945/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.12.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851008002947","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["price elasticity of demand","level of subsidy","order","elderly","influenza vaccination","uptake rate of flu shots","urban area","Abstract Objectives Subsidy","rural area","results","Methods Japan\u0027s decentralised vaccination programme","published data","health manager","influenza vaccine","sample survey data","efficient allocation of finite health care resources","observation of various pairs","local characteristics","balance","rationale","efforts","panel model","municipality","mind","Conclusions","developed countries","effect","cases","season"],"language":"en"},

In some host species, for example cattle, pigs, rabbits and human beings, attaching-effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) have an established role as enteropathogens. In other host species, AE bacteria are of less certain significance. With continuing advances in the detection and typing of AE strains, the importance of these bacteria for many hosts is likely to become clearer. The pathogenic effects of AE bacteria result from adhesion to the intestinal mucosa by a variety of mechanisms, culminating in the formation of the characteristic intimate adhesion of the AE lesion. The ability to induce AE lesions is mediated by the co-ordinated expression of some 40 bacterial genes organized within a so-called pathogenicity island, known as the \u201CLocus for Enterocyte Effacement\u201D. It is also believed that the production of bacterial toxins, principally Vero toxins, is a significant virulence factor for some AEEC strains. Recent areas of research into AE bacteria include: the use of Citrobacter rodentium to model human AEEC disease; quorum-sensing mechanisms used by AEEC to modulate virulence gene expression; and the potential role of adhesion in the persistent colonization of the intestine by AE bacteria. This review of AE bacteria covers their molecular biology, their occurrence in various animal species, and the diagnosis, pathology and clinical aspects of animal diseases with which they are associated. Reference is made to human pathogens where appropriate. The focus is mainly on natural colonization and disease, but complementary experimental data are also included.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wales, A. D.; Woodward, M.

Leader sequences have the propensity for forming secondary structures (stem-loops) by base pairing of complementary sequences. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the leader sequence may vary from few nucleotides to more than 1000 nucleotides. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short and at times contain an attenuator segment that is translated to a short-leader peptide. The leader peptide functions to terminate transcripts before the RNA polymerase reaches the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequences in viruses have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and pathogenicity. Mutations in the leader sequences of cellular mRNAs can have implications for disease and tumorigenesis.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samal, S.

Emerging viruses and associated diseases, as well as nosocomial viral infections, have become a real issue in medical fields, and there are very few efficient and specific treatments available to fight most of these infections. Another issue is the potential environmental resistance and spread of viral particles. Therefore, it is essential to properly evaluate the efficacy of antiseptics\u2010disinfectants (ATS\u2010D) on viruses. ATS\u2010D antiviral activity is evaluated by (1) combining viruses and test product for an appropriately defined and precise contact time, (2) neutralizing product activity, and (3) estimating the loss of viral infectivity. A germicide can be considered to have an efficient ATS\u2010D antiviral activity if it induces a \u003E3 or \u003E4 log(10) reduction (American and European regulatory agency requirements, respectively) in viral titers in a defined contact time.

A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People\u0027s Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19.

The reduction did not solely depend on MCO, thus the researchers suggest a further study considering the influencing factors that need to be adhered to in the future.","publish_time":"2020-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdullah, Samsuri; Mansor, Amalina Abu; Napi, Nur Nazmi Liyana Mohd; Mansor, Wan Nurdiyana Wan; Ahmed, Ali Najah; Ismail, Marzuki; Ramly, Zamzam Tuah Ahmad","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4227edd8dee623f386203e95313d70708997cfd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184995.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325390; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353722/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Malaysia Movement Control Order"],"locations":["China","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["MCO","PM2","Department of Environment Malaysia","confirmed COVID","aim","number of cases","Malaysia Movement Control Order","Air Pollutant Index","emissions of hazardous air pollutants","air quality monitoring stations","Coronavirus Disease","novel coronavirus","concentrations variation","high reduction","parts of China","outbreak of respiratory illness","fewer number of motor vehicles","data","road","API","hourly basis","changes of fine particulate matter","nCoV","red zone areas","study","operation of industries","atmosphere","countries","source","influencing factors","result","researchers","world","Wuhan","future"],"language":"en"},

Autophagy has significant associations with neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathies, cancer, programmed cell death, and bacterial and viral infections. During autophagy, a cup-shaped structure, the preautophagosome, engulfs cytosolic components, including organelles, and closes, forming an autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome, leading to the proteolytic degradation of internal components of the autophagosome by lysosomal lytic enzymes. During the formation of mammalian autophagosomes, two ubiquitylation-like modifications are required, Atg12-conjugation and LC3-modification. LC3 is an autophagosomal ortholog of yeast Atg8. A lipidated form of LC3, LC3-II, has been shown to be an autophagosomal marker in mammals, and has been used to study autophagy in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, tumorigenesis, and bacterial and viral infections. The other Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16, are also modified by the same mechanism. In non-starved rats, the tissue distribution of LC3-II differs from those of the lipidated forms of GABARAP and GATE-16, GABARAP-II and GATE-16-II, suggesting that there is a functional divergence among these three modified proteins. Delipidation of LC3-II and GABARAP-II is mediated by hAtg4B. We review the molecular mechanism of LC3-modification, the crosstalk between LC3-modification and mammalian Atg12-conjugation, and the cycle of LC3-lipidation and delipidation mediated by hAtg4B, as well as recent findings concerning the other two Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16. We also highlight recent findings regarding the pathobiology of LC3-modification, including its role in microbial infection, cancer and neuromuscular diseases.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanida, Isei; Ueno, Takashi; Kominami, Eiki","journal":"The International Journal of Biochemistry \u0026 Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cb3c8f07dbe3c6440af5bfe8cdf91880369d323.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129593.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272504002110; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272504002110","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LC3-modification","Delipidation of LC3","cycle of LC3","pathobiology of LC3","lipidated form of LC3","molecular mechanism of LC3","tissue distribution of LC3","GATE","lipidated forms of GABARAP","neurodegenerative diseases","neuromuscular diseases","Atg8 homologues","Abstract Autophagy","cancer","organelles","mammalian Atg12-conjugation","viral infections","recent findings","modified proteins","mammals","hAtg4B","autophagosomal ortholog of yeast Atg8","bulk degradation of proteins","cell viability","proteolytic degradation of internal components","cytosolic components","autophagosomal marker","programmed cell death","formation of mammalian autophagosomes","cardiomyopathies","cellular maintenance","process essential","differentiation","tumorigenesis","microbial infection","preautophagosome","significant associations","role","crosstalk","non-starved rats","cup-shaped structure","ubiquitylation","lysosomal lytic enzymes","modifications","development","functional divergence","closes","lysosome"],"language":"en"},

However, telemedicine as a potential tool during epidemics is not as well considered. Methods In this paper, the application of telemedicine is conceptualised using five possible evidence-based epidemic situations. Results The first situation corresponds to asymptomatic individuals, mainly home-based, living in an epidemic-affected location. The application of telemedicine would be through the use of teleconsultation for emergency medical dispatching and would occur when suspicious symptoms are detected by an individual. The second situation for the application of telemedicine is principally home-based and corresponds to the follow-up telemonitoring of asymptomatic individuals identified as case contacts. Concrete applications of these concepts were used during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Africa since 2014. The third situation links to symptomatic cases in need of isolation. Examples include patients isolated in Taiwan during SARS epidemic in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009, as well as H7N9 influenza infected patients in 2013 in China. The fourth situation involves tele-expertise when local medical resources do not have the technical expertise for the diagnosis or treatment of a patient and support is required from reference centres. The fifth situation corresponds to a healthcare facility under quarantine that would use telemedicine to keep taking care of patients that cannot access the facility, as it was the case in June 2015 in Seoul during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus epidemic. Conclusion The use of telemedicine in epidemic situations has a high potential in improving epidemiological investigations, disease control, and clinical case management. However, since it is a recent application, further research would be needed to gain an improved understanding of how telemedicine could be applied in epidemic situations.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohannessian, R.","journal":"European Research in Telemedicine / La Recherche Europ\u00E9enne en T\u00E9l\u00E9m\u00E9decine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a780571e6a6d6d16ca1a14763017d2fd5e9145fb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212764X15000308; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212764X15000308","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Africa","China","Seoul","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["application of telemedicine","use of telemedicine","epidemic situations","SARS epidemic","Summary Background Telemedicine","clinical situations","situation links","recent application","clinical case management","case contacts","care of patients","use of teleconsultation","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus epidemic","H7N9 influenza infected patients","different medical specialties","local medical resources","emergency medical dispatching","disease control","high potential","technical expertise","tele-expertise","follow-up telemonitoring of asymptomatic individuals","potential tool","Concrete applications","healthcare facility","H1N1 pandemic influenza","Ebola virus disease outbreak","epidemiological investigations","treatment","Seoul","symptomatic cases","support","concepts","diagnosis","Africa","need of isolation","Taiwan","possible evidence","suspicious symptoms","China","quarantine","epidemics","paper","Conclusion","reference centres","Examples","research","Methods","improved understanding","location"],"language":"en"},

The virus is unlike its previous counterparts, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, or anything the world has encountered before both in terms of virulence and severity of the infection. If scientific reports relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are noted, it can be seen that the virus owes much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein, which the viruses utilize as an entry point to gain accesses to its hosts. Recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be targeting; the human brain may soon emerge as the new abode of the virus. Already instances of patients with COVID-19 have been reported with mild (anosmia and ageusia) to severe (encephalopathy) neurological manifestations, and if that is so, then it gives us more reasons to be frightened of this killer virus. Keeping in mind that the situation does not worsen from here, immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the neuroinvasive nature of the virus is the immediate need of the hour.

Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.","publish_time":"2018-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilbertson, Sarah; Federspiel, Joel D; Hartenian, Ella; Cristea, Ileana M; Glaunsinger, Britt","journal":"eLife","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9af3598d5bb039283b8334f770488e6e8e6821c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6203436.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.37663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281021/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytoplasmic mRNA decay","global mRNA decay","mRNA decay landscape","mRNA turnover","Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay","protein localization","RBPs","multiple stages of gene expression","distal stages of gene expression","results","changes","repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein","subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins","relocalized cytoplasmic poly","RNA polymerase","mass spectrometry","human cells","tandem mass tag","tail-associated proteins","gammaherpesviral endonuclease","new role","nuclear translocation","abundance of numerous factors","viral infection","signals","mechanism","promoters","Alterations","data","processes"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Syndrome definitions were created using keyword categorization to extract posts from Twitter. Categories were developed iteratively for four relevant syndromes: respiratory, gastrointestinal, heat-related illness, and influenza-like illness (ILI). All data sources corresponded to the location of Toronto, Canada. Twitter data were acquired from a publicly available stream representing a 1% random sample of tweets from June 26 to September 10, 2015. Cross-correlation analyses of time series data were conducted between Twitter and comparator surveillance data sources: emergency department visits, telephone helpline calls, laboratory testing positivity rate, reportable disease data, and temperature. RESULTS: The frequency of daily tweets that were classified into syndromes was low, with the highest mean number of daily tweets being for ILI and respiratory syndromes (22.0 and 21.6, respectively) and the lowest, for the heat syndrome (4.1). Cross-correlation analyses of Twitter data demonstrated significant correlations for heat syndrome with two data sources: telephone helpline calls (r = 0.4) and temperature data (r = 0.5). CONCLUSION: Using simple syndromes based on keyword classification of geolocated tweets, we found a correlation between tweets and two routine data sources for heat alerts, the only public health event detected during P/PAG. Further research is needed to understand the role for Twitter in surveillance.

This review provides examples of airborne transmission of infectious agents from experimental and field studies and discusses how airborne pathogens can contaminate other parts of the environment to give rise to secondary vehicles leading air-surface-air nexus with possible transmission to susceptible hosts. The following groups of human pathogens are covered because of their known or potential airborne spread: vegetative bacteria (staphylococci and legionellae), fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium spp and Stachybotrys chartarum), enteric viruses (noro- and rotaviruses), respiratory viruses (influenza and coronaviruses), mycobacteria (tuberculous and nontuberculous), and bacterial spore formers (Clostridium difficile and Bacillus anthracis). An overview of methods for experimentally generating and recovering airborne human pathogens is included, along with a discussion of factors that influence microbial survival in indoor air. Available guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other global regulatory bodies for the study of airborne pathogens are critically reviewed with particular reference to microbial surrogates that are recommended. Recent developments in experimental facilities to contaminate indoor air with microbial aerosols are presented, along with emerging technologies to decontaminate indoor air under field-relevant conditions. Furthermore, the role that air decontamination may play in reducing the contamination of environmental surfaces and its combined impact on interrupting the risk of pathogen spread in both domestic and institutional settings is discussed.","publish_time":"2016-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ijaz, M.

In the case of malaria, those links are crucial in relation to the spread of drug resistant parasites and to the elimination of malaria in the Greater Mekong sub-Region (GMS) and beyond. The mobile and migrant populations (MMP) who are involved in forest related activities are both at high risk of being infected with malaria and at risk of receiving late and sub-standard treatment due to poor access to health services. In Cambodia, in 2012, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) identified, as a key objective, the development of a specific strategy for MMPs in order to address these challenges. A population movement framework (PMF) for malaria was developed and operationalized in order to contribute to this strategy. METHODS: A review of the published and unpublished literature was conducted. Based on a synthesis of the results, information was presented and discussed with experienced researchers and programme managers in the Cambodian NMCP and led to the development and refinement of a PMF for malaria. The framework was \u201Ctested\u201D for face and content validity with national experts through a workshop approach. RESULTS: In the literature, HPM has been described using various spatial and temporal dimensions both in the context of the spread of anti-malarial drug resistance, and in the context of malaria elimination and previous classifications have categorized MMPs in Cambodia and the GMS through using a number of different criteria. Building on these previous models, the PMF was developed and then refined and populated with in-depth information relevant to Cambodia collected from social science research and field experiences in Cambodia. The framework comprises of the PMF itself, MMP activity profiles and a Malaria Risk Index which is a summation of three related indices: a vulnerability index, an exposure index and an access index which allow a qualitative ranking of malaria risk in the MMP population. Application of currently available data to the framework illustrates that the highest risk population are those highly mobile populations engaged in forest work. CONCLUSION: This paper describes the process of defining MMPs in Cambodia, identifying the different activities and related risks to appropriately target and tailor interventions to the highest risk groups. The framework has been used to develop more targeted behaviour change and outreach interventions for MMPs in Cambodia and its utility and effectiveness will be evaluated as part of those interventions.","publish_time":"2015-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guyant, Philippe; Canavati, Sara E; Chea, Nguon; Ly, Po; Whittaker, Maxine Anne; Roca-Feltrer, Arantxa; Yeung, Shunmay","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f88f46f2e2fe48b05a5cfefcfbe74f4bc90f574.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4474346.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-015-0773-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26088924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Malaria Control Programme","PMF"],"locations":["Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["Malaria Risk Index","elimination of malaria","case of malaria","context of malaria elimination","qualitative ranking of malaria risk","MMPs","highest risk population","PMF","population movement framework","high risk","National Malaria Control Programme","MMP population","access index","highest risk groups","vulnerability index","exposure index","human population movement","forest related activities","HPM","development","related risks","mobile populations","related indices","GMS","tailor interventions","different activities","outreach interventions","order","results","MMP activity profiles","national experts","poor access","spread of drug resistant parasites","programme managers","Cambodian NMCP","previous classifications","health services","migrant populations","forest work","specific strategy","previous models","unpublished literature","spread of anti-malarial drug resistance","in-depth information relevant","number of different criteria","social science research","Greater Mekong sub-Region","field experiences","face","relationships","summation","content validity","sub-standard treatment","review","temporal dimensions","experienced researchers","concern","links","process","workshop approach","targeted behaviour","global level","key objective","paper","BACKGROUND","available data","utility","refinement","Application","METHODS","CONCLUSION","synthesis","effectiveness","challenges"],"language":"en"},

Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node\u2013specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. Infants harbouring two copies of DC-SIGNR H1 and/or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3, H3-H3) had a 3.6-fold increased risk of in utero (IU) (P = 0.013) HIV-1 infection and a 5.7-fold increased risk of intrapartum (IP) (P = 0.025) HIV-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors. The implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU (P = 0.045 and P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (P = 0.025, for int2-180A) HIV-1 infection. The promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. In homozygous H1 infants bearing both the p-198A and int2-180A mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DC-SIGNR plays a crucial role in MTCT of HIV-1 and that impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission.","publish_time":"2009-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boily-Larouche, Genevi\u00E8ve; Iscache, Anne-Laure; Zijenah, Lynn S.; Humphrey, Jean H.; Mouland, Andrew J.; Ward, Brian J.; Roger, Michel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d12fa6f695fdb75443b00c49514e7850ef461e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2752805.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19809496/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIGNR H1","MTCT of HIV","H1-H1","H1-H3","H3-H3","copies of DC","infection","level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts","HIV-infected mothers","main cause of HIV","H3 haplotypes","implicated H1","potential role of DC","homozygous H1 infants","impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission","int2","increased risk of intrapartum","genetic association study of DC","IU","fold decrease","non-integrin-related","dendritic cell-specific ICAM","expression of membrane","crucial role","promoter region","child transmission","promoter variant","number of maternal factors","maternal-fetal interface","single nucleotide polymorphisms","SNPs","C-type lectin receptor","bound isoforms","lymph node","well-characterized cohort","liver","infant noncarriers","CD209L","utero","transcriptional activity","FINDINGS","Harare","results","BACKGROUND","Zimbabwe","CONCLUSION","intron","children","METHODS","mutations","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 subunit sequence confirmed that strain ck/CH/LJL/111054 is of the Connecticut-type; however, further extensive full-length genomic analysis identified the occurrence of recombination events. Therefore, strain ck/CH/LJL/111054 may have originated from recombination events between Conn- and Mass-like strains at three recombination breakpoints: two located within the nsp3 gene sequence and one in the nsp12 gene sequence. Further, the uptake of the 5\u2032 untranslated regions, nsp2, parts of nsp3, nsp4\u201311, and parts of nsp 12 from Mass-like virus by ck/CH/LJL/111054 might have resulted in changes in viral replication efficiency rather than antigenic changes, via cross-neutralization analysis with the H120 strain.

Reverse-transcription real-time PCR analysis of the quasispecies of a number of Newcastle disease virus field isolates, revealed variable ratios (approximately 1:4\u20131:4,000) of virulent to avirulent viral F0 sequences. Since the ratios of these sequences generally remained constant in the quasispecies population during replication, factors that could affect the balance of virulent to avirulent sequences during viral infection of birds were investigated. It was shown both in vitro and in vivo that virulent virus present in the quasispecies did not emerge from the \u201Cavirulent background\u201D unless a direct selection pressure was placed on the quasispecies, either by growth conditions or by transient immunosuppression.

However, controlled clinical study procedures have evolved substantially since then. We performed a trial using updated methods to evaluate the efficacy of Lantigen B(\u00AE), a chemical BL. This double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center clinical trial had the primary objective of assessing the capacity of Lantigen B to significantly reduce the total number of infectious episodes in patients with RRTI. Secondary aims were the RRTI duration, the frequency and the severity of the acute episodes, the use of drugs and the number of missed workdays. In the subgroup of allergic patients with RRTI, the number of allergic episodes (AE) and the use of anti-allergic drugs were also evaluated. One hundred and sixty patients, 79 allocated to the treated group (TG) and 81 to the placebo group (PG), were enrolled; 30 were lost during the study and 120 (79 females and 38 males) were evaluated. The PG had 1.43 episodes in the 8-months of follow-up while the TG had 0.86 episodes (p = 0.036). A similar result was observed in the allergic patients (1.80 and 0.86 episodes for the PG and the TG, respectively, p = 0.047). The use of antibiotics was reduced (mean 1.24 and 2.83 days of treatment for the TG and the PG). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the estimated risk of needing antibiotics and NSAIDs was reduced by 52.1 and 30.6%, respectively. With regard to the number of AE, no significant difference was observed between the two groups, but bronchodilators, antihistamines and local corticosteroids were reduced by 25.7%, 56.2% and 41.6%, respectively, in the TG. Lantigen B significantly reduced the number of infectious episodes in patients with RRTI. This finding suggests a first line use of this drug for the prophylaxis of infectious episodes in these patients.","publish_time":"2014-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braido, Fulvio; Melioli, Giovanni; Candoli, Piero; Cavalot, Andrea; Di Gioacchino, Mario; Ferrero, Vittorio; Incorvaia, Cristoforo; Mereu, Carlo; Ridolo, Erminia; Rolla, Giovanni; Rossi, Oliviero; Savi, Eleonora; Tubino, Libero; Reggiardo, Giorgio; Baiardini, Ilaria; di Marco, Eddi; Rinaldi, Gilberto; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Accorsi, Carlo; Bossilino, Claudia; Bonzano, Laura; DiLizia, Michela; Fedrighini, Barbara; Garelli, Valentina; Gerace, Vincenzo; Maniscalco, Sara; Massaro, Ilaria; Messi, Alessandro; Milanese, Manlio; Peveri, Silvia; Penno, Arminio; Pizzimenti, Stefano; Pozzo, Tiziana; Raie, Alberto; Regina, Sergio; Sclif\u00F2, Francesca","journal":"Immunol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad5032e9d718b41dcc9fa71e309b82661d2c53a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445613/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247814002521; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247814002521; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2014.10.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lantigen"],"organizations":["RRTI","TG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of allergic episodes","TG","acute episodes","total number of infectious episodes","prophylaxis of infectious episodes","PG","subgroup of allergic patients","number of AE","RRTI duration","use of drugs","use of antibiotics","use of anti-allergic drugs","line use","number of missed workdays","efficacy of Lantigen B","capacity of Lantigen B","placebo group","clinical study procedures","multi-center clinical trial","treated group","prophylactic effect","recurrent respiratory tract infections","primary objective","estimated risk","double blind","bronchodilators","antihistamines","bacterial lysates","frequency","severity","Logistic regression analysis","updated methods","significant difference","local corticosteroids","groups","NSAIDs","Secondary aims","months of follow-up","days of treatment","similar result","females","regard","Studies"],"language":"en"},

In Australia, human, animal and ecological health are managed by separate sectors with limited communication. This study aims to explore how professionals in these fields perceive a One Health approach to zoonotic disease surveillance, aiming to identify the challenges to the implementation of an integrated system in Australia. Using a qualitative research method, ten semistructured interviews were conducted with academic experts to gain insight into the possibility of developing an integrated surveillance system in Australia. A thematic analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings showed the absence of a clear definition and subsequent vision for the future of One Health act as a barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration, and that siloed approaches by different sectors restrict the ability for professionals to work collaboratively across disciplines. An understanding of disease transmission was considered by participants to be a necessary requirement for a successful One Health approach. Finally, participants considered political will an essential requirement for the integration of surveillance systems. This study demonstrates that for a One Health approach to be implemented in an Australian setting, those working in the fields of human, animal and ecological health must agree on several aspects.

The chapter discusses the way by which host genes, acting through a variety of mechanisms, can influence the susceptibility or resistance of animals to neurotropic viruses. It also reviews investigations concerning the role played by individual viral genes and the proteins they encode in determining specific pathways of viral spread to the central nervous system in the infected host. The chapter presents several examples illustrating the current state of knowledge concerning the nature of viral cell attachment proteins and host cell receptors for neurotropic viruses. It also presents examples of the way by which specific viral genetic elements such as enhancers can act to determine the cell-specificity of certain neurotropic viruses.","publish_time":"1988-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tyler, Kenneth L.","journal":"The Molecular Biology of Neurological Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f516fe6d31d1ded664abfc097ab8c00f7c6f60f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151776.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780407024007500135; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780407024007500135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral tropism","viral neurotropism","viral genetic factors","specific viral genetic elements","individual viral genes","specific pathways of viral spread","tropism of viruses","chapter reviews host","nature of viral cell attachment proteins","host cell receptors","certain neurotropic viruses","genetic basis","infected host","cell-specificity","specific emphasis","examples","central nervous system","current state of knowledge","enhancers","Publisher Summary","susceptibility","role","resistance of animals","investigations","variety of mechanisms","recent insights"],"language":"en"},

Since then, significant advances have been made in diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the upper extremity. However, there has been little documentation regarding how the largest and oldest society dedicated to hand surgery has evolved over time. Further, an understanding of the history of the ASSH and the specialty of hand surgery should be emphasized in resident and fellow education. The authors aim to provide a historical overview of the ASSH through the speeches of ASSH past presidents which sheds light on future directions and long-term goals. Presidential addresses from 1961 to 2018 (courtesy of ASSH Chase Library historical archives) were reviewed. The overall percentage of ASSH presidents by specialty was 67% orthopaedic, 25% plastic surgery, and 8% general surgery. The most common speech theme overall was \u201Chow to be a good hand surgeon\u201D (31%). The most common speech themes were as follows by decade: 1960\u2019s, \u201Chistory and the current state of ASSH\u201D; 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s \u201Cassessments of how to be a good surgeon\u201D and \u201Cgoals for ASSH\u201D; 1990\u2019s, \u201Chealthcare and governmental regulation\u201D; 2000\u2019s, \u201Chow to be a better hand surgeon\u201D; 2010\u2019s \u201Cgoals for ASSH\u201D. In earlier years, there was more of a focus on education and technical skill development in the ASSH. Work-life balance, introduced in the 1990s, has become more of a focus in the past 20 years. Revisiting the history of the ASSH and its goals allows us to reflect on the progress made while recognizing what is important as we look into the future.

However, there are no reported candidate agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The authors\u0027 published experimental studies have shown that Epimedium-derived flavonoids possess an anti-ON effect. Further, the authors have recently identified a small molecule Icaritin as an intestinal metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids. OBJECTIVE: The present study was to evaluate the prevention effect of the available semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin on steroid-associated ON development in a rabbit model. METHODS: After receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON, eighty-four male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into the following three daily oral administration groups, including low dose Icaritin group (L-ICT; n = 28; 5 mg\u00B7kg(\u2212 1)\u00B7day(\u2212 1)), high dose Icaritin group (H-ICT; n = 28; 10 mg\u00B7kg(\u2212 1)\u00B7day(\u2212 1)), and control vehicle group (CON; n = 28). Before and after induction, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index. Meanwhile, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation, endothelium injury, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte injury index, while marrow samples were quantified for adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell by in vitro culture and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) protein expression by western blot. At baseline, week 1 and 2 post-induction, 4, 8 and 16 rabbits in each group were sacrificed, respectively. After sacrifice, femora were dissected for micro-CT-based micro-angiography, followed by histological examination of ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis, extravascular fat-cell and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) localized expression. RESULTS: The ON incidence in the L-ICT and H-ICT groups was both significantly lower than that in the CON group (p \u003C 0.05 for both). The ON incidence in the H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (p \u003C 0.05). A significant decrease in the vascularization index and a significant increase in the permeability index seen in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. Reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units was more rarely found in the H-ICT group than in the L-ICT group. Regarding intravascular thrombosis, a significant increase in the thrombotic vessel count, endothelium injury index, coagulation index, and a significant decrease in both the fibrinolysis and oxidative stress index in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. For extravascular lipid-deposition, a significant increase in the fat cell area fraction, adipogenic potential index, PPARgamma expression and lipid-transportation index in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Regarding safety, the hepatocyte injury index did not show significant change from baseline in any group. CONCLUSION: Icaritin, a novel semisynthesized small molecule with osteoprotective potential, exerts dose-dependent effect on reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition. Suppression of the up-regulated PPARgamma expression for extravascular adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells and protection from activated oxidative stress for intravascular endothelium injury were found to be involved in the underlying mechanisms.","publish_time":"2008-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ge; Qin, Ling; Sheng, Hui; Wang, Xin-Luan; Wang, Yi-Xiang; Yeung, David Ka-Wai; Griffith, James F.; Yao, Xin-Sheng; Xie, Xin-Hui; Li, Zi-Rong; Lee, Kwong-Man; Leung, Kwok-Sui","journal":"Bone","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3d78ab5f29fe81e31d6ca71183d8ae136885deb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/376d4b8931d8577a4c08a69246bc4ff39f16a9bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19015051/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328208008223; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2008.10.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S8756328208008223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Icaritin","CON"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H-ICT groups","control vehicle group","low dose Icaritin group","high dose Icaritin group","coagulation index","endothelium injury index","hepatocyte injury index","vascularization index","permeability index","lipid-transportation index","oxidative stress index","extravascular-lipid","significant increase","Intravascular-thrombosis","intravascular thrombosis","intravascular endothelium injury","extravascular lipid-deposition","significant decrease","adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell","significant change","incidence of steroid","extravascular fat-cell","intra-osseous perfusion function index","steroid-associated osteonecrosis","available semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin","regulated PPARgamma expression","protein expression","localized expression","inducing steroid","post-induction","dose-dependent effect","novel semisynthesized small molecule","extravascular adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells","osteoprotective potential","prevention effect","fibrinolysis","blood samples","Epimedium-derived flavonoids","key pathogenic events","development","baseline","day","fat cell area fraction","marrow samples","micro-angiography","micro-CT","Reduced perfusion","thrombotic vessel count","intestinal metabolite of Epimedium","intraosseous blood supply","Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF","daily oral administration groups","proliferator-activated receptor-gamma","week-old New-Zealand white rabbits","proximal femur","vascular endothelial growth factor","protection","culture","lesion","histological examination","dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI","established inductive protocol","western blot","inhibition","present study","experimental studies","structural units","reported candidate agents capable","femora","CONCLUSION","safety","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE","authors\u0027","METHODS","rabbit model","sacrifice","Suppression","underlying mechanisms","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Since 2012, 2,040 cases and 712 deaths have been recorded (as of August 11, 2017), representing a strikingly high case fatality rate of 36%. Over the last several years, MERS-CoV research has progressed in several parallel and complementary directions. This review will focus on three particular areas: the origins and evolution of MERS-CoV, the challenges and achievements in the development of MERS-CoV animal models, and our understanding of how novel proteins unique to MERS-CoV counter the host immune response. The origins of MERS-CoV, likely in African bats, are increasingly clear, although important questions remain about the establishment of dromedary camels as a reservoir seeding human outbreaks. Likewise, there have been important advances in the development of animal models, and both non-human primate and mouse models that seem to recapitulate human disease are now available. How MERS-CoV evades and inhibits the host innate immune response remains less clear. Although several studies have identified MERS-CoV proteins as innate immune antagonists, little of this work has been conducted using live virus under conditions of actual infection, but rather with ectopically expressed proteins. Accordingly, considerable space remains for major contributions to understanding unique ways in which MERS-CoV interacts with and modulates the host response. Collectively, these areas have seen significant advances over the last several years but continue to offer exciting opportunities for discovery.","publish_time":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldstein, Stephen A.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5341fd2caa821b2616a8bc85763a608b29cb4947.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5583735.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.11827.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29026532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV proteins","MERS-CoV research","development of MERS","origins of MERS","evolution of MERS","CoV animal models","host immune response","host response","development of animal models","mouse models","human outbreaks","human disease","novel proteins unique","innate immune antagonists","significant advances","years","important advances","significant research focus","understanding","discovery","non-human primate","unique ways","particular areas","important questions","Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","live virus","major contributions","establishment of dromedary camels","reservoir","African bats","conditions of actual infection","work","challenges","achievements","high case fatality rate","considerable space","exciting opportunities","studies","complementary directions","review","cases","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old female nurse rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after denatonium benzoate fit testing. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium). DIAGNOSES: Due to typical symptoms of asthma after exposure to denatonium benzoate aerosol without any other apparent cause, serial pulmonary function tests indicating obstructive lung function and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E, she was diagnosed with allergic asthma. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, \u03B2(2) agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. OUTCOMES: The patient showed quick responses after treatment with diphenhydramine (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr (inhalation), and prednisolone (oral). Approximately 2 weeks later, she suffered from difficulty breathing and asthmatic symptoms again when she was exposed to polished wax and disinfectant. She was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, \u03B2(2) agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. The patient was in stable condition with improvement in symptoms during follow-up. LESSONS: There may be potentially important health risks when healthcare workers are exposed to denatonium benzoate. Individuals who have a history of allergy to disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium) should avoid exposure of denatonium benzoate. More advanced research is needed in the future.","publish_time":"2019-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Kou-Huang; Chung, Kuo-Mou; Chung, Ju-Hui; Chen, Kow-Tong","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b34166a75b4835a2743fabba60bf7ff23cf0087.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6571374.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124982/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000015818","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exposure of denatonium benzoate","denatonium benzoate aerosol","denatonium benzoate fit testing","PATIENT CONCERNS","agonist","corticosteroid","typical symptoms of asthma","disinfecting products","Xolair","quaternary ammonium","asthmatic symptoms","history of allergy","omalizumab","Symbicort turbuhaler","adverse effects of fit testing","unwanted airborne exposure","healthcare workers","adverse reactions","allergic asthma","obstructive lung function","absolute number of workers","serial pulmonary function tests","apparent cause","developed shortness of breath","cough","agitation","year-old female nurse","higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E","seal","diphenhydramine","quick responses","improvement","crab","relative risk","stable condition","important health risks","useful indicator","inhalation","individual forms","respirator","treatment","mite","fenoterol HBr","prednisolone","difficulty","follow-up","OUTCOMES","RATIONALE","polished wax","disinfectant","advanced research","future","DIAGNOSES","Individuals","weeks","LESSONS","INTERVENTIONS"],"language":"en"},

To develop an effective and specific medicine targeting the SARS-coronavirus (CoV), a chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme was designed and synthesized using a sequence homologous with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). METHOD: Chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting MHV and SARS-CoV were designed and synthesized. To confirm its activity, in vitro cleavage reactions were performed with the synthesized ribozyme. Effects of the chimeric ribozyme were evaluated on multiplication of MHV. Effects of the chimeric ribozyme on expression of SARS-CoV were evaluated in cultured 3T3 cells. RESULT: The synthetic ribozyme cleaved the synthetic target MHV and SARS-CoV RNA into fragments of predicted length. The chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited multiplication of MHV in DBT cells by about 60%. The chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV RNA in 3T3 cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid.

As part of the innate immune response, these enzymes are activated by viral double stranded RNA or mRNAs with significant double stranded structure. The 2-5As in turn activate RNaseL that degrade single stranded RNAs. Three distinct forms of OAS exist in human cells (OAS1, 2 and 3) with each form having multiple spliced variants. The OAS enzymes and their spliced variants have different enzyme activities. OAS enzymes also play a significant role in regulating multiple cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter OAS activity are also associated with viral infection, diabetes and cancer. Thus detection of OAS enzyme activity with a simple spectrophotometric method in cells will be important in clinical research. RESULTS: Here we propose a modified coupled spectrophotometric assay to detect 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzyme activity in prostate cell lines as a model system. The OAS enzyme from prostate cancer cell lysates was purified using Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) bound activated sepharose beads. The activated OAS enzyme eluted from Sepharose beads showed expression of p46 isoform of OAS1, generally considered the most abundant OAS isoform in elutes from DU14 cell line but not in other prostate cell line. In this assay the phosphates generated by the OAS enzymatic reaction is coupled with conversion of the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (methylthioguanosine, a guanosine analogue; MESG) to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase (phosphorylase) using a commercially available pyrophosphate kit. The absorbance of the purine base product is measured at 360 nm. The higher levels of phosphates detected in DU145 cell line indicates more activity of OAS in this prostate cancer cell line. CONCLUSION: The modified simple method detected OAS enzyme activity with sensitivity and specificity, which could help in detection of OAS enzymes avoiding the laborious and radioactive methods.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhosle, Sushma M.; Hunt, Aisha; Chaudhary, Jaideep","journal":"Biol Proced Online","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bffaf7e11f81818a630ae32f752c963664bdc71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4797170.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12575-016-0038-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OAS activity","activity of OAS","activated OAS enzyme","detection of OAS enzymes","detection of OAS enzyme activity","abundant OAS isoform","OAS enzymatic reaction","distinct forms of OAS","prostate cancer cell line","prostate cell lines","DU145 cell line","DU14 cell line","prostate cancer cell lysates","different enzyme activities","interferon inducible enzymes","purine base product","activated sepharose beads","modified simple method","simple spectrophotometric method","significant double stranded structure","viral double stranded RNA","single stranded RNAs","multiple spliced variants","modified coupled spectrophotometric assay","mercapto","catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase","significant role","human cells","expression of p46 isoform of OAS1","viral infection","methylpurine ribonucleoside","oligoadenylate synthetases","multiple cellular processes","higher levels of phosphates","Single nucleotide polymorphisms","mRNAs","MESG","Polyinosinic","ribose1-phosphate","methylthioguanosine","guanosine analogue","conversion","specificity","sensitivity","polycytidylic acid","proliferation","RNaseL","model system","radioactive methods","apoptosis","clinical research","innate immune response","ATP","turn","diabetes","CONCLUSION","absorbance","available pyrophosphate kit","substrate","nm","linked oligomers","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) is an important antigen for the early diagnosis of SARS and the detection of diseases. Here, a new quantum dots (QDs)\u2010conjugated RNA aptamer with high sensitivity and rapidity is proposed for the detection of SARS\u2010CoV N protein using an on chip system. RESULTS: A QDs\u2010conjugated RNA aptamer can specifically hybridize on the immobilized SARS\u2010CoV N protein on the surface of a glass chip. Detection is based on the optical signal variation of a QDs\u2010supported RNA aptamer interacting on an immobilized protein chip. Using an optical QDs\u2010based RNA aptamer chip, SARS N protein was detected at concentrations as low as 0.1 pg mL(\u22121). CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that the QDs\u2010conjugated RNA aptamer could interact on a designed chip specifically and sensitively. This device could form a QDs\u2010conjugated biosensor prototype chip for SARS\u2010CoV N protein diagnosis.

This study aimed to assess ED nurses\u0027 burnout level during an outbreak of MERS-CoV and to identify influencing factors in order to provide basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burnout. Methods Study participants were ED nurses working in eight hospitals designated for treating MERS-CoV-infected patients in Korea. We performed multiple regression analysis to explore the factors influencing burnout. Results The ED nurses\u0027 burnout was affected by job stress (\u03B2=0.59, p \u003C.001), poor hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV (\u03B2 = \u22120.19, p \u003C.001) and poor support from family and friends (\u03B2 = \u22120.14, p \u003C.05). These three variables explained 47.3% of the variance in burnout. Conclusions ED nurses taking care of MERS-CoV-infected patients should be aware that burnout is higher for nurses in their divisions than nurses in other hospital departments and that job stress is the biggest influential factor of burnout. To be ready for the outbreak of emerging contagious diseases such as MERS-CoV, efforts and preparations should be made to reduce burnout. Job stress should be managed and resolved. Working conditions for mitigating job stress and systematic stress management programs should be provided, and hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV need to be reinforced.

In the present study, the antioxidant activities of hot-water extracts from natural and cultured mycelia of C. sinensis were investigated and evaluated using six in vitro assays, including inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation; scavenging abilities on DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals; the reducing power and the chelating ability on ferrous ions. Among these assays, the extracts showed the best effect on the inhibition of linoleic peroxidation with the lowest IC50 values and with an inhibition rate over 90% at concentration of 0.8\u20131.6mg/ml, more stable than that of \u03B1-tocopherol, a recognised natural antioxidant. The scavenging activities on superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals of the two extracts were slightly lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene. DPPH scavenging activities of both extracts reached over 80% inhibition at 4\u20138mg/ml. Both extracts showed moderate reducing power and ferrous ion chelating activity. The IC50 value of the extract from cultured mycelia in all the tests, except for linoleic acid peroxidation, was significantly lower than that of natural mycelia. There was no evident correlation between the antioxidant activity and the content of protein, polysaccharides and mannitol of extracts from C. sinensis; the antioxidant activity may be due to a combined effect of these or some other compounds. These results suggested that both the extracts from cultured and natural mycelia have direct and potent antioxidant activities and that the cultured mycelia of the fungus could be used for the antioxidant activity to reduce the human demands on the natural resources of the fungus, an endangered species.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, C.-H.; Yao, Y.-J.","journal":"LWT - Food Science and Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/097529f4d953e2729951ac0f2ba6a001c6534146.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126362.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2007.05.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002364380700182X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380700182X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287390/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antioxidant activity","natural mycelia","cultured mycelia of","recognised natural antioxidant","antioxidant activities of hot","potent antioxidant activities","water extracts","mannitol of extracts","antioxidant properties","inhibition of linoleic peroxidation","inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation","DPPH scavenging activities","natural resources","inhibition rate","ferrous ion chelating activity","hydroxyl radicals","superoxide anion radicals","scavenging abilities","best effect","fungus","assays","moderate reducing power","Abstract Cordyceps sinensis","chelating ability","ferrous ions","combined effect","lowest IC50 values","best known traditional Chinese medicines","health foods","content of protein","human demands","tests","\u03B1-tocopherol","polysaccharides","wide range of diseases","present study","treatment","evident correlation","endangered species","butylated hydroxytoluene","concentration","compounds","results"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses use deubiquitinases and deISGylases that reverse these modifications and antagonize host signaling processes. We here reveal that the leader protease, Lb(pro), from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) targets ISG15 and to a lesser extent, ubiquitin in an unprecedented manner. Unlike canonical deISGylases that hydrolyze the isopeptide linkage after the C-terminal GlyGly motif, Lb(pro) cleaves the peptide bond preceding the GlyGly motif. Consequently, the GlyGly dipeptide remains attached to the substrate Lys, and cleaved ISG15 is rendered incompetent for reconjugation. A crystal structure of Lb(pro) bound to an engineered ISG15 suicide probe revealed the molecular basis for ISG15 proteolysis.

A total of 145 point mutations and one nucleotide deletion were found relative to the BCoV ENT.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different levels of PEEP on the incidence of atelectasis after heart surgery. Methods: This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that was adopted from a research project recorded in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials. This paper is the result of a research project undertaken at Fatemeh Zahra Hospital (Mazandaran Heart Center) in 2015. 180 patients underwent open heart surgery were selected and were divided randomly into three groups: control, PEEP=8, and PEEP=10 (60 in each group). The patients in the two PEEP8 and PEEP10 intervention groups separately received 8 cm H2O and 10 cm H2O PEEP, respectively, 30 minutes after admission to the ICU for 4 hours and then received 5 cm H2O PEEP until extubation. Atelectasis was examined two hours after the extubation and on the third day after surgery. Results: The incidence rates of atelectasis two hours after extubation on the first day of surgery were 22 (36.7%), 20 (33.3%) and 10 (16.7%) patients in the control, PEEP8 and PEEP10 groups, respectively. The differences were statistically significant among the three groups (p=0.035). The incidence rates of atelectasis on the third day after surgery were 39 (65%), 36 (60%) and 21 (35%) patients in the control, PEEP8 and PEEP10 groups, respectively. The differences were also statistically significant among the three groups (p=0.003). Conclusion: The use of 10 cm H2O PEEP can lead to a reduction in the incidence of atelectasis, intubation time at the ICU and length of ICU and hospital stay. Given that this level of PEEP is effective, this method is recommended to be used in postoperative care of patients.","publish_time":"2018-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setak-Berenjestanaki, Mostafa; Bagheri-Nesami, Masoumeh; Gholipour Baradari, Afshin; Mousavinasab, Seyed Nouraddin; Ghaffari, Rahman; Darbeheshti, Manijeh","journal":"Med J Islam Repub Iran","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d186611ecffce20666431e3e9988308833c0236.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6108254.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14196/mjiri.32.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H2O PEEP","incidence of atelectasis","level of PEEP","PEEP10 groups","incidence rates of atelectasis","day of surgery","PEEP10 intervention groups","PEEP8","hours","extubation","open heart surgery","effect of different levels of PEEP","postoperative care of patients","research project","length of ICU","differences","Mazandaran Heart Center","beneficial level","Fatemeh Zahra Hospital","use of positive end-expiratory pressure","intubation time","Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials","double-blind randomized controlled trial","minutes","reduction","Background","ways","important role","admission","Results","study","Methods","consensus","paper","aim","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The VPs are clusters of small vesicle compartments and are considered to be the site of viral genome replication. The CMs are electron-dense amorphous structures observed in proximity to the VPs, but the exact roles of CMs are mostly unknown.

It is urgent to develop a novel candidate against TGEV entry. Bacillus subtilis is a probiotic with excellent anti-microorganism properties and one of its secretions, surfactin, has been regarded as a versatile weapon for most plant pathogens, especially for the enveloped virus. We demonstrate for the first time that B. subtilis OKB105 and its surfactin can effectively inhibit one animal coronavirus, TGEV, entering the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Then, several different experiments were performed to seek the might mechanisms. The plaque assays showed that surfactant could reduce the plaque generation of TGEV in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, after incubation with TGEV for 1.5 h, B. subtilis could attach TGEV particles to their surface so that the number of virus to bind to the host cells was declined. Furthermore, our data showed that the inhibition of B. subtilis was closely related to the competition with TGEV for the viral entry receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and aminopeptidase N (APN) protein. In addition, Western blotting and apoptosis analysis indicated that B. subtilis could enhance the resistance of IPEC-J2 cells by up-regulating the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-6 and reducing the percentage of apoptotic cells. Taken together, our results suggest that B. subtilis OKB105 and its surfactin can antagonize TGEV entry in vitro and may serve as promising new candidates for TGEV prevention.","publish_time":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaoqing; Hu, Weiwei; Zhu, Liqi; Yang, Qian","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/603e11d248463c9b79a1030663946c5640810536.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5469330.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270576/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20170082","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV entry","TGEV prevention","TGEV particles","plaque generation of TGEV","subtilis OKB105","Bacillus subtilis","J2 cells","surfactin","Intestinal epithelial cells","host cells","IPEC-J2","enveloped virus","number of virus","percentage of apoptotic cells","viral entry receptors","resistance of IPEC","plaque assays","intestinal porcine epithelial cell line","epidermal growth factor receptor","EGFR","probiotic","targets","transmissible gastroenteritis","aminopeptidase N","excellent anti-microorganism properties","apoptosis analysis","plant pathogens","promising new candidates","addition","Western blotting","APN","surfactant","surface","novel candidate","competition","dose-dependent manner","animal coronavirus","versatile weapon","protein","secretions","expression of toll","infection","TLR","inhibition of","incubation","time","results","different experiments","data","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Following sublingual (SL) administration, AcHERV-triHPV was absorbed and distributed throughout the body. At 15 minutes and 1 day post-dose, the distribution of AcHERV-triHPV to the lung was higher than that to other tissues. At 30 days post-dose, the levels of AcHERV-triHPV had diminished throughout the body. Six weeks after the first of three doses, 1\u00D710(8) copies of SL AcHERV-triHPV induced HPV type-specific serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies to a degree comparable to that of IM immunization with 1\u00D710(9) copies. AcHERV-triHPV induced HPV type-specific vaginal IgA titers in a dose-dependent manner. SL immunization with 1\u00D710(10) copies of AcHERV-triHPV induced Th1 and Th2 cellular responses comparable to IM immunization with 1\u00D710(9) copies.

The PEDV is one of the major concerns of the pig industry around the world, including Asian countries and Noth America since first identified in Europe. Currently, there is no PEDV licensed vaccine to effectively prevent this disease. This study was performed for the development of a mucosal PEDV vaccine and B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) as a carrier was employed to surpass the tolerogenic nature of GALT and induce potent immune responses against the target antigen fused to CTB. An epitope (S1D) alone or conjugated with CTB was constructed into the tobacco chloroplasts expression vector which is controlled under the chloroplast rRNA operon promoter with T7g10 5\u2032 UTR and the psbA 3\u2032UTR as a terminator. The homoplastomic lines were obtained by third round screening via organogenesis from the leaf tissues which were verified by PCR with antigen and chloroplast specific primers and then confirmed by Southern blot analysis. While the expression level of the S1D alone as detected by Western blotting was approximately 0.07% of total soluble protein, the CTB-S1D fusion protein was expressed up to 1.4%. The fusion protein showed binding to the intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor, demonstrating its functionality. The result shows that the highest expression of S1D could be achieved by fusion with a stable CTB protein and chloroplast transformation. Furthermore, the CTB-S1D expressed in chloroplasts of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Maryland could be assembled to pentameric form which increases the possibility to develop a mucosal vaccine against PEDV.","publish_time":"2019-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tien, Nguyen-Quang-Duc; Huy, Nguyen-Xuan; Kim, Mi-Young","journal":"Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f47b0b1d2688551d04874af0053cc6297466bd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089040.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01562-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","GALT","CTB"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["CTB-S1D fusion protein","stable CTB protein","mucosal PEDV vaccine","PEDV licensed vaccine","highest expression of S1D","mucosal vaccine","chloroplast transformation","total soluble protein","UTR","expression level","tobacco chloroplasts expression vector","chloroplast specific primers","acute diarrhea","target antigen","chloroplast rRNA operon promoter","chloroplasts of Nicotiana tabacum","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","B subunit of cholera toxin","potent immune responses","T7g10","PCR","intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor","higher mortality","round screening","piglets","world","Maryland","pigs","binding","Noth America","Asian countries","pig industry","leaf tissues","tolerogenic nature of GALT","organogenesis","psbA","major concerns","possibility","coronavirus family","development","result shows","Southern blot analysis","pentameric form","carrier","homoplastomic lines","weeks old","Western blotting","Europe","functionality","terminator","disease","study","epitope"],"language":"en"},

The 176,688 nt sequence, which is believed to encompass the complete coding region of the virus, is 67% A\u002BT and is predicted to encode 191 genes. 11 of these genes have no counterpart in GenBank and are therefore unique to EPTV. The presence of a distantly related ortholog of Vaccinia virus F5L in EPTV uncovered a link with fragmented F5L orthologs in Molluscum contagiosum virus/squirrelpox and clade II viruses. Consistent with the unique position of EPTV approximately mid-point between the orthopoxviruses and the clade II viruses, EPTV has 11 genes that are specific to the orthopoxviruses and 13 genes that are typical, if not exclusive, to the clade II poxviruses. This mosaic nature of EPTV blurs the distinction between the old description of the orthopoxvirus and clade II groups. Genome annotation and characterization failed to find any common virulence genes shared with the other poxvirus isolated from bat (pteropoxvirus); however, EPTV encodes 3 genes that may have been transferred to or from deerpox and squirrelpox viruses; 2 of these, a putative endothelin-like protein and a MHC class I-like protein are likely to have immunomodulatory roles.

We deep-sequence longitudinal samples from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections. We find parallel evolution across three scales: within individual patients, in different patients in our study, and in the global influenza population. In hemagglutinin, a small set of mutations arises independently in multiple patients. These same mutations emerge repeatedly within single patients and compete with one another, providing a vivid clinical example of clonal interference. Many of these recurrent within-host mutations also reach a high global frequency in the decade following the patient infections.

The present study aimed to develop a simple method to estimate the CFR based on readily available datasets, that is, confirmed cases and deaths, while addressing some of the known technical issues. To assess the reliability and validity of the proposed method, we examined the minimum length of time required for the assigned CFR to be included within the 95% confidence intervals and for the estimated CFR to be below a prespecified cut-off value by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the smaller the transmission potential was, the longer it took to compare the estimated CFR against the cut-off value.

Despite the many studies carried out over decades to determine the etiologic agents of RSS involved in the disease, several outbreaks remained without the elucidation of, potentially multiple, etiologies involved. METHODS: We performed comparative analysis of viral metagenomes from four chicken flocks affected with RSS using next-generation sequencing. Primers for the detection of chicken enteric viruses were designed from the sequencing data obtained with metagenomics. Multiplex reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR were performed to detect a variety of etiological agents previously described in natural cases of RSS. RESULTS: The most abundant viral families identified in this study were Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae and Picobirnaviridae. Chicken astrovirus sequences were present in all four samples, suggesting an association between chicken astrovirus and RSS and chicken astrovirus as a candidate pathogen responsible for RSS. Picobirnavirus and the newly identified chapparvovirus were found in chickens in the Republic of Korea for the first time, and the genetic diversity of enteric viruses and viral communities was showed. CONCLUSIONS: Chicken astrovirus was consistently detected in broilers affected with RSS and the result of this study may contribute to knowledge of enteric diseases and viruses in chickens.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hye-Ryoung; Kwon, Yong-Kuk; Jang, Il; Bae, You-Chan","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bd3aaa2f3ee6d82b6b94051755fb751ad66652c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157833.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01307-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293477/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","RSS"],"locations":["Republic"],"keyphrases":["Chicken astrovirus sequences","chicken flocks","etiologic agents of RSS","detection of chicken enteric viruses","chickens","natural cases of RSS","study","genetic diversity of enteric viruses","PCR","viral communities","results","abundant viral families","knowledge of enteric diseases","comparative analysis of viral metagenomes","malabsorption syndrome","sequencing data","generation sequencing","identified chapparvovirus","Runting-stunting syndrome","variety of etiological agents","clinical signs","Parvoviridae","polymerase chain reaction","typical histopathologic examination","Caliciviridae","candidate pathogen responsible","Picornaviridae","Astroviridae","considerable economic losses","severe enteritis","reverse transcription","Reoviridae","time","AIMS","samples","broilers","association","elucidation","Picobirnaviridae","BACKGROUND","decades","Republic of Korea","Primers","etiologies","outbreaks","METHODS","Picobirnavirus","metagenomics","CONCLUSIONS","studies"],"language":"en"},

An important characteristic of mucosal vaccination is its ability to elicit local immune responses, which act against infection at the site of pathogen entry. However, mucosal surfaces are endowed with potent and sophisticated tolerance mechanisms to prevent the immune system from overreacting to the many environmental antigens. Hence, mucosal vaccination may suppress the immune system instead of induce a protective immune response. Therefore, mucosal adjuvants and/or special antigen delivery systems as well as appropriate dosage forms are required in order to develop potent mucosal vaccines. Whereas oral, nasal and pulmonary vaccine delivery strategies have been described extensively, the sublingual and buccal routes have received considerably less attention. In this review, the characteristics of and approaches for sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery are described and compared with other mucosal vaccine delivery sites. We discuss recent progress and highlight promising developments in the search for vaccine formulations, including adjuvants and suitable dosage forms, which are likely critical for designing a successful sublingual or buccal vaccine. Finally, we outline the challenges, hurdles to overcome and formulation issues relevant for sublingual or buccal vaccine delivery.","publish_time":"2014-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kraan, Heleen; Vrieling, Hilde; Czerkinsky, Cecil; Jiskoot, Wim; Kersten, Gideon; Amorij, Jean-Pierre","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d9570dc2bc7eecd456528a0e10de0530388d002.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114675.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.05.060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24911355/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365914003861; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914003861","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["buccal vaccine delivery","mucosal vaccine delivery sites","mucosal adjuvants","sublingual","mucosal tissues","mucosal surfaces","vaccine formulations","potent mucosal vaccines","pulmonary vaccine delivery strategies","immune system","important characteristic of mucosal vaccination","buccal routes","special antigen delivery systems","local immune responses","protective immune response","appropriate dosage forms","suitable dosage forms","target sites","immunological competence","attractive administration","formulation issues relevant","large surface area","order","ability","approaches","promising developments","infection","search","sophisticated tolerance mechanisms","hurdles","overreacting","site of pathogen entry","recent progress","Abstract","characteristics","environmental antigens","challenges","review","attention"],"language":"en"},

This, in turn, results in exclusive inclusion of the downstream exon P3A. The P3A(\u002B) transcript encodes a non-functional \u03B1 subunit that comprises 50% of the transcripts in normal human skeletal muscle, but its functional significance remains undetermined. In an effort to search for a potential therapy, we screened off-label effects of 960 bioactive chemical compounds and found that tannic acid ameliorates the aberrant splicing due to IVS3-8G\u003EA but without altering the expression of hnRNP H. Therefore, we searched for another splicing trans-factor. We found that the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) binds close to the 3\u2032 end of CHRNA1 intron 3, that PTB induces skipping of exon P3A and that tannic acid increases the expression of PTB in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion assays of the PTB promoter region revealed that the tannic acid-responsive element is between positions \u2212232 and \u221274 from the translation initiation site. These observations open the door to the discovery of novel therapies based on PTB overexpression and to detecting possible untoward effects of the overexpression.","publish_time":"2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bian, Yang; Masuda, Akio; Matsuura, Tohru; Ito, Mikako; Okushin, Kazuya; Engel, Andrew G.; Ohno, Kinji","journal":"Human Molecular Genetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b47cb04a54a8bc6912840fa8ea1b0cf5f8084fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2655771.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddp023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19147685/; https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-pdf/18/7/1229/17248462/ddp023.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PTB overexpression","expression of PTB","PTB promoter region","tannic acid-responsive element","splicing repressor","downstream exon P3A","expression of hnRNP","non-functional \u03B1 subunit","splicing trans-factor","muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03B1 subunit","label effects","intronic splice-site mutation IVS3","possible untoward effects","end of CHRNA1 intron","translation initiation site","normal human skeletal muscle","polypyrimidine tract binding protein","exclusive inclusion","bioactive chemical compounds","discovery of novel therapies","functional significance","door","results","turn","transcripts","Deletion assays","dose-dependent manner","positions","potential therapy","effort","observations"],"language":"en"},

Astrocytes are the major target for MHV persistence. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive MHV infection and permit viral persistence are not known. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte DBT cells by MHV infection and found that the mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased following MHV infection. This finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and BNip3-promoter-luciferase reporter system. Interestingly, infection with live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses equally repressed BNip3 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry. Furthermore, treatment of cells with chloroquine, which blocks the acidification of endosomes, significantly inhibited the repression of the BNip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588-base-pair BNip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the BNip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for MHV-induced down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells. These results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes.","publish_time":"2003-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Yingyun; Liu, Yin; Yu, Dongdong; Zhang, Xuming","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/174343198c4b635e037881d4492f9cee627b14bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125541.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203006032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203006032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","DBT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BNip3-promoter","regulation of BNip3 expression","MHV persistence","repressed BNip3 expression","BNip3 promoter activity","following MHV infection","proapoptotic gene BNip3","base-pair BNip3 promoter","differential gene expression","viral persistence","cell entry","treatment of cells","host astrocytes","astrocyte DBT cells","acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60","Deletion analysis","cell membranes","cell survival","mechanisms","Western blot analysis","DNA microarray analysis","virus replication","viral envelope","host antiviral defense","luciferase reporter system","central nervous system of susceptible rodents","Abstract Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","polymerase chain reaction","ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses","quantitative reverse transcription","encephalitis","fusion","demyelination","mRNA","repression","major target","signals","sequence","chloroquine","insights","acidification of endosomes","finding","results","nucleotides","endocytosis"],"language":"en"},

There have been different names for the greater China area, such as \u2018the Chinese circle\u2019, \u2018the Chinese community\u2019, \u2018the greater China community\u2019, \u2018China economic circle\u2019, \u2018Chinese economic area\u2019, \u2018China economic zone\u2019, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term \u2018Greater China\u2019 was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term \u2018Greater China\u2019 is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the \u2018three democratisms\u2019 to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371\u20131435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people \u2013 many of them Cantonese and Hokkien \u2013 to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong\u2019s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

PED virus (PEDV) spread for the first time into the USA in 2013 and has caused severe economic losses. Retrospectively, it was found that two different strains of PEDV have been introduced into the United States, both are closely related to strains circulating in China where a new wave of the disease occurred from 2010 onwards. Since autumn 2014, new outbreaks of PED have occurred in Europe. In this study, weaned piglets were inoculated with an early European isolate (Br1/87) or faecal/intestinal suspensions derived from pigs infected with a recent European strain of PEDV (from Germany) or a US strain of PEDV. No evidence for infection resulted from inoculation of pigs with the German sample that contained high levels of PEDV RNA; there were no clinical signs, excretion of viral RNA or anti\u2010PEDV antibody production. In contrast, all the pigs in the other two groups showed evidence of infection. Mild clinical signs of disease, mainly diarrhoea, occurred in piglets inoculated with the Br1/87 and US PEDV strains. PEDV RNA was detected throughout the intestine in euthanized animals at 4 days post\u2010inoculation. In addition, within these animals, low levels of viral RNA were detected in lungs and livers with higher levels in spleens. Seroconversion against PEDV occurred in all surviving infected animals within 10 days. PEDV RNA excretion occurred for at least 2 weeks. The US PEDV RNA was detected at low levels in serum samples on multiple days. It is apparent that current diagnostic systems can detect infection by the different virus strains.","publish_time":"2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lohse, L.; Krog, J.

It is a small protein of 98 amino acids and its structure has been solved recently. 9b is known to localize in the extra-nuclear region and has been postulated to possess a nuclear export signal (NES), however the role of NES in 9b functioning is not well understood. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/METHODOLOGY: In this report, we demonstrate that 9b in the absence of any nuclear localization signal (NLS) enters the nucleus by passive transport. Using various cell cycle inhibitors, we have shown that the nuclear entry of 9b is independent of the cell cycle. Further, we found that 9b interacts with the cellular protein Crm1 and gets exported out of the nucleus using an active NES. We have also revealed that this NES activity influences the half-life of 9b and affects host cell death. We found that an export signal deficient SARS-CoV 9b protein induces apoptosis in transiently transfected cells and showed elevated caspase-3 activity. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we showed that nuclear shuttling of 9b and its interaction with Crm1 are essential for the proper degradation of 9b and blocking the nuclear export of this protein induces apoptosis. This phenomenon may be critical in providing a novel role to the 9b accessory protein of SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2011-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Kulbhushan; \u00C5kerstr\u00F6m, Sara; Sharma, Anuj Kumar; Chow, Vincent T.

While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate type-I Interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS-CoV-2 in the context of type I IFN induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS-CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even in the presence of type I IFN pretreatment. Next, we examined IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells finding SARS-CoV-2 had reduced viral replication relative to SARS-CoV and induced STAT1 phosphorylation late during infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN-I response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lokugamage, Kumari G; Hage, Adam; Schindewolf, Craig; Rajsbaum, Ricardo; Menachery, Vineet D","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/960732b8d97d746a065188436b88f8b26af9ab4b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/90c2e4515564fd0a9a81f79a0b0c1733f05250a8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.982264","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["original SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV infection","novel CoV","sensitivity of SARS","IFN pretreatment","key IFN antagonists","phosphorylation of STAT1","viral proteins","viral replication relative","induced STAT1 phosphorylation","similar viral replication kinetics","IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells","increased ISG proteins","interferon antagonist","presence of type","context of type","results","ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia","interferon stimulated gene","B CoVs","treatment options","key differences","novel coronavirus","similar genome organization","group","evidence","origins","ORF6","induction","transcriptional factor activation","equivalent function","Vero cell","coronaviruses","susceptibility","insights","absence of open reading frame","response","significant changes","animal model development","public health strategies","disease progression","world","initial guidance","contrast","homology","bats","report"],"language":"en"},

This is integral to the maintenance of healthy lungs, which are free from infection and efficient at gaseous exchange. An important component of innate immunity for identifying viruses is the family of C-type collagen-containing lectins, also known as collectins. These secreted, soluble proteins are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral glycoproteins. These innate immune proteins are composed of trimerized units which oligomerise into higher-order structures and facilitate the clearance of viral pathogens through multiple mechanisms. Similarly, many viral surface proteins form trimeric configurations, despite not showing primary protein sequence similarities across the virus classes and families to which they belong. In this review, we discuss the role of the lung collectins, i.e., surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) in viral recognition. We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved. Recombinant versions of these innate immune proteins may have therapeutic potential in a range of infectious and inflammatory lung diseases including anti-viral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2018-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watson, Alastair; Phipps, Maximillian J.S.; Clark, Howard W.; Skylaris, Chris-Kriton; Madsen, Jens","journal":"J Innate Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/868b9ab09cae7afe1d1e2ad2f547adecd4d18ac6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6738215.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000492974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30293076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral recognition","viral surface proteins","innate immune proteins","trimeric viral fusion proteins","viral glycoproteins","soluble proteins","surfactant proteins","clearance of viral pathogens","trimeric collectins","anti-viral therapeutics","Innate recognition of viruses","lung collectins","trimeric configurations","immune response","SP-D","important component of innate immunity","pattern recognition receptors","inflammatory lung diseases","range of infectious","trimerized units","primary protein sequence similarities","therapeutic potential","virus classes","infection","oligomerise","higher-order structures","family of C","PAMPs","PRRs","maintenance of healthy lungs","type collagen","complementarity","multiple mechanisms","Recombinant versions","gaseous exchange","molecular patterns","structural similarity","families","role","review"],"language":"en"},

As a result of these shortages, many health care providers have temporarily used largely untested, improvised PPE (iPPE). Lack of quality control for makeshift PPE and frequent repurposing of used items to conserve supplies increases both the risk of provider infection and nosocomial spread to uninfected patients. One strategy to reduce risk of infection and preserve existing equipment is the implementation of secondary barrier devices placed directly over patients or providers. The authors describe an inexpensive, disposable, positive-pressure head isolation unit that can be rapidly constructed from materials readily available in nearly all health care settings for under five US dollars. The unit was successfully deployed in Taiwan during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and again during the COVID-19 pandemic. The iPPE worn directly by the health care workers (HCWs) can be donned prior to patient contact in the presence of an air source. This strategy may be more protective than a covering placed over the patient in an aerosol-generating environment, which requires the HCW to be in close contact with the patient prior to securing the protective device.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chien, Li-Chien; Be\u00FF, Christian K; Koenig, Kristi L","journal":"Prehospital and disaster medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x20000643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398188/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","HCW"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["health care providers","health care settings","health care workers","health care system resources","patient contact","makeshift PPE","improvised PPE","risk of infection","pandemic","protective device","iPPE","COVID","strategy","risk of provider infection","medical-grade personal protective equipment","existing equipment","uninfected patients","close contact","frequent repurposing of used items","positive-pressure head isolation unit","combination of increased demand","nosocomial spread","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","disrupted manufacturing supply chains","implementation of secondary barrier devices","SARS","outbreak","Lack of quality control","supplies","availability of life","Taiwan","presence","shortages","HCWs","US dollars","environment","air source","authors","aerosol","materials","result","covering"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19). METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included. All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected. Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020. RESULTS: The study cohort included 102 adult patients. The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female. A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster. Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%). Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities. They were also less likely suffered from complications. There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups. Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs. 35.3%). Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs. 12.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis. Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU. Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission. There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Jianlei; Tu, Wen-Jun; Cheng, Wenlin; Yu, Lei; Liu, Ya-Kun; Hu, Xiaoyong; Liu, Qiang","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cf98142930dbcbe7b6815c99a6be9fb851fd41d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239127/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa243","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital","ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["death patients","adult patients","short-term outcomes of patients","COVID","likely required admission","human transmission","outcomes data","laboratory tests treatment","health care workers","laboratory features","drug treatment rates","glucocorticoid drug treatment","nosocomial transmission","source of transmission","study cohort","China","infection results","years","mortality rate","ICU","Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital","intensive care unit","familial clustering of cases","development of systemic complications","hospital setting","radiological characteristics","severity of disease","Patient characteristics","data support","Corona Virus Disease","non-survival groups","series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause","underlying diseases","onset","illness","Chest imaging examination","Hubei","ground-glass opacity","visitors","IQR","age","criteria","inclusion","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","median","analysis","comorbidities","METHODS","female","differences","discharge","total","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge management theory has the potential to support research into problems such as HIV, antibiotic resistance and others, particularly in terms of aspects of scientific research related to the contribution of social science. To date, however, these challenges remain with us, and theoretical contributions that can complement natural science efforts to eradicate these problems are needed. This paper seeks to offer a theoretical contribution grounded in Kuhn\u2019s paradigm theory of innovation, and in the argument by Lakatos that scientific research can be fundamentally non-innovative, which suggests that social science aspects of knowledge creation may hold the key to more effective biomedical innovation. Given the consequences of ongoing and emerging global crises, and the failure of knowledge systems of scientific research to solve such problems outright, this paper provides a review of theory and literature arguing for a new paradigm in scientific research, based on the development of global systems to maximise research collaborations. A global systems approach effectively includes social science theory development as an important complement to the natural sciences research process. Arguably, information technology and social media technology have developed to the point at which solutions to knowledge aggregation challenges can enable solutions to knowledge problems on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Expert and non-expert crowdsourced inputs can enable problem-solving through exponentially increasing problem-solving inputs, using the \u2018crowd,\u2019 thereby increasing collaborations dramatically. It is argued that these developments herald a new era of participatory research, or a democratisation of research, which offers new hope for solving global social problems. This paper seeks to contribute to this end, and to the recognition of the important role of social theory in the scientific research process.","publish_time":"2017-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callaghan, Chris William","journal":"SAHARA J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0833a1c57d22b36db54876afb2282e00148b691.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5639607.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922967/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17290376.2017.1375426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["knowledge problems","research collaborations","scientific research process","democratisation of research","research processes","management of knowledge","Knowledge management theory","failure of knowledge systems of scientific research","global social problems","social science theory development","social science aspects of knowledge creation","contribution of social science","new era of participatory research","natural sciences research process","knowledge aggregation challenges","important role of social theory","social media technology","review of theory","development of global systems","paper","new paradigm","Kuhn\u2019s paradigm theory of innovation","natural science efforts","solutions","important complement","new hope","emerging global crises","problem-solving inputs","non-expert crowdsourced inputs","information technology","theoretical contributions","terms of aspects","effective biomedical innovation","key","point","potential","consequences of ongoing","recognition","literature","HIV","scale","argument","antibiotic resistance","developments","Lakatos","field","end","date"],"language":"en"},

Griffithsin, a red algal lectin, has potent antiviral effect on several human enveloped viruses, but this effect has not been demonstrated on PRRSV. Here, we first tested the in vitro antiviral activity of Griffithsin against PRRSV. Griffithsin exerted strong saccharide-dependent antiviral activity against PRRSV, probably through interactions with glycans on the surface of PRRSV that interfered with virus entry. Furthermore we revealed that Griffithsin\u2019s action on PRRSV involved blocking viral adsorption, and it had no effect on viral penetration. Besides Our findings also suggested that Griffithsin may interfere with cell-to-cell spread to prevent virus transmission.

Greasy grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis viruses (GGNNV) were investigated for their apoptotic activity in culture cells. GGNNV infection of sea bass (SB) cells appeared to induce a typical cytopathic effect (CPE), i.e., cytoplasmic vacuolation, thinning, rounding up, detachment of infected cells from the cultured dish, and eventually cell lysis and death. The infected SB cells underwent DNA fragmentation and stained positive in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, suggesting that GGNNV infection induced apoptosis in SB cells. In addition, GGNNV-infected SB cells showed an increased activity of caspase-8-like proteases (IETDase) and caspase-3-like proteases (IETDase), whereas inhibitor of caspase-8 and caspase-3 reduced GGNNV-induced apoptosis. This suggests that GGNNV may promote apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in SB cells. Protein \u03B1, the precursor of GGNNV capsid proteins, was transiently expressed in SB and Cos-7 cells. The DNA fragmentation and TUNEL positive signal were apparent in SB and Cos-7 cells expressing protein \u03B1, suggesting that protein \u03B1 may serve as an apoptotic inducer in these cells. Moreover, expression of protein \u03B1 resulted in the activation of caspase-3-like proteases in both cells, which could be inhibited by a caspase-3-like protease specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO peptide. These results suggest that fish caspases are important elements in GGNNV-meditated apoptosis.","publish_time":"2003-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Yan Xiang; Wei, Ting; Dallmann, Klara; Kwang, Jimmy","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e33b76b80fda61ff92eefeb888b99a6b77fdd36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126978.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202000983; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202000983","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SB","GGNNV"],"locations":["Asia","Europe","Australia"],"keyphrases":["GGNNV-infected SB cells","culture cells","detachment of infected cells","GGNNV-meditated apoptosis","inhibitor of caspase","reduced GGNNV-induced apoptosis","activation of caspase","GGNNV infection of sea bass","expression of protein \u03B1","increased activity of caspase","proteases","precursor of GGNNV capsid proteins","DNA fragmentation","fish caspases","apoptotic activity","Cos","IETDase","TUNEL positive signal","nervous necrosis viruses","apoptotic inducer","wide range of marine fish species","causative agents of viral nervous necrosis","protease specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO peptide","TdT","Asia","terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase","Epinephelus tauvina","important elements","juveniles","Europe","Nodaviridae family","mediated dUTP nick-end","CPE","Australia","larvae","Greasy grouper","high mortality","cultured dish","extrinsic pathway","members","Martinique","assay","typical cytopathic effect","addition","Abstract Betanodaviruses","lysis","results","cytoplasmic vacuolation","Tahit","death"],"language":"en"},

To date, published studies describe SGTA as a protein that is potentially critical in a range of biological processes, including viral infection, cell division, mitosis, and cell cycle checkpoint activation. SGTA interacts with the molecular chaperones, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP90, and with steroid receptor complexes, including those containing the androgen receptor. Steroid receptors are critical for maintaining cell growth and differentiation in hormonally regulated tissues, such as male and female reproductive tissues, and also play a role in disease states involving these tissues. There is growing evidence that, through its interactions with chaperones and steroid receptors, SGTA may be a key player in the pathogenesis of hormonally influenced disease states, including prostate cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome. Research into the function of SGTA has been conducted in several model organisms and cell types, with these studies showing that SGTA functionality is cell-specific and tissue-specific. However, very few studies have been replicated in multiple cell types or experimental systems. Although a broad range of functions have been attributed to SGTA, there is a serious lack of mechanistic information to describe how SGTA acts. In this review, published evidence linking SGTA with hormonally regulated disease states is summarized and discussed, highlighting the need for future research to more clearly define the biological function(s) of this potentially important co-chaperone.

Recognition of the various forms of CHV-induced disease, availability of diagnostic assays with increased sensitivity, and the formation of reliable biosecurity measures will allow for better control steps.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evermann, James F.; Ledbetter, Eric C.; Maes, Roger K.","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0dfd00ebde7ca0adb30e41aee2b4abed598603b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114841.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561611001562; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvsm.2011.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22041206/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195561611001562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various forms of CHV infection","latent carriers of CHV","availability of diagnostic assays","sensitive diagnostic assays","high-risk dog populations","induced disease","knowledge base","increased sensitivity","formation of reliable biosecurity measures","clinical inquiry","canine herpesvirus","better control steps","veterinary community","review documents","increases","Recognition","decade"],"language":"en"},

The S is a multifunctional glycoprotein that mediates both attachment of CoV particles to cell surface receptor molecules as well as membrane penetration by fusion. Receptor-binding domains (RBD) have been identified in the S of diverse CoV; they usually contain antigenic determinants targeted by antibodies that neutralize CoV infections. To penetrate host cells, the CoV can use various cell surface molecules, although they preferentially bind to ectoenzymes. Several crystal structures have determined the folding of CoV RBD and the mode by which they recognize cell entry receptors. Here we review the CoV\u2013receptor complex structures reported to date, and highlight the distinct receptor recognition modes, common features, and key determinants of the binding specificity. Structural studies have established the basis for understanding receptor recognition diversity in CoV, its evolution and the adaptation of this virus family to different hosts. CoV responsible for recent outbreaks have extraordinary potential for cross-species transmission; their RBD bear large platforms specialized in recognition of receptors from different species, which facilitates host-to-host circulation and adaptation to man.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reguera, Juan; Mudgal, Gaurav; Santiago, C\u00E9sar; Casasnovas, Jos\u00E9 M.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/834f268f16aa77c2b85de55125d528b6a110dd9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114462.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214004109; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.10.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214004109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25451063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV responsible","CoV infections","CoV cell entry","folding of CoV RBD","S of diverse CoV","attachment of CoV particles","host transmission","cell surface receptor molecules","receptor recognition diversity","host circulation","host cells","receptor complex structures","cell entry receptors","Receptor-binding domains","distinct receptor recognition modes","recognition of receptors","various cell surface molecules","different species","adaptation","cross-species transmission","key determinants","multifunctional glycoprotein","antigenic determinants","different hosts","binding specificity","crystal structures","extraordinary potential","common features","recent outbreaks","large platforms","basis","evolution","date","envelope spike","virus family","membrane penetration","antibodies","coronavirus","man","Structural studies","fusion","Abstract","ectoenzymes"],"language":"en"},

To allow optimal translation of viral proteins at the expense of cellular proteins, virus families have evolved a variety of methods to repress the host translation machinery, while allowing effective viral protein synthesis. Many viruses use noncanonical mechanisms that permit translation of their own RNAs under these conditions. Viruses have also developed mechanisms to evade host innate immune responses that would repress translation under conditions of viral infection, in particular PKR activation in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Importantly, the study of viral translation mechanisms has enormously enhanced our understanding of many aspects of the cellular protein biosynthesis pathway and its components. A number of unusual mechanisms of translation initiation that were first discovered in viruses have since been observed in cellular mRNAs, and it has become apparent that a diverse range of translation mechanisms operates in eukaryotes, allowing subtle regulation of this essential process.","publish_time":"2009-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roberts, Lisa O.; Jopling, Catherine L.; Jackson, Richard J.; Willis, Anne E.","journal":"Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bc61683ff579d2b4627279207af0882d334d810.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102724.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877117309900096; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1877-1173(09)90009-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20374746/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877117309900096","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of viral translation mechanisms","host translation machinery","optimal translation of viral proteins","Viruses","diverse range of translation mechanisms","number of unusual mechanisms of translation initiation","noncanonical mechanisms","conditions of viral infection","protein biosynthesis machinery","effective viral protein synthesis","expense of cellular proteins","cellular protein biosynthesis pathway","cellular mRNAs","host cell","virus families","particular PKR activation","double-stranded RNA","aspects","eukaryotes","subtle regulation","variety of methods","immune responses","components","understanding","essential process","dsRNA"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The cluster involved four generations, each of which was transmitted to the next generation during the incubation period. The time was 2\u20137 days, 6\u20137days, 3\u20138 days and 9 days prior to onset. As of March 11, the fourth-generation cases had no symptoms.

Two cases in this cluster were tested positive again during isolation and observation after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: We determined incubation period was infectious, and confirmed that it was contagious 9 days before the onset.

Progresses in these areas will be helpful to vaccine design and antiviral drugs discovery. Mass spectrometry based proteomics have shown exceptional display of capabilities, not only precisely identifying viral and cellular proteins that are functionally, structurally, and dynamically changed upon virus infection, but also enabling us to detect important pathway proteins. In addition, many isolation and purification techniques and quantitative strategies in conjunction with MS can significantly improve the sensitivity of mass spectrometry for detecting low-abundant proteins, replenishing the stock of virus proteome and enlarging the protein\u2013protein interaction maps. Nevertheless, only a small proportion of the infectious viruses in both of animal and plant have been studied using this approach. As more virus and host genomes are being sequenced, MS-based proteomics is becoming an indispensable tool for virology.

OBJECTIVE: compare clinical presentation and severity between single virus infection and viral coinfection in children admitted for LRTI. METHODS: A 3-year period observational study (2012-2015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. RESULTS: The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85,5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35,5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission. These patients did not have more complementary exams performed but were prescribed medications more often. Viral coinfection group did not show longer length of hospital stay and oxygen need, more need for ICU nor ventilatory support. DISCUSSION: Our study showed a significant proportion of viral coinfections in young infants admitted with LRTI and confirmed previous data showing that prescription was more frequent in inpatients with viral coinfections, without an association with worst clinical outcome.","publish_time":"2017-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gil, Joana; Almeida, Sofia; Constant, Carolina; Pinto, Sara; Barreto, Ros\u00E1rio; Cristino, Jos\u00E9 Melo; Machado, Maria do C\u00E9u; Bandeira, Teresa","journal":"An Pediatr (Barc)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e0e5fd5b8c43beda58abcd5bd1942a4ffd52367.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28571896/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2017.03.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","RSV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relevance of viral coinfections","Viral identification","significant proportion of viral coinfections","unknown viral agents","Viral coinfection group","LRTI","identified virus","single virus infection","Clinical data","clinical presentation","frequent diagnosis","previous data","worst clinical outcome","oxygen need","molecular diagnosis","year period observational study","children younger","longer length of hospital","previous recurrent wheezing","causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections","severity","day-care centers","young infants","ICU","standard collection form","bronchiolitis","pneumonia","association","complementary exams","PCR technique","prescription","health resources","inpatients","prescribed medications","INTRODUCTION","Advances","ventilatory support","OBJECTIVE","HRV","years","samples","frequency","METHODS","viruses","RESULTS","DISCUSSION","admission","RSV"],"language":"en"},

Birds were monitored for clinical and pathological outcomes and virus shedding for 10days post infection (DPI). Clinical signs were limited to the respiratory tract in all challenged groups and varied from mild to moderate mouth breathing to severe respiratory signs with snorting sound and extended head. Mortalities were only recorded in mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge group. AIV-H9N2 challenge caused tracheal petechial hemorrhage that progressed to tracheal congestion and caseation. In mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV vaccine challenge, severe tracheitis with bronchial cast formation was observed. In mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge severe congestion of the tracheal mucosa and excessive exudates with a tendency to form tubular casts were observed. Kidney ureate deposition was only observed in variant IBV challenge group. Histopathologically, tracheal congestion, severe degeneration, and deciliation were noticed in all groups of mixed infection. Interestingly, hemorrhage and atrophy were observed in thymus gland of birds challenged with single AIV-H9N2 or mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV. There was no difference in the tracheal shedding level of variant IBV between single and mixed infected groups while classical IBV shedding increased in mixed infection group. Interestingly, the AIV-H9N2 showed constantly high shedding titers till 7DPI with variant or vaccine IBV co-infection. In conclusion, co-infection of IBV and AIV-H9N2 induced severe clinical outcome and high mortality. Also, IBV co-infection increased the shedding of AIV-H9N2 in experimentally infected birds.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassan, Kareem E.; Ali, Ahmed; Shany, Salama A.S.; El-Kady, Magdy F.","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5bae5ea3b7e58b3ecccbda5316183868b8773e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172277.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881730022X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452881730022X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.06.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mixed AIV-H9N2","AIV-H9N2 challenge","single AIV-H9N2","shedding of AIV","co-infection of IBV","IBV vaccine challenge","variant IBV challenge group","classical IBV shedding","variant IBV challenge severe congestion","vaccine IBV co-infection","tracheal shedding level of variant IBV","vaccine strains of IBV","groups of mixed infection","mixed infection group","mixed infected groups","tracheal congestion","severe tracheitis","severe degeneration","severe respiratory signs","severe clinical outcome","tracheal mucosa","infected birds","tracheal petechial hemorrhage","high shedding titers","days post infection","Clinical signs","challenged groups","thymus gland of birds","respiratory tract","high mortality","virus","snorting sound","moderate mouth","tendency","excessive exudates","bronchial cast formation","extended head","commercial broilers","pathological outcomes","deciliation","Histopathologically","Abstract","study","atrophy","Kidney ureate deposition","difference","conclusion","tubular casts","caseation","Mortalities"],"language":"en"},

Currently, the vaccines for it are only partially effective and no specific drug is available for treatment of TGE virus (TGEV) infection. RNA interference has been confirmed as a new approach for controlling viral infections. In this study, the inhibitory effect of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the ORF 7 gene of TGEV on virus replication was examined. RESULTS: Four theoretically effective sequences of TGEV ORF 7 gene were designed and selected for construction of shRNA expression plasmids. In the reporter assays, three of four shRNA expression plasmids were able to inhibit significantly the expression of ORF 7 gene and replication of TGEV, as shown by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of viral ORF 7 and N genes and detection of virus titers (TCID(50)/ml). Stable swine testicular (ST) cells expressing the shRNAs were established. Observation of the cytopathic effect and apoptosis, as well as a cell proliferation assay demonstrated that the three shRNAs were capable of protecting ST cells against TGEV destruction, with high specificity and efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that plasmid-transcribed shRNAs targeting the ORF 7 gene in the TGEV genome effectively inhibited expression of the viral target gene and viral replication in vitro. These findings provide evidence that the shRNAs have potential therapeutic application for treatment of TGE.","publish_time":"2012-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Lei; Zhang, Yan-ming; Dong, Ling-juan; Cheng, Min; Wang, Jing; Tang, Qing-hai; Wang, Gang","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9c39fa24056184c67ec47da4da93ba583c36e84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3492083.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22929207/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","TGEV","TGEV ORF","TCID","ST","TGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene of TGEV","expression of ORF","replication of TGEV","viral replication","viral target gene","TGEV destruction","effective sequences of TGEV ORF","TGEV genome","viral infections","virus replication","treatment of TGE virus","inhibited expression","plasmid-transcribed shRNAs","contagious viral disease of swine","construction of shRNA expression plasmids","real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of viral ORF","ST cells","RESULTS","detection of virus titers","high specificity","cytopathic effect","high mortality","Stable swine testicular","inhibitory effect of short hairpin RNAs","N genes","potential therapeutic application","severe vomiting","specific drug","apoptosis","diarrhea","evidence","new approach","Observation","study","efficiency","cell proliferation assay","BACKGROUND","Transmissible gastroenteritis","TCID","reporter assays","CONCLUSIONS","findings","RNA interference","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Current recommendations regarding the use of beta-lactams in combination with macrolides published in clinical practice guidelines are variable and based on low-quality evidence that is frequently retrospective, observational, and heterogeneous in nature. While population-based studies have historically suggested improved clinical outcomes with the routine use of macrolide combination therapy in hospitalized patients with CAP, emerging evidence from recent randomized controlled trials has challenged this practice. In this article, we discuss the historical rationale and current evidence for combination macrolide therapy in the management of CAP. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent randomized controlled trials have assessed the non-inferiority of beta-lactam monotherapy compared to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy in adult patients hospitalized with CAP. Beta-lactam monotherapy was associated with equivalent clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate CAP. Patients with severe CAP managed with beta-lactam monotherapy have demonstrated worse clinical outcomes when compared to patients treated with combination therapy. In addition, previous beta-lactam exposure prior to hospitalization has not been shown to negatively impact outcomes in patients managed with beta-lactam monotherapy in the hospital. SUMMARY: Current evidence supports the use of beta-lactam monotherapy in adult patients hospitalized with mild to moderate CAP. While existing evidence supports the use of combination therapy in patients with severe pneumonia, further large-scale randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to clarify the role of combination therapy in this population.","publish_time":"2018-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shumilak, Geoffrey; Sligl, Wendy I.","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089362.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-018-0651-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30191333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Beta-lactam monotherapy","use of beta","use of combination therapy","hospitalized patients","combination macrolide therapy","adult patients","role of combination therapy","previous beta-lactam exposure","routine use of macrolide combination therapy","current evidence","non-inferiority of beta","recent randomized controlled trials","emerging evidence","existing evidence","low-quality evidence","improved clinical outcomes","equivalent clinical outcomes","worse clinical outcomes","severe CAP","large-scale randomized controlled trials","clinical practice guidelines","severe pneumonia","RECENT FINDINGS","management of","Current recommendations","population-based studies","sepsis management","advances","diagnostic microbiology","community","macrolides","historical rationale","significant cause of morbidity","addition","hospitalization","lactams","mortality","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","SUMMARY","nature","article"],"language":"en"},

In particular, we focused on whether this property is attributable to direct inhibition of reovirus attachment and/or inhibition of viral replication with the aid of time-of-addition (pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post-treatment) experiments. No significant antiviral activity of kuraridin was detected in the pre-treatment assay. In the simultaneous assay, the 50% effective inhibitory concentrations (EC(50)) of kuraridin were 15.3\u2013176.9 \u03BCM against human type 1\u20133 reoviruses (HRV1\u20133) and Korean porcine reovirus (PRV). Kuraridin completely blocked binding of viral sigma 1 protein to sialic acids at concentrations lower than 82.5 \u03BCM in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Moreover, kuraridin inhibited HRV1\u20133 and PRV viral replication with EC(50) values of 14.0\u201362.0 \u03BCM. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis disclosed strong suppression of reovirus RNA synthesis at the late stage (18 h) of virus replication by kuraridin. The viral yields of kuraridin-treated cells were significantly reduced at 24 h post-infection, compared with DMSO-treated cells. Our results collectively suggest that kuraridin inhibits virus adsorption and replication by inhibiting hemagglutination, viral RNA and protein synthesis and virus shedding, supporting its utility as a viable candidate antiviral drug against reoviruses.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Jeong, Jae-Ho; Lee, Seung Woong; Ryu, Young Bae; Jeong, Hyung Jae; Jung, Kyungsook; Lim, Jae Sung; Cho, Kyoung-Oh; Lee, Woo Song; Rho, Mun-Chual; Park, Su-Jin","journal":"J Pharmacol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b5b47da22809b8c85f26dbfe9f4e7444354ed05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172900.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1347861315000869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076959/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphs.2015.04.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1347861315000869","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","PRV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral yields of kuraridin","inhibition of viral replication","anti-reovirus activity of kuraridin","PRV viral replication","kuraridin inhibited HRV1","viral RNA","virus replication","significant antiviral activity of kuraridin","\u03BCM","hemagglutination inhibition assay","simultaneous assay","pre-treatment assay","direct inhibition of reovirus attachment","protein synthesis","strong suppression of reovirus RNA synthesis","blocked binding of viral sigma","virus shedding","Korean porcine reovirus","virus adsorption","post-treatment","simultaneous treatment","reoviruses","h post-infection","DMSO-treated cells","concentrations lower","effective inhibitory concentrations","viable candidate antiviral drug","sialic acids","utility","Quantitative real-time PCR analysis","late stage","addition","aid of time","human type","property","experiments","values","roots of Sophora","study","results"],"language":"en"}]}

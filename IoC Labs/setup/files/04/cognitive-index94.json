Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with drugs that provide cardiovascular stability and are rapidly metabolised could be of benefit for use in rabbits. The aim was to evaluate cardiorespiratory effects of TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam in eight New Zealand White rabbits. Subcutaneous premedication with medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg BW) was followed by IV administration of a mixture of 2.5 \u03BCg/mL sufentanil and 0.45 mg/mL midazolam at a rate of 0.3 mL/kg BW/h for anaesthetic induction. Additionally, intravenous boluses of 0.1 mL of the mixture were administered every 20 s until the righting reflex was lost. Following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained for 60 min with an infusion rate adjusted to supress the pedal withdrawal reflex. Air and oxygen (1:2) were delivered at 3 L/min. Physiological variables were recorded before induction and at predefined time points during and after anaesthesia. RESULTS: Righting and pedal withdrawal reflexes were lost within 3 and 5 min, respectively. Doses of sufentanil and midazolam were 0.48 \u03BCg/kg BW and 0.09 mg/kg BW for induction, and 0.72 \u03BCg/kg BW/h and 0.13 mg/kg BW/h for maintenance. Apnoea occurred in two rabbits. Induction of anaesthesia caused a significant increase in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial CO(2) partial pressure and a decrease in mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate and pH. Mean time from stopping the infusion to endotracheal extubation was 5 min, and to return of the righting reflex 7 min. Anaesthesia was characterized by induction and recovery without excitation, with muscle relaxation, and absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex. CONCLUSIONS: TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression, requiring mechanical ventilation. Further evaluation is needed to establish if the protocol is useful for rabbits undergoing surgery.","publish_time":"2013-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedenqvist, Patricia; Edner, Anna; Fahlman, \u00C5sa; Jensen-Waern, Marianne","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcfa3dbb3fadcb51bd684e07b654328d2bf4e0db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3568725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23351150/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-21","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Induction of anaesthesia","BW","recovery of anaesthesia","sufentanil-midazolam","respiratory rate","smooth induction","infusion rate","anaesthetic induction","righting reflex","Total intravenous anaesthesia","heart rate","\u03BCg","Doses of sufentanil","pedal withdrawal reflexes","high mortality rate","New Zealand White rabbits","mean arterial pressure","Mean time","mixture","cardiorespiratory effects of TIVA","respiratory depression","partial pressure","intravenous boluses","endotracheal extubation","endotracheal intubation","predefined time points","significant increase","decrease","cardiac output","marked hypotension","drugs","absence","muscle relaxation","excitation","RESULTS","cardiovascular stability","mechanical ventilation","medetomidine","protocol","surgery","benefit","administration","CONCLUSIONS","Subcutaneous premedication","aim","cats","Physiological variables","maintenance","BACKGROUND","Air","oxygen","dogs","Apnoea","evaluation"],"language":"en"},

Methods We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with influenza A(H5N1) confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identified. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0\u20137). Times to first dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n = 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality = 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia (\u2265 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81\u20135.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal \u003C 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200\u2013400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. Conclusions Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human influenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fibrinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soepandi, Priyanti Z.; Burhan, Erlina; Mangunnegoro, Hadiarto; Nawas, Arifin; Aditama, Tjandra Yoga; Partakusuma, Lia; Isbaniah, Fathiyah; Ikhsan, Mukhtar; Swidarmoko, Boedi; Sutiyoso, Agung; Malik, Suhud; Benamore, Rachel; Baird, J.

We report the epidemiology of ILIs in children who participated in an influenza vaccine effectiveness study during the 2010 Southern Hemisphere influenza season in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Children aged 0\u00B75\u20133 years were prospectively recruited from child care centres (CCCs). We classified them as fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated according to their receipt of unadjuvanted vaccines containing influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. For 13 weeks commencing 30 July 2010, parents reported when their children developed an ILI (fever \u226537\u00B78\u00B0C/feverishness plus \u22651 respiratory symptom) and collected nose and/or throat swabs for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Health impacts were assessed by telephone interview at enrolment and two weeks after each ILI. RESULTS: There were 124 ILIs reported in 105 of 381 enrolled children. Swabs were taken in 117 ILIs: 175 viruses were identified from 103 swabs. Adeno- and rhinoviruses were most frequently identified; 44% of swabs yielded multiple viruses. No virus was associated with more severe symptoms, although rhinovirus-related ILIs lasted longer. Nose swabs had a higher virus detection rate than throat swabs. Influenza-vaccinated children were 1\u00B76 times (P = 0\u00B7001) more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza ILI. CONCLUSION: Adeno- and rhinoviruses were the most common viruses causing ILI. Swabs taken by parents are an effective method for sample collection. Influenza-like illness was more common in children vaccinated against influenza in this observational study, but prior health-seeking behaviour may have contributed to this difference.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dierig, Alexa; Heron, Leon G; Lambert, Stephen B; Yin, Jiehui Kevin; Leask, Julie; Chow, Maria Yui Kwan; Sloots, Theo P; Nissen, Michael D; Ridda, Iman; Booy, Robert","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bcded9bf20651adee9df9dc56030291f0b881fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4181477.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483149/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12229","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["Influenza-vaccinated children","unvaccinated children","non-influenza ILI","throat swabs","young children","Nose swabs","enrolled children","influenza vaccine effectiveness study","Southern Hemisphere influenza season","common viruses","epidemiology of ILIs","illness","parents","rhinovirus-related ILIs","weeks","rhinoviruses","multiple viruses","Adeno","respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction","higher virus detection rate","observational study","respiratory symptom","prior health","Health impacts","PCR","high annual morbidity","telephone interview","Sydney","receipt of unadjuvanted vaccines","effective method","severe symptoms","testing","feverishness","H1N1","Australia","enrolment","times","child care centres","sample collection","CCCs","behaviour","years","CONCLUSION","pdm09","BACKGROUND","difference","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We propose a compartmental model by including a new compartment of the intensity of the media reports, which extends existing models by considering a novel media function, which is dependent both on the number of infected individuals and on the intensity of mass media. The existence and stability of the equilibria are analyzed and an optimal control problem of minimizing the total number of cases and total cost is considered, using reduction or enhancement in the media reporting rate as the control. With the help of Pontryagin\u2019s Maximum Principle, we obtain the optimal media reporting intensity. Through parameterization of the model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the 8th Hospital of Xi\u2019an in Shaanxi Province of China, we obtain the basic reproduction number for the formulated model with two particular media functions. The optimal media reporting intensity obtained here indicates that during the early stage of an epidemic we should quickly enhance media reporting intensity, and keep it at a maximum level until it can finally weaken when epidemic cases have decreased significantly. Numerical simulations show that media impact reduces the number of cases during an epidemic, but that the number of cases is further mitigated under the optimal reporting intensity. Sensitivity analysis implies that the outbreak severity is more sensitive to the weight \u03B1(1) (weight of media effect sensitive to infected individuals) than weight \u03B1(2) (weight of media effect sensitive to media items).","publish_time":"2019-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Weike; Xiao, Yanni; Heffernan, Jane Marie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10f4664e4d1e58018892a7a2ab1eae868d59f2f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6428274.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897141/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213898","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["media impact","media items","intensity of mass media","optimal media reporting intensity","media reporting rate","Mass media reports","weight of media effect sensitive","novel media function","particular media functions","optimal reporting intensity","total number of cases","epidemic cases","weight \u03B1","number of infected individuals","basic reproduction number","optimal control problem","formulated model","outbreak severity","disease outbreak","compartmental model","total cost","H1N1 influenza outbreak data","maximum level","help of Pontryagin\u2019s Maximum Principle","individual behaviour change","Hospital of Xi\u2019an","existing models","reduction","Shaanxi Province of China","new compartment","equilibria","enhancement","Sensitivity analysis","Numerical simulations","existence","stability","early stage","force of infection","parameterization"],"language":"en"},

On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus over and above that contributed by stress hyperglycemia. Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. Methods We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: \u201CCOVID-19\u201D, \u201CSARS-CoV-2\u201D, \u201Cdiabetes\u201D, \u201Cdiabetes mellitus\u201D, \u201CSARS\u201D, \u201Cinfection\u201D and \u201Cmanagement of diabetes mellitus\u201D with interposition of the Boolean operator \u201CAND\u201D. Results Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with DM contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct \u03B2-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus. Conclusions The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with DM take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pal, Rimesh; Bhadada, Sanjay K.","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa2c01daf3bc750129ccf6ce5829407c647cae3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202837.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301144; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301144?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of diabetes mellitus","treatment of COVID","severity of COVID","people","worsening of dysglycemia","poor prognosis","glucose control","two-way interactions","SARS-CoV","good glycemic control","pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu","cytokine-induced insulin resistance","PubMed","reduced expression of ACE2","direct \u03B2-cell damage","EMBASE","articles","renin-angiotensin","hypokalemia","innate immunity","drugs","leads","extensive literature search","aldosterone system antagonists","necessary precautions","interposition","vicious cycle","turn","Google Scholar databases","Results","ongoing pandemic","corticosteroids","Conclusions","infection","patients","Abstract Background","Boolean operator","lopinavir","ritonavir","Methods","following keywords","stress hyperglycemia","hand"],"language":"en"},

During the preweaning period, calves are susceptible to diarrhea that can lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality. Diarrhea has been related with a decrease of beneficial microbiota and an increase of coliform counts in feces. Prebiotic supplements are believed to decrease diarrhea and positively affect some parameters of the immune system. In calves, these supplements have shown some promising effects on intestinal microbial populations but there is limited information about effects on immunity. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of a prebiotic supplement containing fermentation products of lactic acid bacteria on the mucosal immune system by measuring fecal and salivary IgA and to evaluate calf health and growth performance. In this trial 40 Holstein calves were randomly assigned to receive milk replacer with a prebiotic supplement (20 g/day Prebio Support\u2122; Meiji Feed Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) or the same milk replacer with no prebiotic (control). Fecal and salivary IgA, calf health, plasma IgG, and lymphocyte counts were not affected by treatment. Lactobacilli count in feces was higher (P = 0.05) and Bifidobacteria tended to be higher (P = 0.07) in calves fed prebiotic. Prebiotic supplement increased beneficial bacteria in calves, but did not decrease overall incidence of diarrhea in this trial. Calves in this study were all affected by cryptosporidiosis and some were treated with antibiotics, so it is possible that this limited some of the effects of the prebiotic product. Fecal IgA seemed to be a good measure of mucosal immunity, and more studies are needed to develop methods to measure this type of immunity in calves.","publish_time":"2011-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quezada-Mendoza, V.C.; Heinrichs, A.J.; Jones, C.M.","journal":"Livest Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e9565f46be73148924009804105f82dc6f8fd65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102690.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288870/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.07.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141311002824; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871141311002824","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":["Meiji Feed Co., Ltd.

We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosa, Sandro G.

The 60th anniversary of the local Ambulance Services is a good opportunity to provide an overview of the current trends in prehospital emergency medical care in Shanghai. OBJECTIVES: In this report, the features of Shanghai prehospital emergency medical care are described, as well as the Shanghai model of purely prehospital emergency medical care, including the communications and dispatch system, ambulance depots and ambulances, and prehospital rescue teams. Responses to major incidents including public health emergencies and natural disasters are also discussed, with the intention of highlighting future directions in emergency medical services, as well as the influence of international trends in emergency patient care. DISCUSSION: Although Shanghai has the most advanced dispatch system in China (equipped with a Global Positioning System, Global Information System, and more) and can be expanded quickly in case of mass casualty incidents, there is, as yet, no uniform Emergency Medical Service (EMS) dispatching for the entire city. Nor are there certifications, degrees, or special continuing education programs available for EMS dispatchers. Although there are more and more ambulance depots spread all over Shanghai, the city struggles with inadequate prehospital emergency caregivers, because every ambulance has to be staffed with a qualified Emergency Physician, and there are also recruitment problems for ambulance physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Although faced with many challenges, substantial progress is expected in Shanghai prehospital emergency care.","publish_time":"2012-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gui, Li; Gu, Shen; Lu, Feng; Zhou, Bin; Zhang, Ling","journal":"J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b003a769e3c7bd4735fa2dd6cd75b2f87737902e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126957.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2012.02.067; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467912007810; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467912007810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23047196/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ambulance Services","Global Information System","Emergency Medical Service","EMS"],"locations":["China","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["Shanghai prehospital emergency care","prehospital emergency medical services","features of Shanghai prehospital emergency medical care","emergency patient care","inadequate prehospital emergency caregivers","uniform Emergency Medical Service","Shanghai model","qualified Emergency Physician","public Ambulance Services","ambulance depots","local Ambulance Services","ambulance physicians","prehospital rescue teams","Global Positioning System","Global Information System","advanced dispatch system","EMS dispatchers","current trends","major incidents","city struggles","entire city","public health emergencies","influence of international trends","case of mass casualty incidents","special continuing education programs available","ambulances","communications","degrees","overview","China","good opportunity","future directions","natural disasters","substantial progress","Responses","report","recruitment problems","challenges","certifications","intention","anniversary","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

At present, PCVs are divided into three species, PCV1, PCV2, and PCV3. PCV1 and PCV2 were found in the 1970s and the 1990s, respectively, whereas PCV3 was discovered recently in 2016. PCV1 does not cause diseases in pigs. However, PCV3, similar to PCV2, is reported to be associated with several swine diseases, including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive failure. PCVs are very common in domestic pigs as well as wild boars. However, PCVs have been occasionally isolated from non-porcine animals, including ruminants (such as cattle, goats, wild chamois, and roe deers), rodents (such as NMRI mice, BALB/c mice, Black C57 mice, ICR mice, Mus musculus, and Rattus rattus), canines (such as dogs, minks, foxes, and raccoon dogs), insects (such as flies, mosquitoes, and ticks), and shellfish. Moreover, PCVs are frequently reported in biological products, including human vaccines, animal vaccines, porcine-derived commercial pepsin products, and many cell lines. PCVs are also abundant in the environment, including water samples and air samples. Interestingly, PCV1 and/or PCV2 antibody or antigen has also been detected in sera, stool samples and respiratory swab samples of human, revealing zoonotic potential of PCVs. Thus, PCVs inhabit many types of reservoirs. In this review, we summarize the reservoirs of PCVs, and this information would be helpful in understanding the natural circulating status and possible cross-species transmission of PCVs.","publish_time":"2019-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhai, Shao-Lun; Lu, Shou-Sheng; Wei, Wen-Kang; Lv, Dian-Hong; Wen, Xiao-Hui; Zhai, Qi; Chen, Qin-Ling; Sun, Yan-Wei; Xi, Yun","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42966e386536e2e45a30988e43e762c81e7ca6dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6763682.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616677/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00319","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMRI","ICR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reservoirs of PCVs","PCV1","zoonotic potential of PCVs","PCV3","possible cross-species transmission of PCVs","c mice","ICR mice","NMRI mice","porcine dermatitis","water samples","stool samples","air samples","Porcine circovirus","PCV2 antibody","Black C57 mice","human vaccines","respiratory swab samples of human","non-porcine animals","Rattus rattus","porcine-derived commercial pepsin products","animal vaccines","biological products","domestic pigs","raccoon dogs","wild boars","swine diseases","types of reservoirs","Mus musculus","natural circulating status","PDNS","nephropathy syndrome","BALB","goats","ruminants","minks","sera","environment","roe deers","smallest known DNA viruses","mammals","insects","cattle","rodents","foxes","canines","reproductive failure","cell lines","ticks","flies","mosquitoes","antigen","information","shellfish","review","present"],"language":"en"},

On the government\u0027s side, social media can provide a conduit for communicating health risk information in an effective and timely fashion, while also engaging citizens in informed decision-making. On the citizen\u0027s side, information communication technology (ICT)-based practices cannot function unless citizens recognize and act on their responsibility to actively engage with government social media platforms. Despite an increasing interest in understanding the adoption of ICT practices and e-government services for health risk communication, there remains a crucial need for a comprehensive framework to explain which factors determine citizen use of digital government resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to increase government accountability for motivating citizens to engage in ICT-based health risk communication, thereby attaining sustainable public health practices through collaborative governance. By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), this research examines factors that influence citizens\u0027 likelihood of using government social media resources. Survey data from 700 Korean citizens were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to (a) seek risk information through social media and (b) perceive the government\u0027s social media sites as easy to use. Consistent with the GAM, intentions to use the government\u0027s social media sites for information and interactions appear to increase as citizens perceive more value in using them regarding information quality, ease of use, functional benefit, and security. Furthermore, perceived trust in the government\u0027s social media resources appears to function as a mediator of this process. Initial trust in the government is an important determinant of perceptions of its digital resources. Citizens who trust the government tend to evaluate new initiatives positively and are more likely to accept and make use of them. The results of this study can inform policy design and implementation by elucidating the mechanisms that determine citizens\u0027 adoption and usage of digital government services. Theoretically, this work expands the GAM to include health risk communication and adds empirical evidence to the small yet growing body of knowledge of e-government initiatives. These findings also highlight the importance of public trust in the government, as this encourages citizens to seek health risk information and assistance from the government. Overall, the data and model generated in this investigation represent an important step toward the successful and sustainable modernization of public services.","publish_time":"2019-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Taejun (David); Park, Hyojung; Lee, Junesoo","journal":"Gov Inf Q","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/340dfd53fcc624ce7c200694b406cd40b92761ba.json; document_parses/pdf_json/18e5644f3bbb2a2583a7eeb8e43fae84c8593cad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125608.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X18301382; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740624X18301382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288166/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2018.12.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["government social media resources","government social media platforms","health risk information","government accountability","e-government services","e-government initiatives","government\u0027s social media resources","government\u0027s social media sites","e-government adoption model","citizen use of digital government resources","usage of digital government services","ICT-based health risk communication","sustainable public health practices","higher social media competency","Korean citizens","motivating citizens","sustainability of public health practices","information communication technology","information quality","digital resources","adoption of ICT practices","importance of public trust","based practices","GAM","perceived trust","ease of use","Initial trust","sustainable modernization of public services","citizens\u0027 adoption","factors","study","results","citizens\u0027 likelihood","important step","new initiatives","Survey data","important determinant of perceptions","empirical evidence","growing body of knowledge","collaboration","mechanisms","research","individuals","collaborative governance","intentions","interactions","comprehensive framework","conduit","functional benefit","crucial need","timely fashion","implementation","policy design","investigation","responsibility","structural equation modeling","assistance","security","citizen\u0027s","value","mediator","findings","informed decision-making","process","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Our objectives were to determine the frequency of ARI due to respiratory viruses and the associated clinical outcomes during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women in their second or third trimester were enrolled if they reported having symptoms of ARI or were healthy within the preceding 2 weeks. Nasopharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory viruses by molecular diagnostic assays. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at enrollment and via a follow-up telephone-based questionnaire 2 weeks later. RESULTS: There were 155 pregnant participants, with 81 ARI cases and 91 healthy controls. Acute lower respiratory tract illness (ALRTI) was identified in 29 cases (36%). Human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza virus accounted for 75% of virus-positive cases of ALRTI. Cases with ALRTI often reported a longer duration of illness, history of allergies, symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest pain, and use of prescription medication. Two cases with ALRTI reported decreased fetal movement; a third case with ALRTI was hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: In over one third of ARI cases, participants had symptoms consistent with ALRTI. Infection with HRV, RSV, or influenza virus was commonly detected in patients with ALRTI. Viral ALRTI during pregnancy appears to be common and is associated with significant morbidity.","publish_time":"2018-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hause, Anne M; Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Maccato, Maurizio L; Pinell, Phillip M; Bond, Nanette; Santarcangelo, Patricia; Ferlic-Stark, Laura; Munoz, Flor M; Piedra, Pedro A","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4eda0cc78a00f3a2e9e38f03bebb495d214c8f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107407.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29741642/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARI cases","Viral ALRTI","virus-positive cases of ALRTI","symptoms of ARI","respiratory viruses","influenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","frequency of ARI","consequences of viral acute respiratory illness","pregnant participants","pregnant women","Acute lower respiratory tract illness","symptoms of wheezing","symptoms consistent","HRV","RSV","associated clinical outcomes","weeks","pregnancy","longer duration of illness","healthy controls","history of allergies","shortness of breath","decreased fetal movement","chest pain","follow-up telephone-based questionnaire","enrollment","molecular diagnostic assays","Human rhinovirus","Nasopharyngeal secretions","fetuses","patients","prescription medication","significant morbidity","trimester","Infection","METHODS","RESULTS","objectives","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This study estimates the rate of 72-hour ED revisits and identifies its reasons and predictive factors among adults with chronic diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hospital-based retrospective study that included 24,206 ED discharges for adults with chronic diseases at the adult ED of King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh between September 13, 2015 and July 29, 2017 was performed. We extracted data on demographic information, reasons for ED visits/revisits, health insurance coverage, weekend ED arrival, and mortality. RESULTS: A sample of 24,206 ED discharges for 19,697 adults with at least one chronic disease was included in the analysis. The rate of 72-hour revisits in this study population was high: 3,144/24,206 (13%) had the first revisit and 319/3,144 (10.1%) had the second ED revisit within 72 hours. Diseases of the circulatory (19%) and genitourinary (15.8%) systems were the major reasons for the first ED revisit. The adjusted relative rate (aRR) of 72-hour ED revisits was higher in adults with chronic diseases and aged \u226560 years (aRR=1.360, 95% CI: 1.41\u20131.83; P=0.001), patients of female gender (aRR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09\u20131.41; P=0.001), patients with health insurance coverage (aRR=4.23, 95% CI: 2.60\u20136.90; P=0.001), patients arriving to ED on a weekend (aRR=2.13, 95% CI: 1.03\u20134.41; P=0.041), and new patients (aRR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.25\u20131.73; P=0.001). CONCLUSION: The rate of 72-hour revisits is high among adults with chronic diseases. Advancing age, female gender, health insurance coverage, weekend ED arrival, and new patients are the important predictive factors of the high rate of 72-hour revisits. Continuous quality assessment and monitoring of factors related to patients are needed to reduce the frequency of early ED revisits after discharge.","publish_time":"2018-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E; AlBuraikan, Doaa A; Almazroa, Hend R; Alrajhi, Manair N; ALMuqbil, Bashayr I; Albaijan, Monirah A; Alsalamah, Majid A; AL-Jahdali, Hamdan","journal":"Ther Clin Risk Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a68e3a345d7da33f2fcb9456aca1998647cb69e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6098417.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/tcrm.s168763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30147326/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["hour ED revisits","ED discharges","ED visits","hour revisits","weekend ED arrival","frequency of early ED revisits","adults","chronic diseases","new patients","high rate","patients of female gender","adult ED of King Abdulaziz Medical City","health insurance coverage","adjusted relative rate","important predictive factors","monitoring of factors","major reasons","retrospective study","study population","adult emergency department","utilization","increase","demographic information","years","Saudi Arabia","Riyadh","Continuous quality assessment","studies","hospital","systems","data","METHODS","sample","mortality","BACKGROUND","analysis","RESULTS","hours","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

To identify the regions recognized by MAbs, DNA fragments derived from the N-coding region of the TGEV strain FS772/70 were cloned into pUR expression plasmids and the antigenicity of the resulting fusion proteins was analyzed by immunobloting. A major antigenic domain was identified, covering the first 241 amino acid residues of N, within which an epitope (residues 57\u2013117) was also found. A second antigenic domain extended from residues 175 to 360 of the nucleoprotein, within which a subsite was characterized within the region covering residues 241\u2013349. MAb DA3 recognized a linear epitope which mapped within residues 360 and 382 at the carboxy terminus of the nucleoprotein. The binding of the majority of the MAbs (8 out of 11) to large fusions, but not to smaller fragments included in them, suggests a conformational dependence of the MAb binding sites.

We focus on applying CATCH to capture viral genomes in complex metagenomic samples. We design, synthesize, and validate multiple probe sets, including one that targets whole genomes of the 356 viral species known to infect humans. Capture with these probe sets enriches unique viral content on average 18-fold, allowing us to assemble genomes that could not be recovered without enrichment, and accurately preserves within-sample diversity. We also use these probe sets to recover genomes from the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria and to improve detection of uncharacterized viral infections in human and mosquito samples. The results demonstrate that CATCH enables more sensitive and cost-effective metagenomic sequencing.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metsky, Hayden C.; Siddle, Katherine J.; Gladden-Young, Adrianne; Qu, James; Yang, David K.; Brehio, Patrick; Goldfarb, Andrew; Piantadosi, Anne; Wohl, Shirlee; Carter, Amber; Lin, Aaron E.; Barnes, Kayla G.; Tully, Damien C.; Corleis, Bj\u04E7rn; Hennigan, Scott; Barbosa-Lima, Giselle; Vieira, Yasmine R.; Paul, Lauren M.; Tan, Amanda L.; Garcia, Kimberly F.; Parham, Leda A.; Odia, Ikponmwosa; Eromon, Philomena; Folarin, Onikepe A.; Goba, Augustine; Simon-Lori\u00E8re, Etienne; Hensley, Lisa; Balmaseda, Angel; Harris, Eva; Kwon, Douglas S.; Allen, Todd M.; Runstadler, Jonathan A.; Smole, Sandra; Bozza, Fernando A.; Souza, Thiago M.

However, cryo-EM tomography of DENV replication complexes showed that DENV replicates on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae invaginations and not on classical autophagosomes. Recently, it was reported that autophagy plays an indirect role in DENV replication by modulating cellular lipid metabolism. DENV-induced autophagosomes deplete cellular triglycerides that are stored in lipid droplets, leading to increased \u03B2-oxidation and energy production. This is the first example of a virus triggering autophagy to modulate cellular physiology.

All animals\u2014from fish to mammals\u2014have demonstrable APP, but the type of major APP differs by species. While the primary application of these proteins in a clinical setting is prognostication, studies in animals have demonstrated relevance to diagnosis and detection and monitoring for subclinical disease.

Commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used for serological monitoring. The serosurvey revealed seroprevalence rates of 64.28%, 11.26%, 7.87%, 7.84%, 3.82% and 1.59% for PPV, ADV, PRCV, SIV, PRRSV and TGEV, respectively. The seroprevalence rates differed between populations and age classes with the highest number of antibody-positive wild boars in older animals (\u003E1 year old). No antibodies to TGEV were found in Baden\u2013Wuerttemberg and in Mecklenburg\u2013Western Pomerania (investigation period 1997/1998). In addition, sera collected in Mecklenburg\u2013Western Pomerania in 1997/1998 were negative for SIV. Even though the seroprevalence rates established for these viruses, except for PPV, were relatively low, wild boars may act as a reservoir for pathogens and a source of infection for domestic pigs and humans. Based on the epidemiological situation, no risk of a spread of these viruses should emanate from wild boars, neither for wildlife nor for livestock. However, effective and science-based disease monitoring programmes should continuously be carried out in wild boar populations.","publish_time":"2008-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaden, V.; Lange, E.; H\u00E4nel, A.; Hlinak, A.; Mewes, L.; Hergarten, G.; Irsch, B.; Dedek, J.; Bruer, W.","journal":"Eur","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e93ca969785c22be69d1fd4aaed2336d7f7e4580.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088096.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214937/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-008-0229-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive wild boars","SIV","TGEV","PPV","seroprevalence rates","selected wild boar populations","respiratory syndrome virus","Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus","swine influenza virus","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","porcine respiratory coronavirus","PRRSV","PRCV","Mecklenburg","ADV","Western Pomerania","viruses","occurrence of porcine parvovirus","science-based disease monitoring programmes","serological monitoring","highest number of antibody","hemagglutination inhibition tests","older animals","immunosorbent assay","age classes","source of infection","Wuerttemberg","Germany","Commercial enzyme","domestic pigs","risk","Baden","sera","investigation period","reservoir","humans","pathogens","year old","spread","wildlife","epidemiological situation","study","addition","antibodies","serosurvey","objective","livestock"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled children aged 2\u201359 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods. RESULTS: From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral detection in upper respiratory secretions was common, with at least one virus detected in 103/115 (89.6%). The three most-commonly isolated viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (52/115; 45.2%), rhinovirus (42/115; 36.5%), and human parainfluenza virus (19/115; 16.5%). A third of patients with viral infections showed mixed infections. Case fatality rate was 3.2% (6/189).

Information on the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV is limited in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in China, especially those of a novel genotype, Ad55. METHODS: In total, 1169 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children younger than 14 years with ARTIs between November 2006 and November 2009. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen HAdVs. All PCR-positive products were sequenced. RESULTS: 74 of 1169 (6.33%) specimens were positive for HAdVs. Among positive cases, AdV3 (58/74) was detected most frequently, followed by AdV11 (10/74), AdV2 (2/74), AdV7 (2/69), AdV6 (1/74), and AdV1 (1/74). AdV55 was found in one case. The incidence of HAdV infection peaked in children aged 3\u20137 years. The most common clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory infection, and the most common syndrome was fever and cough.The comparison of HAdV and RSV group revealed that Children infected with group AdV were significant older than children infected with group RSV, had more fever but less frequently wheezing, and cough, crackles, and cyanosis, The duration of hospitalization between the AdV group and RSV group was not significant, but a greater frequency of LRTIs was observed in RSV group. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV is an important viral agent in children with ARTIs in Lanzhou City, China. Multiple HAdV serotypes co-circulated with Ad3, which was predominant in this 3-year study. The novel AdV55 genotype was found in one case. No fixed seasonal rhythm could be identified.","publish_time":"2013-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Yu; Zhang, Rong-fang; Xie, Zhi-ping; Yan, Kun-long; Gao, Han-chun; Song, Jing-rong; Yuan, Xin-hui; Hou, Yun-de; Duan, Zhao-jun","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/206b5371a11c4b903ed2600b579171a3e6873764.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4015357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23984826/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-271","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","AdV"],"locations":["Lanzhou City","China"],"keyphrases":["RSV group","group RSV","children younger","group AdV","AdV group","comparison of HAdV","incidence of HAdV infection","ARTIs","clinical features of HAdV","upper respiratory infection","important agent","Multiple HAdV serotypes co-circulated","cough","China","fever","novel genotype","PCR-positive products","novel AdV55 genotype","positive cases","years","HAdVs","acute respiratory tract infections","important viral agent","common clinical diagnosis","common syndrome","Ad3","duration of hospitalization","nasopharyngeal aspirates","Lanzhou City","cyanosis","greater frequency of LRTIs","Human adenovirus","total","polymerase chain reaction","crackles","Information","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","AdV2","AdV6","AdV7","fixed seasonal rhythm","year study","METHODS","AdV3","Ad55","specimens","AdV11","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Rather than modulating ER stress in host cells, TUDCA abolished the proton conductivity of viral M2 by disrupting its oligomeric states, which induces inefficient viral infection. We also showed that M2 penetrated cells, whose intracellular uptake depended on its proton channel activity, an effect observed in both TUDCA and M2 inhibitor amantadine.

An accurate root indication, however, strongly depends on the availability of a proper outgroup. An alternate rooting method is the midpoint rooting (MPR). In this case, the root is set at the midpoint between the two most divergent operational taxonomic units. Although the midpoint rooting algorithm has been extensively used, the efficiency of this method in retrieving the correct root remains untested. In the present study, we empirically tested the success rate of the MPR in obtaining the outgroup root for a given phylogenetic tree. This was carried out by eliminating outgroups in 50 selected data sets from 33 papers and rooting the trees with the midpoint method. We were thus able to compare the root position retrieved by each method. Data sets were separated into three categories with different root consistencies: data sets with a single outgroup taxon (54% success rate for MPR), data sets with multiple outgroup taxa that showed inconsistency in root position (82% success rate), and data sets with multiple outgroup taxa in which root position was consistent (94% success rate). Interestingly, the more consistent the outgroup root is, the more successful MPR appears to be. This is a strong indication that the MPR method is valuable, particularly for cases where a proper outgroup is unavailable.","publish_time":"2007-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"HESS, PABLO N.; DE MORAES RUSSO, CLAUDIA A.","journal":"Biol J Linn Soc Lond","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87ef24be249dbbdc71415b157c698d03f79228ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110036.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287391/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00864.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outgroup root","outgroup method","root position","correct root","MPR method","proper outgroup","midpoint method","accurate root indication","multiple outgroup taxa","success rate","different root consistencies","selected data sets","alternate rooting method","single outgroup taxon","successful MPR","midpoint rooting algorithm","phylogenetic trees","strong indication","given phylogenetic tree","categories","cases","inconsistency","papers","divergent operational taxonomic units","outgroups","availability","present study","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

Few policy diffusion studies have examined use of information, such as cost\u2013benefit analyses, in the diffusion process. The purpose of this study is to examine how cost\u2013benefit analyses were used during the rapid diffusion of 2-1-1 across states. The paper also describes components of 2-1-1 cost\u2013benefit analyses. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In 2011, cost\u2013benefit analyses of 2-1-1 and substantive citations of them were identified through scholarly key word searches using Academic Search Premier and Web of Science, general Internet searches using Google search terms, and communications with academicians and 2-1-1 practitioners through personal contact and e-mail discussion groups. To be included in this study, documents had to be related to 2-1-1 helplines, present information about their costs and benefits, and be formal documents. The documents were catalogued and analyzed for cost\u2013benefit analyses or references to analyses, and stated purpose. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of the 19 documents that met eligibility inclusion criteria, nine were original cost\u2013benefit analyses and ten referenced analyses conducted for other jurisdictions. CONCLUSIONS: The diffusion of 2-1-1 helplines in the U.S. has been influenced by interjurisdictional exchange of cost\u2013benefit analyses, in both the creation of original analyses and/or the referencing of previous work.","publish_time":"2012-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shank, Nancy","journal":"Am J Prev Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd64fb446f68ac1f5d9f1856bda7f8012b3564b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135375.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379712006174; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2012.08.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23157771/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379712006174","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["benefit analyses","referenced analyses","original cost","creation of original analyses","interjurisdictional exchange of cost","diffusion process","rapid diffusion","policy diffusion studies","Policy diffusion theory","formal documents","helplines","study","use of information","present information","proposed innovation","stated purpose","EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS","EVIDENCE ACQUISITION","Academic Search Premier","Google search terms","general Internet searches","social services innovation","scholarly key word searches","Web of Science","tools","references","personal contact","costs","benefits","e-mail discussion groups","eligibility inclusion criteria","practitioners","effects","communications","policymakers","academicians","referencing of previous work","uncertainty","jurisdictions","substantive citations","paper","components","CONCLUSIONS","CONTEXT","states"],"language":"en"},

In this report, we characterized anti-viral cytotoxic T cells in the central nervous system and spleen during the acute and chronic stages of the MHV infection. The data show that C57BI/6 mice display a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response to the surface (S) glycoprotein and this response can be demonstrated in lymphocytes isolated from the brains and spinal cords of mice both acutely and persistently infected with MHV-JHM. Thus, the anti-S CTL activity present in the central nervous system of chronically infected animals is not sufficient to prevent the demyelinating process. BALB/c mice have been shown previously to mount a CTL response against the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Stohlman et al., 1992). Since C57BI/6 mice do not mount a response to the N protein, the role of the N-specific response in preventing the late onset disease was assessed using B10.A(18R) mice, recombinant in the H-2 locus. These mice contain the d alleles of the D and L loci and exhibit a CTL response against the N protein. However, unlike the BALB/c mice, these animals develop the late onset symptomatic disease. These results suggest that the N-specific response is partially protective against the development of the demyelinating disease, but that additional factors are also likely to be involved.","publish_time":"1994-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro, Raymond F.; Evans, Gregory D.; Jaszewski, Andrew; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284712372; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284712372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CTL response","c mice","N-specific response","N protein","spinal cords of mice","late onset disease","MHV-JHM","demyelinating disease","BALB","late onset symptomatic disease","infected animals","central nervous system","anti-S CTL activity present","symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis","MHV infection","demyelinating process","Abstract C57BI","anti-viral cytotoxic T cells","d alleles","mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM","spleen","chronic stages","nucleocapsid","role","recombinant","brains","additional factors","B10","loci","surface","development","report","lymphocytes","glycoprotein","Stohlman","locus","results","data"],"language":"en"},

Early events are considered to be a determinant of infection outcome. To investigate the dog\u0027s early immune response to L. chagasi, an in vitro priming system (PIV) using dog na\u00EFve PBMC was established. Until now, dog PIV immune response to L. chagasi has not been assessed. We co-cultivated PBMC primarily stimulated with L. chagasi in vitro with autologous infected macrophages and found that IFN-\u03B3 mRNA is up-regulated in these cells compared to control unstimulated cells. IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA expression by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC was similar to control unstimulated PBMC when incubated with infected macrophages. Surprisingly, correlation studies showed that a lower IFN-\u03B3/IL-4 expression ratio correlated with a lower percentage of infection. We propose that the direct correlation between IFN-\u03B3/IL-4 ratio and parasite load is dependent on the higher correlation of both IFN-\u03B3 and IL-4 expression with lower parasite infection. This PIV system was shown to be useful in evaluating the dog immune response to L. chagasi, and results indicate that a balance between IFN-\u03B3 and IL-4 is associated with control of parasite infection in vitro.","publish_time":"2009-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodrigues, Cleusa Alves Theodoro; Batista, Lu\u00EDs F\u00E1bio da Silva; Filho, Roberto Santos Teixeira; Santos, Claire da Silva; Pinheiro, Cristiane Garboggini; Almeida, Ta\u00EDs Fontoura de; Freitas, Luiz Ant\u00F4nio Rodrigues de; Veras, Patr\u00EDcia Sampaio Tavares","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/580ef6221be447d69d40ee06d635a3d44227a150.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126995.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19054575/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242708007149; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242708007149; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.10.324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IL","lower IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B3 mRNA","dog immune response","dog PIV immune response","chagasi-stimulated PBMC","lower parasite infection","control of parasite infection","canine immune response","control unstimulated PBMC","dog\u0027s early immune response","dog na\u00EFve PBMC","lower percentage of infection","expression ratio","mRNA expression","parasite load","PIV system","control unstimulated cells","higher correlation","co-cultivated PBMC","correlation studies","direct correlation","determinant of infection outcome","autologous infected macrophages","priming system","Early events","results","balance","Leishmania","exposure","mice","humans"],"language":"en"},

Here we reviewed the characters and functions of macrophage polarization in infection, atherosclerosis, obesity, tumor, asthma, and sepsis, and proposed that targeting macrophage polarization and skewing their phenotype to adapt to the microenvironment might hold great promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yan-Cun; Zou, Xian-Biao; Chai, Yan-Fen; Yao, Yong-Ming","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cae1f2fd5785845caa42d6497361eba46a68f11d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4046879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910531/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.8879","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activated macrophages","M2 macrophages","hallmarks of macrophages","M1 macrophages","Transformation of different phenotypes of macrophages","infection","functions of macrophage polarization","treatment of inflammatory diseases","cessation of inflammatory diseases","spectrum of macrophage activation","central role","responses","atherosclerosis","host defense","tumor","obesity","initiation","development","tissue remodeling","great promise","anti-inflammatory reactions","asthma","microenvironment","terminals","sepsis","plasticity"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later. INTERPRETATION: Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19.

Hence we can predict not only whether a putative enzyme in a newly sequenced organism has the potential to perform a certain reaction, but how the reaction is performed, using which cofactors and with susceptibility to which drugs or inhibitors, details with important consequences for drug and enzyme design. Work that predicts enzyme catalytic activity based on 3D protein structure features limits the prediction of mechanism to proteins already having either a solved structure or a close relative suitable for homology modelling. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluate whether sequence identity, InterPro or Catalytic Site Atlas sequence signatures provide enough information for bulk prediction of enzyme mechanism. By splitting MACiE (Mechanism, Annotation and Classification in Enzymes database) mechanism labels to a finer granularity, which includes the role of the protein chain in the overall enzyme complex, the method can predict at 96% accuracy (and 96% micro-averaged precision, 99.9% macro-averaged recall) the MACiE mechanism definitions of 248 proteins available in the MACiE, EzCatDb (Database of Enzyme Catalytic Mechanisms) and SFLD (Structure Function Linkage Database) databases using an off-the-shelf K-Nearest Neighbours multi-label algorithm. CONCLUSION: We find that InterPro signatures are critical for accurate prediction of enzyme mechanism. We also find that incorporating Catalytic Site Atlas attributes does not seem to provide additional accuracy.

At the time of writing, COVID-19 in Wuhan appears to be in the final phase and under control. However, many other countries, especially the US, Italy and Spain, are still in the early phases and dealing with increasing cases every day. Therefore, this article aims to summarise and share the experience of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and provide effective suggestions to enable other countries to save lives. Study Design Data from the National Health Commission of China is used to investigate the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan and discuss the impacts of the intervention strategies. Methods A four-stage modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is presented. This model considers many influencing factors, including chunyun (the Spring festival), sealing off the city and constructing the Fang Cang shelter hospitals. In addition, a novel method is proposed to address the abnormal data on 12-13 February as a result of changing diagnostic criteria. Four different scenarios are considered to capture different intervention measures in practice. The exposed population in Wuhan who moved out prior to sealing off the city have also been identified and an analysis on where they had gone was performed using the Baidu migration index. Results The results demonstrate that the four-stage model was effective in forecasting the peak, size and duration of COVID-19. We found that the combined intervention measures are the only effective way to control the spread and not a single one of them can be omitted. We estimate that England will be another epicentre due to its incorrect response at the initial stages of COVID-19. Fortunately, big data technology can help provide early warnings to new areas of the pandemic. Conclusions The four-stage SEIR model was effective in capturing the evolution trajectory of COVID-19. Based on the model analysis, several effective suggestions are proposed to prevent and control the pandemic for countries that are still in the initial phases.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ming; Ning, Jing; Du, Yurui; Cao, Jie; Zhang, Ding; Wang, Jiangang; Chen, Mingjun","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf5fb56d630223877d99441bbe7a04b34336f0c1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620301542?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620301542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442842/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Design Data","Fang Cang","Baidu"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","England"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","stage model","duration of COVID","Wuhan city","evolution trajectory of COVID","effective suggestions","model analysis","initial stages of COVID","stage SEIR model","effective way","countries","control","different intervention measures","early phases","combined intervention measures","abnormal data","intervention strategies","initial phases","global pandemic","results","Study Design Data","big data technology","early warnings","different scenarios","novel method","exposed population","novel coronavirus disease","National Health Commission of China","peak","incorrect response","chunyun","increasing cases","new areas","size","Fang Cang shelter hospitals","influencing factors","epicentre","Spring festival","Spain","Italy","practice","impacts","Conclusions","final phase","time of writing","diagnostic criteria","Baidu migration index","day","addition","Methods","experience","Abstract Objectives","England","lives","article"],"language":"en"},

ZIKV can persist in testis and semen for a long time, causing testicular tissue damage and reducing sperm quality. However, no drug has been approved for prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection, especially infection in male testicular tissue. Previously reported peptide Z2 could inactivate ZIKV, inhibiting ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, Z2 could inhibit vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice, reducing ZIKV infection in fetus. Here we showed that intraperitoneally administered Z2 could also be distributed to testis and epididymis, resulting in the reduction of ZIKV RNA copies in testicular tissue and protection of testis and epididymis against ZIKV-induced pathological damage and poor sperm quality in type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. Thus, Z2, a ZIKV inactivator, could serve as an antiviral agent for treatment of ZIKV infection and attenuation of ZIKV-induced testicular tissue damage.","publish_time":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Si, Lulu; Meng, Yu; Tian, Fang; Li, Weihua; Zou, Peng; Wang, Qian; Xu, Wei; Wang, Yuzhu; Xia, Minjie; Hu, Jingying; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4813a9f4fee2d74c954d90bed67e8738047a390.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6777420.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611865/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuation of ZIKV","ZIKV inactivator","treatment of ZIKV infection","vertical transmission of ZIKV","reduction of ZIKV RNA copies","testicular tissue damage","male testicular tissue","administered Z2","reported peptide Z2","pathological damage","protection of testis","fetus","epididymis","congenital Zika syndrome","poor sperm quality","Barr\u00E9 Syndrome","pregnant mice","Zika virus","sexual transmission cases","interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice","type","adult","long time","Guillain","re-emerging arbovirus","mosquito bites","antiviral agent","infant","semen","prevention","outbreak","drug"],"language":"en"},

We present a relatively generic statistical model for the estimation of transmission risk factors, and discuss algorithms to estimate its parameters for different levels of missing data. We look at the problem of computational times for relatively large datasets and show how they can be reduced by appropriate use of discretization, sufficient statistics and some simple assumptions on the natural history of the disease.

Recently, it has been shown that cationic amphiphiles, among them the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone, inhibit filovirus infection. In the present work, we investigated how amiodarone interferes with Ebola virus infection. Wild-type Sudan ebolavirus and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, pseudotyped with the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, were used to gain further insight into the ability of amiodarone to affect Ebola virus infection. We show that amiodarone decreases Ebola virus infection at concentrations close to those found in the sera of patients treated for arrhythmias. The drug acts by interfering with the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. We also show that MDEA, the main amiodarone metabolite, contributes to the antiviral activity. Finally, studies with amiodarone analogues indicate that the antiviral activity is correlated with drug ability to accumulate into and interfere with the endocytic pathway. Considering that it is well tolerated, especially in the acute setting, amiodarone appears to deserve consideration for clinical use in EVD.","publish_time":"2015-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salata, Cristiano; Baritussio, Aldo; Munegato, Denis; Calistri, Arianna; Ha, Huy Riem; Bigler, Laurent; Fabris, Fabrizio; Parolin, Cristina; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio; Mirazimi, Ali","journal":"Pathog Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de2fd30c73d5eb86c9202a40bacf96169559f031.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108539.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25933611/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femspd/ftv032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Zaire"],"keyphrases":["ability of amiodarone","Ebola virus infection","amiodarone analogues","antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone","Ebola virus disease","main amiodarone metabolite","filovirus infection","drug ability","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","antiviral activity","drug acts","EVD","Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein","Wild-type Sudan ebolavirus","high fatality rate","consideration","viral envelope","lethal transmissible infections","fusion","concentrations","clinical use","endosomal membrane","treatment","MDEA","cationic amphiphiles","acute setting","sera of patients","arrhythmias","present work","studies","insight","endocytic pathway"],"language":"en"},

To address the function of myeloid CD13 directly, we created a CD13 null mouse and assessed the responses of purified primary macrophages or DCs from WT and CD13 null animals in cell assays and inflammatory disease models, where CD13 has been implicated previously. We find that mice lacking CD13 develop normally with normal hematopoietic profiles except for an increase in thymic but not peripheral T cell numbers. Moreover, in in vitro assays, CD13 appears to be largely dispensable for the aspects of phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen presentation that we tested, although we observed a slight decrease in actin-independent erythrocyte uptake. However, in agreement with our published studies, we show that lack of monocytic CD13 completely ablates anti-CD13-dependent monocyte adhesion to WT endothelial cells. In vivo assessment of four inflammatory disease models showed that lack of CD13 has little effect on disease onset or progression.

Sixty-two of 443 samples were positive for HPIVs with 4 positive for HPIV-2 and 58 positive for HPIV-3, indicating that HPIV-3 was the predominant virus present during the study period. A phylogenetic tree based on all the available HN (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) sequences of HPIV-3 indicated that three distinct clusters (A,B, and C) were circulating with some temporal and regional clustering. Cluster C was further divided into sub-clusters, C1, C2, C3 and C4. HPIV-3 from Beijing isolates belonged to sub-cluster C3, and were grouped with the isolates from two Provinces of China and the neighboring country of Japan. Genetic analysis based on entire HN gene revealed that the HPIV-3 isolates from Beijing were highly similar with 97.2%\u2013100% identity at the nucleotide level and these could be divided into two closely related lineages, C3a and C3b.

Thousands of emergency operations were carried out in the interim. However no one focused on the clinical symptom of emergency surgery patients (ESP) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 164 ESP with or without COVID-19 pneumonia in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 5, 2020. The associated clinical, laboratory, epidemiological, demographic, radiological and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Results Of 164 ESP, the median age was 41 years old (interquartile range (IQR), 29-89) and 136 (82.9%) were women.

Previous studies described significant variations in acute asthma management in children. This study was conducted to examine whether asthma management in the pediatric emergency department (ED) was improved through the use of an evidence-based acute asthma care guideline reminder card. Methods The Pediatric Acute Asthma Management Guideline (PAMG) was introduced to the ED of a pediatric tertiary care hospital in Ontario, Canada. Medical charts of 278 retrospective ED visits (January\u2013December 2002) and 154 prospective visits (July 2003\u2013June 2004) were reviewed to assess changes in acute asthma management such as medication treatment, asthma education, and discharge planning. Logistic and linear regressions were used to determine the effect of PAMG on asthma management in the ED. The propensity score method was used to adjust for confounding. Results During the implementation of PAMG, patients who visited the ED were more likely to receive oral corticosteroids (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.63\u20133.14, p \u003C 0.0001) and oxygen saturation reassessment before ED discharge (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.45\u20132.82, p \u003C 0.0001). They also received 0.23 (95% CI: 0.03\u20130.44, p = 0.0283) more doses of bronchodilator in the first hour of ED stay. Improvements in asthma education and discharge planning were noted, but the changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions After the implementation of an evidence-based guideline reminder card, medication treatment for acute asthma in the ED was significantly improved; however, asthma education and discharge planning remained unchanged. Future efforts on promoting guideline-based practice in the ED should focus on these components.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, Teresa; Wang, Chengning; Dell, Sharon D.; Fleming-Carroll, Bonnie; Parkin, Patricia; Scolnik, Dennis; Ungar, Wendy J.","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/234da2ad9c3b659a5b7b0896ddba144e37bcb8b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127167.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611110001460; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2010.03.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611110001460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20434896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["PAMG"],"locations":["Ontario","Canada"],"keyphrases":["asthma education","ED discharge","Pediatric Acute Asthma Management Guideline","hour of ED","acute asthma care guideline reminder card","Summary Objective Asthma","retrospective ED visits","discharge planning","CI","guideline-based practice","evidence-based guideline reminder card","implementation of PAMG","medication treatment","AOR","effect of PAMG","children","changes","pediatric tertiary care hospital","pediatric emergency department","significant variations","prospective visits","oral corticosteroids","Adjusted Odds Ratio","oxygen saturation reassessment","Ontario","common chronic disease","Methods","Previous studies","Canada","Medical charts","Improvements","Future efforts","propensity score method","doses of bronchodilator","patients","use","linear regressions","Conclusions","Results","confounding","components","study"],"language":"en"},

It is characterized by acute onset of diarrhea, fever, depression, and reduced milk yield in adult cattle. Although production loss is a well-known consequence of WD, large-scale studies estimating the effect on milk production are lacking. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of farmer-reported WD on herd-level milk production and milk composition. A cohort study was performed based on reports of herd outbreaks of winter dysentery during a regional epidemic in Norway during the winter of 2011\u20132012. Reports were made by farmers, and diagnosis was based on a herd outbreak of acute diarrhea in adults. Milk shipment data were retrieved from the dairy company, and information on herd size and milking system were retrieved from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. We compared milk production in herds with reported outbreaks of WD (n = 224) with all herds in the same area without a reported outbreak (n = 2,093) during the same period. The outcome variable in the analysis was milk volume per cow per day, and the main predictor was whether the herd had a reported outbreak of WD or not. We assessed the effect of WD on milk production by fitting a linear mixed model, adjusting for milk production in the herd before the outbreak. Similarly, we assessed the effect of WD on milk composition using linear regression, adjusting for the levels of milk components before the outbreak. This study estimated a total loss of 51 L/cow during the study period, from 7 d before to 19 d after a reported outbreak. The lowest estimated production was 2 d after the outbreak was reported, when the average milk yield was 19.4 L/cow per day, compared with 23.0 L/cow per day 7 days before notification (i.e., a difference of 3.6 L/cow, or 15%). The effect gradually declined with time. The estimated effect on milk composition was modest, but an increase of 11% in free fatty acids and a small increase in fat/protein ratio indicated that WD might put cows into negative energy balance. Descriptive analysis indicated that herd milk yield was still reduced 4 mo after an outbreak. This cohort study showed that WD causes considerable decreases in milk production, and it alters milk composition. These findings highlight the important negative consequences of WD, and should motivate actions to prevent between-herd spread of bovine coronavirus.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toftaker, Ingrid; Holm\u00F8y, Ingrid; N\u00F8dtvedt, Ane; \u00D8ster\u00E5s, Olav; Stokstad, Maria","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8d46f53f831cf34a17ba343ce441694c76d7133.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094253.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002203021730574X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002203021730574X; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-12605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601443/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WD","Dairy Herd Recording System"],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["milk composition","herd milk yield","herd-level milk production","milk volume","effect of WD","reported outbreak of WD","reduced milk yield","average milk yield","levels of milk components","Milk shipment data","reported outbreaks of WD","herd outbreak of acute diarrhea","herd size","production loss","estimated effect","well-known consequence of WD","lowest estimated production","reports of herd outbreaks of winter dysentery","important negative consequences of WD","effect of farmer","cohort study","study period","Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System","ABSTRACT Winter dysentery","herds","bovine coronavirus","acute onset of diarrhea","small increase","dairy company","milking system","linear regression","Descriptive analysis","total loss","linear mixed model","negative energy balance","large-scale studies","information","fever","depression","protein ratio","regional epidemic","considerable decreases","free fatty acids","cows","contagious disease","Norway","notification","adult cattle","area","adults","outcome variable","main predictor","findings","days","diagnosis","farmers","difference","actions","objective","time"],"language":"en"},

While humans are constantly exposed to animal viruses, those that can successfully infect and transmit between humans are exceedingly rare. The key event in zoonosis is when an animal virus begins to replicate (one virion making many) in the first human subject. Only at this point will the animal virus first experience the selective environment of the human body, rendering possible viral adaptation and refinement for humans. In addition, appreciable viral titers in this first human may enable infection of a second, thus initiating selection for viral variants with increased capacity for spread. We assert that host genetics plays a critical role in defining which animal viruses in nature will achieve this key event of replication in a first human host. This is because animal viruses that pose the greatest risk to humans will have few (or no) genetic barriers to replicating themselves in human cells, thus requiring minimal mutations to make this jump. Only experimental virology provides a path to identifying animal viruses with the potential to replicate themselves in humans because this information will not be evident from viral sequencing data alone.","publish_time":"2019-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warren, Cody J.; Sawyer, Sara L.","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19bbeefa3a126f32fe8339a1fb11e3d9a1c7881c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6474636.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002666/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000217","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal viruses","humans","human host","Viruses of wild","Ebola viruses","human body","human cells","human subject","viral variants","possible viral adaptation","appreciable viral titers","viral sequencing data","zoonosis","key event of replication","host genetics","events","initiating selection","selective environment","critical role","increased capacity","domestic animals","minimal mutations","process","refinement","path","nature","greatest risk","rise","explosive epidemics","addition","information","potential","experimental virology","genetic barriers","jump","infection","HIV","point","virion"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels, with highest numbers in Africa and the Middle East. The hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them, especially as a stable protein source. Camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals. The ability for camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat, lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions, and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species. We conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications (65%) focused on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), brucellosis, Echinococcus granulosus, and Rift Valley fever. The high fatality from MERS outbreaks during 2012\u20132016 elicited an immediate response from the research community as demonstrated by a surge of MERS-related publications. However, we contend that other camel-borne diseases such as Yersinia pestis, Coxiella burnetii, and Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever are just as important to include in surveillance efforts. Camel populations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are increasing exponentially in response to prolonged droughts, and thus, the risk of zoonoses increases as well. In this review, we provide an overview of the major zoonotic diseases present in dromedary camels, their risk to humans, and recommendations to minimize spillover events.","publish_time":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Sophie; Zimmerman, Dawn; Deem, Sharon L.","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d1597cc35e0fe83fdea72914cbc0f80391aebf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087575.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140075/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-019-01413-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dromedary","Coxiella"],"organizations":["Rift Valley","MERS"],"locations":["Africa","Middle East","sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["dromedary camels","hardiness of camels","humans","camels Camelus dromedarius","camel herds","Camel populations","literature review of camel","arid regions","meat","surge of MERS","MERS outbreaks","major zoonotic diseases present","arid areas","domesticated species","production animals","Middle East respiratory syndrome","sub-Saharan Africa","point source","immediate response","risk of zoonoses","related publications","majority of publications","Congo hemorrhagic fever","non-domestic species","Rift Valley fever","stable protein source","Coxiella burnetii","Crimean","lack of biosafety","brucellosis","Echinococcus granulosus","beasts of burden","highest numbers","wildlife","Yersinia pestis","overview","human demands","biosecurity protocols","concern","research community","vector","interface","recommendations","disease-causing agents","growth","high fatality","milk","spillover events","prolonged droughts","surveillance efforts","ability"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Babapoor-Farrokhran, Savalan; Gill, Deanna; Walker, Jackson; Rasekhi, Roozbeh Tarighati; Bozorgnia, Behnam; Amanullah, Aman","journal":"Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35d28677e3b73accc05dbedf9a35fa836b976ca6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360126/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520304719?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117723; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520304719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["severe disease","SARS-CoV","Abstract Coronavirus Disease","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","disease spectrum","coronary heart disease","severe cases of COVID","severe pneumonia","severe symptoms","proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury","MERS-CoV","infected patients","major cardiovascular disease comorbidities","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","coronavirus infections","Respiratory illness","cardiac troponins","cardiac dysfunction","cardiac involvement","myocardial interstitial fibrosis","major cause of morbidity","increased cardiac biomarkers","cardiomyopathy","pathophysiological resemblance of SARS","important pathogenic features of COVID","immune response","heart failure","exact mechanisms","exaggerated cytokine response","coronary plaque destabilization","asymptomatic subclinical infection","helper T cells","interferon","systemic inflammation","Type","cardiomyocytes","direct damage","multiple studies","addition","arrhythmia","mortality","receptors","pivotal role","surrogate","Enzyme","pathogenesis","hypoxia","evidence","Hypertension","literature","global health emergency","Angiotensin","Disruption","Myocarditis"],"language":"en"},

More recently, it has been shown that mild G6PD deficiency moderately affects cardiac function, whereas severe G6PD deficiency leads to embryonic lethality in mice. How G6PD deficiency affects organisms has not been fully elucidated due to the lack of a suitable animal model. In this study, G6PD-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans was established by RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown to delineate the role of G6PD in animal physiology. Upon G6PD RNAi knockdown, G6PD activity was significantly hampered in C. elegans in parallel with increased oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. Phenotypically, G6PD-knockdown enhanced germ cell apoptosis (2-fold increase), reduced egg production (65% of mock), and hatching (10% of mock). To determine whether oxidative stress is associated with G6PD knockdown-induced reproduction defects, C. elegans was challenged with a short-term hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The early phase egg production of both mock and G6PD-knockdown C. elegans were significantly affected by H(2)O(2). However, H(2)O(2)-induced germ cell apoptosis was more dramatic in mock than that in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in defective oogenesis and embryogenesis caused by G6PD knockdown, mutants of p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were examined. Despite the upregulation of CEP-1 (p53), cep-1 mutation did not affect egg production and hatching in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Neither pmk-1 nor mek-1 mutation significantly affected egg production, whereas sek-1 mutation further decreased egg production in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Intriguingly, loss of function of sek-1 or mek-1 dramatically rescued defective hatching (8.3- and 9.6-fold increase, respectively) induced by G6PD knockdown. Taken together, these findings show that G6PD knockdown reduces egg production and hatching in C. elegans, which are possibly associated with enhanced oxidative stress and altered MAPK pathways, respectively.","publish_time":"2013-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, H-C; Chen, T-L; Wu, Y-H; Cheng, K-P; Lin, Y-H; Cheng, M-L; Ho, H-Y; Lo, S J; Chiu, D T-Y","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0187a691be1237e922515d56bcfbc7ec988fa3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3674345.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23640458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of G6PD","G6PD activity","G6PD RNAi knockdown","G6PD-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans","severe G6PD deficiency","mild G6PD deficiency","G6PD knockdown-induced reproduction defects","G6PD-knockdown enhanced germ cell apoptosis","reduced egg production","mock","early phase egg production","enhanced oxidative stress","mutation","defective hatching","increased oxidative stress","induced germ cell apoptosis","DNA oxidative damage","altered MAPK pathways","fold increase","mek","sek","mutants of p53","cardiac function","loss of function","defective oogenesis","animal physiology","upregulation of CEP","suitable animal model","mitogen-activated protein kinase","embryogenesis","RNA interference","embryonic lethality","lack","short-term hydrogen peroxide","phosphate dehydrogenase","study","mice","Glucose","organisms","favism","findings","hemolytic anemia","human","pmk"],"language":"en"},

Mass spectrometry systems have been investigated for the identification of respiratory viruses. However, sample preparation methods were laborious and time-consuming. In this study, a reliable and rapid sample preparation method was developed allowing identification of cultured respiratory viruses. Tenfold serial dilutions of ten cultures influenza A strains, mixed samples of influenza A virus with human metapneumovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, and reconstituted clinical samples were treated with the developed sample preparation method. Subsequently, peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). The influenza A strains were identified to the subtype level within 3h with MALDI-TOF MS and 6h with LC\u2013MS/MS, excluding the culturing time. The sensitivity of LC\u2013MS/MS was higher compared to MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, LC\u2013MS/MS was able to discriminate between two viruses in mixed samples and was able to identify virus from reconstituted clinical samples.

However, little is known about JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected immature dendritic cells (iDCs). Thus, iDCs were induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and performed to explore the expressions and phosphorylation of molecules in the two signaling pathways as well as secretions of inflammatory cytokines and interferons during EV71 replication. RESULTS: We showed that EV71 infection could activate both JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in iDCs and phosphorylate their downstream transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun, which further promoted the production of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03B1. Moreover, EV71 infection also increased the release of IFN-\u03B2 and IL-12 p40. Pretreatment of iDCs with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 \u03BCM) could severely impair viral replication and its induced phosphorylation of JNK1/2,p38 MAPK, c-Fos and c-Jun. In addition, treatment of EV71-infected iDCs with SP600125 and SB203580 could inhibit secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03B1. CONCLUSION: JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are beneficial to EV71 infection and positively regulate secretions of inflammatory cytokines in iDCs.","publish_time":"2014-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Hongjun; Shi, Mei; Zhang, Li; Li, Yuanyuan; Sun, Jing; Zhang, Lirong; Wang, Xiaohui; Xu, Xiaopeng; Zhang, Xiaolei; Mao, Yijie; Ji, Yun; Jiang, Jingting; Shi, Weifeng","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ebb0d128a1f03635f662f5419927c90c61855e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4057572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906853/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-14-147","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p38 MAPK","EV71 infection","EV71 replication","secretions of IL","infected iDCs","treatment of EV71","Pretreatment of iDCs","production of IL","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","induced phosphorylation of JNK1","viral replication","secretions of inflammatory cytokines","stress-activated kinase","terminal kinase","downstream transcription factors c-Fos","SB203580","SP600125","TNF-\u03B1","important components of cellular signal transduction pathways","infected immature dendritic cells","phosphorylation of molecules","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","SAPK","addition","interferons","enterovirus","release of IFN","PBMC","NH","\u03BCM","expressions","BACKGROUND","p40","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In 60 ARDS patients, we measured EVLW (PiCCO2 device) at a PEEP level set to reach a plateau pressure of 30 cmH(2)O (HighPEEP(start)) and 15 and 45 min after decreasing PEEP to 5 cmH(2)O (LowPEEP(15\u2032) and LowPEEP(45\u2032), respectively). Then, we increased PEEP back to the baseline level (HighPEEP(end)). Between HighPEEP(start) and LowPEEP(15\u2032), we estimated the degree of lung derecruitment either by measuring changes in the compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) in the whole population, or by measuring the lung derecruited volume in 30 patients. We defined patients with a large derecruitment from the other ones as patients in whom the Crs changes and the measured derecruited volume were larger than the median of these variables observed in the whole population. RESULTS: Reducing PEEP from HighPEEP(start) (14 \u00B1 2 cmH(2)O) to LowPEEP(15\u2032) significantly decreased EVLW from 20 \u00B1 4 to 18 \u00B1 4 mL/kg, central venous pressure (CVP) from 15 \u00B1 4 to 12 \u00B1 4 mmHg, the arterial oxygen tension over inspired oxygen fraction (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio from 184 \u00B1 76 to 150 \u00B1 69 mmHg and lung volume by 144 [68\u2013420] mL. The EVLW decrease was similar in \u201Clarge derecruiters\u201D and the other patients. When PEEP was re-increased to HighPEEP(end), CVP, PaO(2)/FiO(2) and EVLW significantly re-increased. At linear mixed effect model, EVLW changes were significantly determined only by changes in PEEP and CVP (p \u003C 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively, n = 60). When the same analysis was performed by estimating recruitment according to lung volume changes (n = 30), CVP remained significantly associated to the changes in EVLW (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ARDS patients, changing the PEEP level induced parallel, small and reversible changes in EVLW. These changes were not due to an artefact of the TPTD technique and were likely due to the PEEP-induced changes in CVP, which is the backward pressure of the lung lymphatic drainage.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this AQP2 reduction is incompletely understood. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we studied molecular changes in IMCDs isolated from rats with 4-h BUO or sham operation at the early onset of AQP2 downregulation using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Two-hundred fifteen proteins had significant changes in abundances, with 65% of them downregulated in the IMCD of 4-h BUO rats compared with sham rats. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that significantly changed proteins were associated with functional Gene Ontology terms, including \u201Ccell-cell adhesion,\u201D \u201Ccell-cell adherens junction,\u201D \u201Cmitochondrial inner membrane,\u201D \u201Cendoplasmic reticulum chaperone complex,\u201D and the KEGG pathway of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or immunoblot analysis confirmed the changes in 19 proteins representative of each predominant cluster, including AQP2. Electron microscopy demonstrated disrupted tight junctions, disorganized adherens junctions, swollen mitochondria, enlargement of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and numerous autophagosomes/lysosomes in the IMCD of rats with 4-h BUO. AQP2 and seven proteins chosen as representative of the significantly altered clusters had a significant increase in immunofluorescence-based colocalization with autophagosomes/lysosomes. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed colocalization of AQP2 with the autophagosome marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D in IMCD cells of rats with 4-h BUO. We conclude that enhanced autophagic degradation of AQP2 and other critical proteins, as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress in the IMCD, are initiated shortly after BUO.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Somparn, Poorichaya; Boonkrai, Chatikorn; Charngkaew, Komgrid; Chomanee, Nusara; Hodge, Kenneth G.; Fenton, Robert A.; Pisitkun, Trairak; Khositseth, Sookkasem","journal":"Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7054639.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BUO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IMCD of rats","h BUO rats","colocalization of AQP2","AQP2 reduction","IMCD cells of rats","sham rats","proteins representative","cell-cell adhesion","critical proteins","cell-cell adherens junction","early onset of AQP2 downregulation","enhanced autophagic degradation of AQP2","significant changes","molecular changes","endoplasmic reticulum lumen","endoplasmic reticulum stress","endoplasmic reticulum chaperone complex","lysosomes","proteomic analysis","Bioinformatic analysis","disorganized adherens junctions","immunofluorescence-based colocalization","underlying molecular mechanism","Immunogold electron microscopy","autophagosome marker microtubule-associated protein","numerous autophagosomes","sham operation","significant increase","disrupted tight junctions","mitochondrial inner membrane","Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","lysosomal marker cathepsin D","impaired urine concentration mechanism","inner medullary collecting duct","postobstructive diuresis","swollen mitochondria","enlargement","reduced aquaporin","release of bilateral ureteral obstruction","functional Gene Ontology terms","B-light chain","KEGG pathway of glycolysis","clusters","phenomenon","predominant cluster","gluconeogenesis","abundances","IMCDs","mechanisms responsible"],"language":"en"},

The treatment of ARDS to date is focused on the prevention of further iatrogenic damage of the lung rather than the treatment of the initial inflammatory process. Several preclinical studies have revealed a beneficial effect of iloprost on the control of pulmonary inflammation, and in a small number of patients with ARDS, iloprost treatment resulted in improved oxygenation. Therefore, we plan to conduct a large multicenter trial to evaluate the effect of iloprost on ARDS. METHODS: The Therapeutic Iloprost during ARDS trial (ThIlo trial) is a multicenter, randomized, single blinded, clinical phase II trial assessing the efficacy of inhaled iloprost for the prevention of the development and progression of ARDS in critically ill patients. One hundred fifty critically ill patients suffering from acute ARDS will be treated either by nebulized iloprost or NaCl 0.9% for 5 days. Blood samples will be drawn at defined time points to elucidate the serum levels of iloprost and inflammatory markers during treatment. Mechanical ventilation will be standardized. In follow-up visits at days 28 and 90 as well as 6 months after enrollment, functional status according to the Barthel Index and a health care-related questionnaire, and frailty (Vulnerable Elders Survey) will be evaluated. The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation, defined as the ratio of PaO(2)/FiO(2). Secondary endpoints include 90-day all-cause mortality, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores during the study period up to day 90, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ventilator-associated pneumonia, delirium, ICU-acquired weakness, and discharge localization. The study will be conducted in three university ARDS centers in Germany. DISCUSSION: The results of the ThIlo trial will highlight the anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost on early inflammatory processes during ARDS, resulting in the improvement of outcome parameters in patients with ARDS.

We hypothesize that partial preservation of diaphragm function, such as during assisted modes of ventilation, will restore diaphragm thickness. We also aim to correlate the changes in diaphragm thickness and function to outcomes and clinical factors. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicentre, observational study. Patients mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h in controlled mode and eventually switched to assisted ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm ultrasound and clinical data collection were performed every 48 h until discharge or death. A threshold of 10% was used to define thinning during controlled and recovery of thickness during assisted ventilation. Patients were also classified based on the level of diaphragm activity during assisted ventilation. We evaluated the association between changes in diaphragm thickness and activity and clinical outcomes and data, such as ventilation parameters. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients ventilated in controlled mode and then switched to the assisted mode of ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm thickness significantly decreased during controlled ventilation (1.84 \u00B1 0.44 to 1.49 \u00B1 0.37 mm, p \u003C 0.001) and was partially restored during assisted ventilation (1.49 \u00B1 0.37 to 1.75 \u00B1 0.43 mm, p \u003C 0.001). A diaphragm thinning of more than 10% was associated with longer duration of controlled ventilation (10 [5, 15] versus 5 [4, 8.5] days, p = 0.004) and higher PEEP levels (12.6 \u00B1 4 versus 10.4 \u00B1 4 cmH(2)O, p = 0.034). An increase in diaphragm thickness of more than 10% during assisted ventilation was not associated with any clinical outcome but with lower respiratory rate (16.7 \u00B1 3.2 versus 19.2 \u00B1 4 bpm, p = 0.019) and Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (37 \u00B1 11 versus 44 \u00B1 13, p = 0.029) and with higher Pressure Muscle Index (2 [0.5, 3] versus 0.4 [0, 1.9], p = 0.024). Change in diaphragm thickness was not related to diaphragm function expressed as diaphragm thickening fraction. CONCLUSION: Mode of ventilation affects diaphragm thickness, and preservation of diaphragmatic contraction, as during assisted modes, can partially reverse the muscle atrophy process. Avoiding a strenuous inspiratory work, as measured by Rapid Shallow Breathing Index and Pressure Muscle Index, may help diaphragm thickness restoration.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grassi, Alice; Ferlicca, Daniela; Lupieri, Ermes; Calcinati, Serena; Francesconi, Silvia; Sala, Vittoria; Ormas, Valentina; Chiodaroli, Elena; Abbruzzese, Chiara; Curto, Francesco; Sanna, Andrea; Zambon, Massimo; Fumagalli, Roberto; Foti, Giuseppe; Bellani, Giacomo","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c449725d0ff82ba8e5b969f91ea8b3183f046ff8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068963.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068963/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid Shallow Breathing","Rapid Shallow"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assisted ventilation","Diaphragm atrophy","diaphragm thickness restoration","Diaphragm ultrasound","assisted mode of ventilation","assisted modes of ventilation","ventilation parameters","level of diaphragm activity","partial preservation of diaphragm function","recovery of thickness","longer duration of controlled ventilation","consequences of mechanical ventilation","controlled mode","determinants of clinical outcomes","clinical factors","Patients","higher Pressure Muscle Index","clinical data collection","Rapid Shallow Breathing Index","muscle atrophy process","changes","thinning","preservation of diaphragmatic contraction","higher PEEP levels","dysfunction","lower respiratory rate","observational study","strenuous inspiratory work","BACKGROUND","association","fraction","CONCLUSION","discharge","death","cmH","RESULTS","increase","METHODS","days","bpm","threshold"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to prospectively validate ENDING-S in a cohort of long-term critical care patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult long-term ICU patients (with a length-of-stay\u003E 4 days) were considered for this prospective multicenter observational study. ENDING-S and SOFA score were calculated daily and evaluated against the patient\u2019s ICU outcome. The predictive properties were evaluated through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients were enrolled for this study. Among these, 21.46% died during the ICU stay. ENDING-S correctly predicted the ICU outcome in 71.4% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values associated with the previously identified ENDING-S cut-off of 11.5 were 68.1, 72.3, 60 and 89.3%, respectively.

METHODS: Adult patients with septic shock underwent volume mechanical ventilation between October 2015 and October 2016. RR was started at 10 breaths/min, and 2 breaths/min were added every 60 min until 16 breaths/min was reached. At every point, central venous and arterial blood gas measurements were obtained simultaneously. RESULTS: In this study, gapCO(2) induced by hyperventilation significantly increased, while the central venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO(2)) and the partial pressure of CO(2) (PaCO(2)) in arteries decreased. The decreasing trend of the PaCO(2) was more obvious than that of the PvCO(2). HCO(3)(\u2212) and ctCO(2) were markedly decreased, when the RR was increased (P \u003C 0.05). Central venous oxygen saturation (S(cv)O(2)) had a decreasing trend between 14 (77.1 \u00B1 8.3%) and 16 (75.2 \u00B1 8.7%) breaths/min; however, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In septic patients undergoing ventilation, respiratory alkalosis induced by hyperventilation caused an increase in the gapCO(2). Clinicians should cautiously interpret the gapCO(2) in hemodynamically stable ventilated septic shock patients and its relationship with low cardiac output and inadequate perfusion.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Zhixiang; Wang, Yapeng; Xie, Chao; Hua, Guofang; Ge, Shenglin; Li, Yuedong","journal":"Eur J Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ae27ceb22429e6673767304ac3369a7cbe059db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7076974.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7076974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["venous-to-arterial CO","RR","CO","HCO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["septic patients","gapCO","breaths","RR","stable ventilated septic shock patients","Adult patients","volume mechanical ventilation","Central venous oxygen saturation","central venous carbon dioxide pressure","hyperventilation","PvCO","PaCO","decreasing trend","respiratory alkalosis","respiratory rate","partial pressure","tension difference","arterial blood gas measurements","relationship","low cardiac output","cv","inadequate perfusion","effects","point","METHODS","increase","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","study","BACKGROUND","arteries","Clinicians","HCO","ctCO"],"language":"en"},

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.

Although a new definition has been recently proposed (Berlin definition), there are various forms of ARDS with potential differences regarding their management (ventilator settings, prone positioning use, corticosteroids). ARDS can be caused by various aetiologies, and the adequate treatment of the responsible cause is crucial to improve the outcome. It is of paramount importance to characterize the mechanisms causing lung injury to optimize both the aetiological treatment and the symptomatic treatment. If there is no obvious cause of ARDS or if a direct lung injury is suspected, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be strongly considered to identify microorganisms responsible for pneumonia. Blood samples can also help to identify microorganisms and to evaluate biomarkers of infection. If there is no infectious cause of ARDS or no other apparent aetiology is found, second-line examinations should include markers of immunologic diseases. In selected cases, open lung biopsy remains useful to identify the cause of ARDS when all other examinations remain inconclusive. CT scan is fundamental when there is a suspicion of intra-abdominal sepsis and in some cases of pneumonia. Ultrasonography is important not only in evaluating biventricular function but also in identifying pleural effusions and pneumothorax.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the radiographic features of SARS in a cluster of affected children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chest radiographs of four related children ranging in age from 18 months to 9 years diagnosed as having SARS were reviewed for the presence of air-space shadowing, air bronchograms, peribronchial thickening, interstitial disease, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, hilar lymphadenopathy and mediastinal widening. RESULTS: Ill-defined air-space shadowing was the common finding in all the children. The distribution was unifocal or multifocal. No other findings were seen on the radiographs. None of the children developed radiographic findings consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome. All four children showed significant resolution of the radiographic findings 4\u20136 days after the initial radiograph. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of these features is important in implementing isolation and containment measures to prevent the spread of infection.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study involving retrospective analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data. SETTING: Adult intensive care unit in a tertiary referral university hospital involved in a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). PATIENTS: The first 54 patients admitted with SARS to an intensive care unit (ICU). All were treated with corticosteroids, ribavirin, broad spectrum antimicrobials and supportive therapy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All patients were admitted for respiratory failure. The median APACHE II score was 11 (interquartile range 8\u201313). At 28 days 34 patients (63%; 95% CI 49.6\u201374.6) were alive and not mechanically ventilated. Six patients were alive but ventilated (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 5.3\u201322.6) and 14 had died (25.9%; CI 16.1\u201338.9). Seven of 27 ventilated patients developed evidence of barotrauma (25.9%; 95% CI 13.2\u201344.7). Median maximal multiple-organ dysfunction score was 5 (interquartile range 3.3\u20139). Median maximal respiratory dysfunction score was 3 (interquartile range 3\u20134). Increased age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, decreased steroid dose, positive fluid balance, chronic disease or immunosuppression and nosocomial sepsis were associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis. Poor outcome was defined as death or need for mechanical ventilation at 28 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality amongst critically ill patients with SARS is high. It causes predominantly severe respiratory failure, with little other organ failure, and a high incidence of barotrauma amongst those requiring mechanical ventilation.

Another major enzyme encoded by many viruses is a protease responsible for the processing of virus-encoded polyproteins. The HIV protease has been very successfully targeted, and hepatitis C virus and rhinovirus protease inhibitors are being actively developed. The complex series of interactions during virus entry is a rapidly emerging and promising target for inhibitors of HIV and many other viruses. New anti-influenza drugs inhibit virus release from infected cells. Several stages of the viral life cycle remain incompletely characterized and are therefore poorly exploited in antiviral strategies. These include, among others, the RNA capping reactions catalyzed by many viruses, as well as the membrane association of replication complexes which is common to all positive-strand RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2004-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magden, Julia; K\u00E4\u00E4ri\u00E4inen, Leevi; Ahola, Tero","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dba333288b0b21947b70f8726c0358b59819d367.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7082807.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082807/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of viral replication","viral DNA replication","inhibitors of HIV","viral infection","HIV protease","viral life cycle","viral nucleic acid replication","rhinovirus protease inhibitors","virus release","virus entry","processing of virus","antiviral drugs","major target of anti-HIV compounds","Classical inhibitors of herpesvirus replication cause chain termination","hepatitis C virus","membrane association of replication complexes","positive-strand RNA viruses","HIV reverse transcriptase","protease responsible","antiviral strategies","New anti-influenza drugs","promising target","broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin","major enzyme","encoded polyproteins","RNA capping reactions","potential targets","events","molecular level","place","multiple mechanisms","infected cells","complex series of interactions","essential steps","stages","search"],"language":"en"},

Unless the patient has bacteraemia or pleural empyema, aetiological diagnostics are limited and antibiotic treatment is empirical. Published data on expected response to therapy are scarce. To determine the clinical response to antibiotic treatment in a developed country in otherwise healthy children with community-acquired pneumonia, we conducted a prospective study of 153 hospitalised children with pneumonia. The role of 17 microbes as potential causative agents was evaluated. The duration of fever (\u003E37.5\u00B0C) and hospitalisation were studied as objective measures of recovery. A potential aetiology was found in 83% of 153 patients: 29% of the patients had sole viral and 26% sole bacterial and 29% mixed viral-bacterial infections. The median duration of fever after the onset of antibiotic treatment (mainly penicillin G) was 14 h and the median duration of hospitalisation was 48 h. Patients with mixed viral-bacterial infection became afebrile more slowly than those with either sole viral or sole bacterial infections.

Fifteen Korean IBV isolates were classified into 4 groups by their RFLP patterns using restriction enzymes, HaeIII, BstYI, and XcmI. The RFLP patterns for 3, 1, and 1 of 15 isolates corresponded to the patterns of IBV Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts strains, respectively. Ten of 15 isolates generated unique KM91 RFLP pattern that was observed in the IBV KM 91 strain previously isolated in Korea. To confirm genetic diversity in the S1 genes of IBV isolates, viral RNAs of representative 9 of 15 IBV isolates were amplified, cloned, sequenced and compared with published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains. Korean IBV isolates showed amino acid sequence similarity between 61.8% (K446-01 and K161-02) and 96.1% (K281-01 and K210-02) with each other and they showed amino acid sequence similarity between 42.9% (K161-02 and GA980470) and 96.5% (K203-02 and KB8523) compared to non-Korean IBV strains. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean IBV field isolates were branched into five clusters in which 3 clusters were differentiated from non-Korean IBV strains. Especially, Korean IBV isolates K069-01, K507-01, K774-01 and K142-02 formed a separate cluster.

METHODS: Within PID-ARI.net, a research network for ARI in children in Germany, an active, year-round surveillance system was formed in three regions from north to south for population-based analysis. Children from birth to 16 years of age were included and up to 19 noncolonizing airway pathogens were tested for with multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the 10-year period from July 1996 to June 2006, a total of 18,899 samples were tested. The positive rate increased with the size of the test panel to up to 72.9%. Picornaviruses (35\u201339%), paramyxoviruses (23\u201328%) and orthomyxoviruses (5.8\u201312.5%) comprised the highest fraction. Reoviruses and Legionella pneumophila were not found at all and Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella parapertussis only rarely. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 were anticyclical in rhythmicity with metapneumovirus and PIV1 and PIV2. The age medians per pathogen depended predominantly upon the attack rate and interepidemic intervals. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance systems for ARI are superior to passive systems. They should be pathogen-specific and comprehensive for viruses and bacteria and age ranges. They should be population-based and multilevel to avoid bias. The impact of atypical bacteria in children was highly overestimated in earlier studies.","publish_time":"2007-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weigl, Josef A.

Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate \u201Chotspot\u201D maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives. These areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations, close proximity to apes, and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals.","publish_time":"2010-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Amy B.; Davies, T.

The aim of this study was to establish the dose-response relationship of the inhibition of proteolysis as assessed by FIZ with E-64 at different dosages in a murine model of fasciolosis. Maximum effective inhibition of proteolysis was achieved at 50 mg/kg/day (87%). Mice treated with this dose survived for a mean of 10.92 days more than untreated controls, and their ova counts and egg viability were significantly (P\u003C0.05) lower than this latter group. These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of E-64 not only inhibited liver proteolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner but also produced anti-fecundity and anti-embryonation effects, delaying the progression of fasciolosis.

In this paper, based on the concept of the pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, K. C. PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 2001, 43: 246\u2013255), the approach of cellular automata image is introduced to cope with this problem. Many important features, which are originally hidden in the long amino acid sequences, can be clearly displayed through their cellular automata images. One of the remarkable merits by doing so is that many image recognition tools can be straightforwardly applied to the target aimed here. High success rates were observed through the self-consistency, jackknife, and independent dataset tests, respectively.","publish_time":"2005-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, X.; Shao, S.; Ding, Y.; Huang, Z.; Chou, K.-C.","journal":"Amino Acids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cbe356aa791fa3bfa20fec5b0f2c346b3e51713.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chou","K.

Since many of its potential target enzymes in the eye reside in intracellular compartments, we sought evidence for a cellular uptake of the inhibitor in ocular tissues. METHODS: Fluorescence-labeled human cystatin C was injected intravitreally into normal rat eyes. Ocular tissues were subsequently examined using ELISA, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Cystatin C uptake was additionally studied in an in vitro retina model. RESULTS: Cystatin C administered intravitreally in vivo is taken up into cells of the corneal endothelium and epithelium, the epithelial cells lining the ciliary processes, and into cells in the neuroretina (mostly ganglion cells) and the retinal pigment epithelium. The uptake is demonstrable also in vitro and was, in the neuroretina, found to be a high-affinity system, inhibited by cooling the specimens or by adding the microfilament polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D, to the medium. CONCLUSIONS: There is an active, temperature-dependent uptake system for cystatin C into several cell types in the cornea, ciliary body, and retina. The cell types that take up cystatin C are generally the same that contain endogenous cystatin C, suggesting that much or all cystatin C seen intracellularly in the normal eye may have been taken up from the surrounding extracellular space. The uptake indicates that the inhibitor may exert biological functions in intracellular compartments. It is also possible that this uptake system may regulate the extracellular levels of cystatin C in the eye.","publish_time":"2004-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wass\u00E9lius, Johan; Johansson, Kjell; H\u00E5kansson, Katarina; Abrahamson, Magnus; Ehinger, Berndt","journal":"Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a17c8b1ed780b4c9faa238ce5e34f09814fb4ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cystatin C uptake","human cystatin C","endogenous cystatin C","extracellular levels of cystatin C","cellular uptake","temperature-dependent uptake system","epithelial cells","ganglion cells","normal eye","cell types","intracellular compartments","extracellular compartment","ocular tissues","neuroretina","microfilament polymerization inhibitor","high-affinity system","surrounding extracellular space","ciliary body","ciliary processes","fluorescence microscopy","retina model","retinal pigment epithelium","normal rat eyes","mammalian legumain-related proteases","cysteine proteases of families C1","cathepsin B","C13","cytochalasin D","ELISA","corneal endothelium","biological functions","evidence","secreted protein","potential target enzymes","immunohistochemistry","specimens","METHODS","role","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened. The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries. METHODS: In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. We divide a city\u0027s population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations. FINDINGS: We focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen. INTERPRETATION: With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA sensors. The binding of PAMPs to these receptors triggers the production of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which protect surrounding cells from infection. Some ISGs are nucleic acids-binding proteins that bind viral nucleic acids and suppress their replication. As nucleic acids are essential components that store and transmit genetic information in every species, infectious pathogens have developed systems to escape from the host nucleic acid recognition system. Host cells also have their own nucleic acids that are frequently released to the extracellular milieu or the cytoplasm during cell death or stress responses, which, if able to bind pattern-recognition receptors, would induce autoimmunity and inflammation. Therefore, host cells have acquired mechanisms to protect themselves from contact with their own nucleic acids. In this review, we describe recent research progress into the nucleic acid recognition mechanism and the molecular bases of discrimination between self and non-self-nucleic acids.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kawasaki, Takumi; Kawai, Taro","journal":"International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b54cb4255fa62b88defc1f51d8fc3273d808b9fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105031.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644818300935; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798985/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644818300935","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral nucleic acids","nucleic acids-binding proteins","non-self-nucleic acids","nucleic acid recognition mechanism","host nucleic acid recognition system","cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors","Host cells","ISGs","binding of PAMPs","IFN","surrounding cells","molecular patterns","production of type","molecular bases of discrimination","innate immune system","cytosolic DNA sensors","expression of interferon stimulated genes","various types of pathogen","cytoplasm","bacterial infections","recent research progress","cell death","species","genetic information","stress responses","ALRs","systems","infectious pathogens","essential components","AIM2","series of membrane","extracellular milieu","review","Abstract","inflammatory cytokines","TLRs","mechanisms","autoimmunity","RIG","RLRs","contact","replication","Toll","inflammation"],"language":"en"},

As a result, mechanisms behind the benefits of nanoparticle vaccines can often find analogue to the interaction dynamics between the immune system and viruses. This review covers the advances in vaccine nanotechnology with a perspective on the advantages of virus mimicry towards immune potentiation. It provides an overview to the different types of nanomaterials utilized for nanoparticle vaccine development, including functionalization strategies that bestow nanoparticles with virus-like features. As understanding of human immunity and vaccine mechanisms continue to evolve, recognizing the fundamental semblance between synthetic nanoparticles and viruses may offer an explanation for the superiority of nanoparticle vaccines over conventional vaccines and may spur new design rationales for future vaccine research.

METHODS/DESIGN: We are enrolling a hospital-based cohort and a sample of non-ill infants in four countries (Albania, Jordan, Nicaragua, and the Philippines) using a common protocol. We are currently starting year 2 of a 2- to 3-year study and will enroll approximately 3,000 infants hospitalized for any acute illness (respiratory or non-respiratory) during periods of local influenza and/or RSV circulation. After informed consent and within 24 h of admission, we collect blood and respiratory specimens and conduct an interview to assess socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, and symptoms of acute illness (onset \u226410 days). Vital signs, interventions, and medications are documented daily through medical record abstraction. A follow-up health assessment and collection of convalescent blood occurs 3-5 weeks after enrollment. Influenza and RSV infection is confirmed by singleplex real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. Serologic conversion will be assessed comparing acute and convalescent sera using hemagglutination inhibition assay for influenza antibodies and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for RSV. Concurrent with hospital-based enrollment, respiratory specimens are also being collected (and tested by rRT-PCR) from approximately 1,400 non-ill infants aged \u003C1 year during routine medical or preventive care. DISCUSSION: The Influenza and RSV in Infants Study (IRIS) promises to expand our knowledge of the frequency, clinical features, and antibody profiles of serious influenza and RSV disease among infants aged \u003C1 year, quantify the proportion of infections that may be missed by traditional surveillance, and inform decisions about the potential value of existing and new vaccines and other prevention and treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2017-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Mark G.; Hunt, Danielle R.; Arbaji, Ali K.; Simaku, Artan; Tallo, Veronica L.; Biggs, Holly M.; Kulb, Carolyn; Gordon, Aubree; Khader, Ilham Abu; Bino, Silvia; Lucero, Marilla G.; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Shifflett, Pat; Sanchez, Felix; Marar, Basima I.; Bakalli, Ilirjana; Sim\u00F5es, Eric A.

Currently, the spectrum of clinical disease and the understanding of host susceptibility factors are changing. Cases of chronic norovirus gastroenteritis have been observed in transplant recipients and unusual clinical presentations have been recognized in otherwise healthy adults that are under physical stress. Recently, noroviruses were found to bind to gut-expressed carbohydrates, leading to a correlation between a person\u0027s genetically determined carbohydrate expression and their susceptibility to Norwalk virus infection. Greater community surveillance and further investigation of carbohydrate receptor-binding properties could provide further insights into norovirus transmission, susceptibility and pathogenesis, and should aid in developing vaccines and antiviral therapies for this common viral disease.","publish_time":"2004-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hutson, Anne M; Atmar, Robert L; Estes, Mary K","journal":"Trends Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7019d741561deb8233d17bb81ea097662fe0f8eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172956.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X04000964; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X04000964","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["norovirus transmission","common viral disease","sporadic disease","spectrum of clinical disease","Cases of chronic norovirus gastroenteritis","infectious virus particles","Norwalk virus infection","increased recognition of noroviruses","majority of acute viral gastroenteritis cases","understanding of host susceptibility factors","high stability","high prevalence","cause of outbreaks","determined carbohydrate expression","recent availability of improved norovirus-specific diagnostics","unusual clinical presentations","Greater community surveillance","investigation of carbohydrate receptor-binding properties","antiviral therapies","asymptomatic individuals","transplant recipients","insights","developing vaccines","correlation","person\u0027s","pathogenesis","healthy adults","physical stress","carbohydrates","gut","environment"],"language":"en"},

The evolutionary distances are obtained through measuring the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. The Z-curve is approximately described by its geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors, which indicate the center position and the trend of the Z-curve, respectively. Although some information is lost due to the approximate description of the Z-curve, the phylogenetic tree constructed based on these parameters is consistent with those of previous analyses. The present method has the merits of simplicity and intuitiveness, but it is still in its premature stage.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemics on stroke management during the first month of Italy lockdown. In addition, we described the emergency structured pathway adopted by an Italian University Hub Stroke Unit in the cross-border Italy-Slovenia area. Methods We analyzed admitted patients\u0027 clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019. Results Total admissions experienced a reduction of 45% during the lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (16 vs 29, respectively), as well as a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS\u003E10) at admission (n = 8, 50% vs n = 8, 28%). A dramatic prevalence of stroke of unknown symptom onset was observed in 2020 (n = 8, 50% vs n = 3, 10%). During lockdown, worse functional and independence outcomes were found, despite the similar proportion of reperfused patients. Similar \u2018symptoms alert-to-admission\u2019 and \u2018door-to-treatment\u2019 times were observed. During lockdown hospitalization was shorter and fewer patients completed the stroke work-up. Conclusion In conclusion, the adopted strategies for stroke management during the COVID-19 emergency have suggested being effective, while suffering a reduced and delayed reporting of symptoms. Therefore, we recommend raising awareness among the population against possible stroke symptoms onset. Thus, think F.A.S.T. and do not stay-at-home at all costs.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naccarato, Marcello; Scali, Ilario; Olivo, Sasha; Aj\u010Devi\u0107, Milos; Stella, Alex Buoite; Furlanis, Giovanni; Lugnan, Carlo; Caruso, Paola; Peratoner, Alberto; Cominotto, Franco; Manganotti, Paolo","journal":"J Neurol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f61f38726ad0e68770581001126c9ccc25ecd526.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201240.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20302252; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116889; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20302252?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stroke management","stroke work","dramatic prevalence of stroke","possible stroke symptoms onset","month of lockdown","vs n","higher prevalence of severe stroke","COVID","month of Italy lockdown","lockdown hospitalization","Italian University Hub Stroke Unit","pandemics","fewer patients","Conclusion","symptoms alert","period","similar proportion of reperfused patients","delayed reporting of symptoms","independence outcomes","admitted patients\u0027 clinical features","adopted strategies","functional characteristics","unknown symptom onset","emergency structured pathway","cross-border Italy-Slovenia area","NIHSS","population","Methods","changes","door","reduction","Abstract Background","awareness","treatment","times","Total admissions","addition","effects","costs"],"language":"en"},

The murine IFN-\u03B3 gene was cloned into the DI vector under the control of an MHV transcriptional promoter and transfected into MHV-infected cells. IFN-\u03B3 was secreted into culture medium as early as 6 hr posttransfection and reached a peak level (up to 180 U/ml) at 12 hr posttransfection. The DI-expressed IFN-\u03B3 (DE-IFN-\u03B3) exhibited an antiviral activity comparable to that of recombinant IFN-\u03B3 and was blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IFN-\u03B3. Treatment of macrophages with DE-IFN-\u03B3 selectively induced the expression of the cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase and the IFN-\u03B3-inducing factor (IGIF) but did not affect the amounts of the MHV receptor mRNA. Antiviral activity was detected only when cells were pretreated with IFN-\u03B3 for 24 hr prior to infection; no inhibition of virus replication was detected when cells were treated with IFN-\u03B3 during or after infection. Furthermore, addition of IFN-\u03B3 together with MHV did not prevent infection, but appeared to prevent subsequent viral spread. MHV variants with different degrees of neurovirulence in mice had correspondingly different levels of sensitivities to IFN-\u03B3 treatmentin vitro,with the most virulent strain being most resistant to IFN-\u03B3 treatment. Infection of susceptible mice with DE-IFN-\u03B3-containing virus caused significantly milder disease, accompanied by more pronounced mononuclear cell infiltrates into the CNS and less virus replication, than that caused by virus containing a control DI vector. This study thus demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of this MHV DI vector for expressing cytokines and may provide a model for studying the role of cytokines in MHV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"1997-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xuming; Hinton, David R.; Cua, Daniel J.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297985986; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297985986","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI","MHV","CNS","MHV DI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DE-IFN-\u03B3","recombinant IFN-\u03B3","murine IFN-\u03B3 gene","interferon-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B3 treatmentin vitro","addition of IFN","MHV DI vector","MHV variants","MHV pathogenesis","MHV-infected cells","control DI vector","MHV transcriptional promoter","MHV receptor mRNA","inhibition of virus replication","hr posttransfection","Infection of susceptible mice","murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","antiviral activity comparable","role of cytokines","Treatment of macrophages","different levels of sensitivities","different degrees of neurovirulence","CNS","cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase","expression","pronounced mononuclear cell infiltrates","usefulness","virulent strain","neutralizing monoclonal antibody","peak level","milder disease","feasibility","culture medium","model","defective-interfering","amounts","factor","subsequent viral spread","study","IGIF"],"language":"en"},

The signal for frameshifting is composed of two essential mRNA elements; a slippery sequence (AAAUUUA) where the ribosome changes reading frame, and a stimulatory RNA structure located immediately downstream. This RNA is predicted to be a complex stem-loop but may also form an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the RSV frameshift signal by a combination of enzymatic and chemical structure probing and site-directed mutagenesis. The stimulatory RNA is indeed a complex stem-loop with a long stable stem and two additional stem-loops contained as substructures within the main loop region. The substructures are not however required for frameshifting. Evidence for an additional interaction between a stretch of nucleotides in the main loop and a region downstream to generate an RNA pseudoknot was obtained from an analysis of the frameshifting properties of RSV mutants translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system. Mutations that disrupted the predicted pseudoknot-forming sequences reduced frameshifting but when the mutations were combined and should re-form the pseudoknot, frameshifting was restored to a level approaching that of the wild-type construct. It was also observed that the predicted pseudoknot-forming regions had reduced sensitivity to cleavage by the single-stranded probe imidazole. Overall, however, the structure probing data indicate that the pseudoknot interaction is weak and may form transiently. In comparison to other characterised RNA structures present at viral frameshift signals, the RSV stimulator falls into a novel group. It cannot be considered to be a simple hairpin-loop yet it is distinct from other well characterised frameshift-inducing RNA pseudoknots in that the overall contribution of the RSV pseudoknot to frameshifting is less dramatic.","publish_time":"1998-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marczinke, Beate; Fisher, Rosamond; Vidakovic, Marijana; Bloys, Alison J; Brierley, Ian","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bed7feba6e8eb740337967721fdfd733db7cbbe7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126186.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283698921866; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283698921866","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV pseudoknot","predicted pseudoknot","pseudoknot interaction","stimulatory RNA structure","RNA pseudoknots","complex stem-loop","frameshifting properties of RSV mutants","RSV frameshift signal","main loop region","RSV stimulator","ribosomal frameshifting event","characterised RNA structures present","characterised frameshift","chemical structure","additional stem-loops","simple hairpin-loop","long stable stem","overlap region","additional interaction","substructures","Mutations","viral frameshift signals","pol open reading frames","reduced sensitivity","overall contribution","Gag-Pol polyprotein of Rous sarcoma virus","cleavage","combination of enzymatic","rabbit reticulocyte lysate","slippery sequence","AAAUUUA","essential mRNA elements","regions","stretch of nucleotides","analysis","single-stranded probe imidazole","translation system","ribosome changes","site","comparison","sequences","Abstract Expression","novel group","data","wild-type construct","mutagenesis","Evidence","level"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic\u0027s peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 second-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p\u003C0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (\u003E24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p\u003E0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; McIntyre, Roger S.; Choo, Faith N.; Tran, Bach; Ho, Roger; Sharma, Vijay K.; Ho, Cyrus","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b557fb52771f9a5ff953ca9825f38e82dff33f50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153528.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120305110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298802/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120305110?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anxiety","survey respondents","mean IES-R scores","IES-R measures PTSD symptoms","Stress Scale","depression levels","significant longitudinal reduction","significant longitudinal changes","health information","severe stress","unbiased COVID","longitudinal study","mental health status","global mental health","levels of psychological impact","Impact of Event Scale","knowledge","personal precautionary measures","cut-off scores","cases","weeks","DASS","low risk of contracting COVID","public physical health emergency","effective methods","general population","initial outbreak","initial evaluation","general distress construct","correct containment methods","perceived survival likelihood","doctors","high level of confidence","commodities","surveying demographics","Coronavirus disease","satisfaction","concerns","epidemic\u0027s peak","availability of essential services","survivorship","Protective factors","world brace","escalation","distinct characteristics","Governments","tripartite model of psychopathology","sufficient financial support","Chinese cities","addition","panic","countries","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

They are composed of \u223C90 amino acids and form a classical two \u03B1-helical/six \u03B2-strand structure. The prototypical ligand is the C-terminus of partner proteins; however, they also bind internal peptide sequences. Recent findings indicate that PDZ domains also bind phosphatidylinositides and cholesterol. Through their ligand interactions, PDZ domain proteins are critical for cellular trafficking and the surface retention of various ion channels. In addition, PDZ proteins are essential for neuronal signaling, memory, and learning. PDZ proteins also contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics by mediating interactions critical for maintaining cell\u2013cell junctions, cell polarity, and cell migration. Given their important biological roles, it is not surprising that their dysfunction can lead to multiple disease states. As such, PDZ domain\u2013containing proteins have emerged as potential targets for the development of small molecular inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Recent data suggest that the critical binding function of PDZ domains in cell signaling is more than just glue, and their binding function can be regulated by phosphorylation or allosterically by other binding partners. These studies also provide a wealth of structural and biophysical data that are beginning to reveal the physical features that endow this small modular domain with a central role in cell signaling.","publish_time":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xu; Fuentes, Ernesto J.","journal":"Int Rev Cell Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0c4f1bdd3fe67c3d7501a7b2fbfc78f53c0d34f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185565.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.05.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644818300637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644818300637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDZ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDZ proteins","PDZ domain proteins","critical binding function of PDZ domains","cell polarity","cell junctions","cell migration","partner proteins","interactions critical","protein interaction domains","small modular domain","small globular protein","ligand interactions","binding partners","Recent data","development of small molecular inhibitors","biophysical data","prototypical ligand","Recent findings","cellular trafficking","surface retention of various ion channels","C-terminus","central role","cytoskeletal dynamics","\u03B1-helical","therapeutic agents","potential targets","dysfunction","disks-large","wealth of structural","yeast","phosphorylation","physical features","Post-synaptic density","\u03B2-strand structure","multiple disease states","memory","zonula","phosphatidylinositides","cholesterol","addition","important biological roles","amino acids","internal peptide sequences","studies","learning","humans"],"language":"en"},

Methods From a territory-wide database in Hong Kong, we included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents in the years between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and assigned as having poor (Proportion of Days Covered [PDC]\u003C40%), intermediate (40\u201379%), and high (\u226580%) adherence to antihypertensive agents. The association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated by using the Cox proportional hazard models. Results From a total of 218,047 eligible patients, 3825 patients (1.75%) died of cardiovascular disease within five years after having received their first-ever antihypertensive agents.

Genetically similar strains have also been reported from other mammals, which reveals their wide host distribution. The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the occurrence and genetic diversity of MRVs in bats in Slovenia, from samples obtained throughout the country in 2008 to 2010, and in 2012 and to investigate the occurrence of the novel SI-MRV01 MRV variant in Slovenian bats. RESULTS: The detection of MRVs in bat guano was based on broad-range RT-PCR and specific bat MRV real-time RT-PCR. Subsequently, MRV isolates were obtained from cell culture propagation, with detailed molecular characterisation through whole-genome sequencing. Overall, bat MRVs were detected in 1.9% to 3.8% of bats in 2008, 2009 and 2012. However, in 2010 the prevalence was 33.0%, which defined an outbreak of the single SI-MRV01 strain. Here, we report on the identification of five MRV isolates of different serotypes that are designated as SI-MRV02, SI-MRV03, SI-MRV04, SI-MRV05 and SI-MRV06. There is high genetic variability between these characterised isolates, with evident genome reassortment seen across their genome segments. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have confirmed the presence of the SI-MRV01 strain in a Slovenian bat population. Moreover, according to genetic characterisation of S1 genome segment, all three MRV serotypes were present in the bat population. In this study, five independent MRV isolates were obtained and detailed whole genome analysis revealed high diversity between them. This study generates new information about the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of emerging bat MRV variants, and provides important molecular data for further studies of their pathogenesis and evolution.

The potential for cyclophilins to serve as a drug target for antiviral therapy is evidenced by the success of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors (CPIs), including Alisporivir, in clinical trials targeting hepatitis C virus infection. In addition, as cyclophilins are implicated in the predisposition to, or severity of, various diseases, the ability to specifically and effectively modulate their function will prove increasingly useful for disease intervention. In this review, we will summarize the evidence of cyclophilins as key mediators of viral infection and prospective drug targets.","publish_time":"2013-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frausto, Stephen D.; Lee, Emily; Tang, Hengli","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/860ddc48c73d4757ceb161a9b43e73138b6b94a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3738956.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23852270/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v5071684","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evidence of cyclophilins","varied roles of cyclophilins","Mounting evidence","prospective drug targets","key mediators of viral infection","hepatitis C virus infection","trans isomerases important","clinical trials","prolyl cis","success of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors","CPIs","Alisporivir","proper folding of certain proteins","life cycles of diverse viruses","nature","antiviral therapy","various diseases","severity","mechanisms","disease intervention","function","ability","predisposition","review","potential","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study explored the epidemiological characteristics and molecular evolution of HBoV-1 in southeastern China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infections. HBoV-1 was detected using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and further characterized by complete genome sequences analysis. Among the 3,022 recruited children, 386 (12.77 %) were HBoV-1-positive and 300 (77.72 %) had co-detection with other respiratory viruses. Seasonal prevalence peaked in summer. HBoV-1 presence was significantly associated with asthma attack [odds ratio = 1.74; 95 % confidence interval: 1.30, 2.31; p \u003C 0.001]. Similar results were obtained when either single detection or co-detection of HBoV-1 was considered, demonstrating the minor impact of co-detection on the clinical characteristics or epidemic pattern. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome sequences showed that all the HBoV-1 sequences clustered together and no branch was formed that was supported by bootstrap value \u2265750. The overall evolutionary rate of the complete genome of HBoV-1 was estimated at 1.08 \u00D7 10(\u22124) nucleotide substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) [95 % highest probability density: (0.40\u20131.86) \u00D7 10(\u22124) s/s/y]. Selective pressure analysis showed that all the \u03C9-values were less than 1, suggesting that HBoV-1 was under negative selective pressure. Site-by-site analysis identified the codon site 40 of the VP1 gene under positive selection. In conclusion, our study disclosed the epidemiological and genetic dynamics of HBoV-1 epidemics in southeastern China in the most recent 3 years, the information of which might help to further improve our understanding of HBoV-1 infection and guide better surveillance and control strategies in the future.

In South Korea, a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system is lacking due to limited resources. We developed a simplified ECMO transport system without mechanical ventilation for use by public emergency medical services. METHODS: Eighteen patients utilized our ECMO transport system from December 2011 to September 2015. We retrospectively analyzed the indications for ECMO, the patient status during transport, and the patient outcomes. RESULTS: All transport was conducted on the ground by ambulance. The distances covered ranged from 26 to 408 km (mean, 65.9\u00B188.1 km) and the average transport time was 56.1\u00B157.3 minutes (range, 30 to 280 minutes). All patients were transported without adverse events. After transport, 4 patients (22.2%) underwent lung transplantation because of interstitial lung disease. Eight patients who had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome showed recovery of heart and lung function after ECMO therapy. A total of 13 patients (70.6%) were successfully taken off ECMO, and 11 patients (61.1%) survived. CONCLUSION: Our ECMO transport system without mechanical ventilation can be considered a safe and useful method for interhospital transport and could be a good alternative option for ECMO transport in Korean hospitals with limited resources.","publish_time":"2017-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeo, Hye Ju; Cho, Woo Hyun; Park, Jong Myung; Kim, Dohyung","journal":"Korean J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31db09417c093cb1d87d4dfbbc2bef73716194e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5295477.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5090/kjtcs.2017.50.1.8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28180097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["simplified ECMO transport system","well-established ECMO interhospital transport system","ECMO therapy","average transport time","ill patients","mechanical ventilation","lung function","lung transplantation","interhospital transportation","limited resources","minutes","interstitial lung disease","patient status","useful method","patient outcomes","recovery of heart","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","Korean hospitals","good alternative option","public emergency medical services","South Korea","BACKGROUND","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","indications","CONCLUSION","range","adverse events","METHODS","ambulance","total","RESULTS","distances","mean"],"language":"en"},

The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: \u201COn average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?\u201D Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacob, Louis; Smith, Lee; Butler, Laurie; Barnett, Yvonne; Grabovac, Igor; McDermott, Daragh; Armstrong, Nicola; Yakundi, Annita; Tully, Mark","journal":"J Sex Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9175525932d3bb364f5a9ff269a001114bf58e59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221385.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743609520306081?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411271/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743609520306081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["correlates of sexual activity","prevalence of sexual activity","trajectories of sexual activity","sexual activity weekly","low levels of sexual activity","lowest levels of sexual activity","self-isolation guidance","self-reporting bias","positive sexual health messages","UK adults self-isolating owing","UK COVID","current pandemic","current alcohol consumption","number of chronic physical conditions","UK government","UK public","higher number of days","number of chronic psychiatric conditions","current smoking status","sample","consuming alcohol","clinical data","older adults","social distancing","cross-sectional epidemiological study","detrimental health consequences","marital status","physical symptom","independent variables","younger age","CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS","pre-planned interim analyses of data","region","annual household income","employment","females","paper","risk of transmission","average","relation","times","factors","wellbeing","following question","multivariable logistic regression model","SARS-Cov","METHODS","association","Interventions","domestic partnership","findings","influence","population","online survey","individuals","LIMITATIONS","CONCLUSION","AIM","Participants","OUTCOMES","RESULTS","STRENGTH","women","BACKGROUND","years"],"language":"en"},

Despite the number of the studies reported to date, the causative agents of pneumonia are not completely known. Herein, we found by molecular technique that vegetable and tobacco DNA may be detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we studied bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients admitted to ICUs with ventilator-associated pneumonia. BAL fluids were assessed with molecular tests, culture and blood culture. We successfully identified plant DNA in six patients out of 106 (6%) with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Inhalation was confirmed in four cases and suspected in the other two cases. Inhalation was significantly frequent in patients with plant DNA (four out of six patients) than those without plant DNA (three out of 100 patients) (P\u003C0.001). Nicotiana tabacum chloroplast DNA was identified in three patients who were smokers (cases 2, 3 and 6). Cucurbita pepo, Morus bombycis and Triticum aestivum DNA were identified in cases 1, 4 and 5 respectively. Twenty-three different bacterial species, two viruses and five fungal species were identified from among these six patients by using molecular and culture techniques. Several of the pathogenic microorganisms identified are reported to be food-borne or tobacco plant-associated pathogens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows that plants DNA may be identified in the BAL fluid of pneumonia patients, especially when exploring aspiration pneumonia, but the significance of the presence of plant DNA and its role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia is unknown and remains to be investigated. However, the identification of these plants may be a potential marker of aspiration in patients with pneumonia.","publish_time":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bousbia, Sabri; Papazian, Laurent; La Scola, Bernard; Raoult, Didier","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e4f6e2dd8f847c11cc774c7083aa426f42a530e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2891989.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20585574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nicotiana","Cucurbita"],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized patients","BAL fluid of pneumonia patients","aspiration pneumonia","ventilator-associated pneumonia","tobacco DNA","plants DNA","nosocomial pneumonia","pathogenesis of pneumonia","presence of plant DNA","cases","causative agents of pneumonia","Triticum aestivum DNA","tobacco plant-associated pathogens","Nicotiana tabacum chloroplast DNA","molecular tests","bronchoalveolar lavage","molecular technique","SIGNIFICANCE","ICUs","blood culture","culture techniques","BAL fluids","Inhalation","present study","fungal species","potential marker of aspiration","different bacterial species","Morus bombycis","serious cause of mortality","viruses","date","role","Cucurbita pepo","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","infections","vegetable","studies","intensive care units","food","VAP","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","number","CONCLUSIONS","smokers","pathogenic microorganisms","identification"],"language":"en"},

Abstract We are facing a pandemic that is going to affect a significant part of the population. At the end of April in the world there are about 3,000,000 cases, with 205,000 deaths and 860,000 patients recovered. The response to this pandemic has in many cases led to a significant change in the daily work of caring for cancer patients, the good results of which depend largely on time-adjusted protocols and multidisciplinary treatments. We present a review of local, surgical and radiotherapy treatment together with authors\u0027 recommendations made from personal experience on ways to act in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multidisciplinary Breast Committees must continue to meet weekly in videoconference format. All surgical actions and irradiations must be carried out with maximum safety for both the patients and the participating teams. Hypofractionation in radiation therapy should be the standard treatment. Sometimes it is recommended to apply a primary systemic treatment or even a primary irradiation.

Objective We sought to investigate the possible association between neonatal lung function and biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Methods Plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, and CXCL8 (IL-8) were measured at age 6 months in 300 children of the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood2000 birth cohort who had completed neonatal lung function testing at age 4 weeks. Associations between neonatal lung function indices and inflammatory biomarkers were investigated by conventional statistics and unsupervised principal component analysis. Results The neonatal forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds was inversely associated with hs-CRP (\u03B2-coefficient, \u22120.12; 95% CI, \u22120.21 to \u22120.04; P \u003C .01) and IL-6 (\u03B2-coefficient, \u22120.10; 95% CI, \u22120.18 to \u22120.01; P = .03) levels. The multivariate principal component analysis approach, including hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, and CXCL8, confirmed a uniform upregulated inflammatory profile in children with reduced forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (P = .02). Adjusting for body mass index at birth, maternal smoking, older children in the home, neonatal bacterial airway colonization, infections 14 days before, and asthmatic symptoms, as well as virus-induced wheezing, at any time before biomarker assessment at age 6 months did not affect the associations. Conclusion Diminished neonatal lung function is associated with upregulated systemic inflammatory markers, such as hs-CRP.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chawes, Bo L.K.; Stokholm, Jakob; B\u00F8nnelykke, Klaus; Brix, Susanne; Bisgaard, Hans","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f25f4afe5c2d61dca441bb89903245c6765af656.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173110.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25579483/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2014.11.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674914016741; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674914016741","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neonatal lung function indices","neonatal lung function testing","reduced lung function","impaired lung function","hs-CRP","neonatal forced expiratory volume","biomarkers of systemic inflammation","low-grade systemic inflammation","low-grade inflammation","inflammatory biomarkers","older children","Background Children","\u03B2-coefficient","neonatal bacterial airway colonization","upregulated systemic inflammatory markers","reduced forced expiratory volume","seconds","CXCL8","TNF-\u03B1","months","Associations","uniform upregulated inflammatory profile","unsupervised principal component analysis","multivariate principal component analysis approach","asthmatic symptoms","Childhood2000 birth cohort","Methods Plasma levels of high","maternal smoking","home","conventional statistics","asymptomatic neonates","sensitivity C-reactive protein","Copenhagen Prospective Study","days","infections","adults","time","possible association","body mass index","biomarker assessment","weeks","virus-induced wheezing","Conclusion","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Treatment options for these bacteria are generally limited, less effective and more expensive. The emergence and dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria circulating between animals, the environment and humans are not entirely known. Nonetheless, selective pressure by antibiotics on the microbiomes of animal and human, and their associated environments (especially farms and healthcare institutions), sewage systems and soil are likely to confer survival advantages upon bacteria with antimicrobial-resistance genes, which may be further disseminated through plasmids or transposons with integrons. Therefore, antibiotic use must be tightly regulated to eliminate such selective pressure, including the illegalization of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed and regulation of antibiotic use in veterinary practice and human medicine. Heightened awareness of infection control measures to reduce the risk of acquiring resistant bacteria is essential, especially during antimicrobial use or institutionalization in healthcare facilities. The transmission cycle must be interrupted by proper hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, avoidance of undercooked or raw food and compliance with infection control measures by healthcare workers, visitors and patients, especially during treatment with antibiotics. In addition to these routine measures, proactive microbiological screening of hospitalized patients with risk factors for carrying resistant bacteria, including history of travel to endemic countries, transfer from other hospitals, and prolonged hospitalization; directly observed hand hygiene before oral intake of drugs, food and drinks; and targeted disinfection of high-touch or mutual-touch items, such as bed rails and bed curtains, are important. Transparency of surveillance data from each institute for public scrutiny provides an incentive for controlling antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings at an administrative level.","publish_time":"2015-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Vincent CC; Wong, Sally CY; Ho, Pak-Leung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3be2b917c48e3dc25a4e6bb3028fd5d32e4f2d9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4345289.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038766/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2015.8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria","antimicrobial use","antimicrobial-resistance genes","dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes","healthcare institutions","healthcare workers","healthcare settings","healthcare facilities","routine measures","regulation of antibiotic use","illegalization of antibiotics","selective pressure","Heightened awareness of infection control measures","proper hand hygiene","raw food","risk factors","animal feed","microbiomes of animal","bed rails","bed curtains","human medicine","Treatment options","mutual-touch items","proactive microbiological screening of hospitalized patients","compliance","environmental cleaning","avoidance of undercooked","institute","soil","drinks","growth promoters","veterinary practice","incentive","visitors","targeted disinfection of high","oral intake of drugs","sewage systems","history of travel","survival advantages","hospitals","transfer","endemic countries","public scrutiny","farms","associated environments","animals","prolonged hospitalization","Transparency of surveillance data","emergence","institutionalization","administrative level","Hong Kong","addition","transmission cycle","plasmids","transposons","integrons","China","humans"],"language":"en"},

Their expression is upregulated following stress and viral infection, and they associate with the SRP9/14 protein dimer in the cytoplasm forming Alu RNPs. Using cell-free translation, we have previously shown that Alu RNPs inhibit polysome formation. Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14. Alu RNPs also inhibit the translation of cellular mRNAs resuming translation after stress and of viral mRNAs suggesting a role of Alu RNPs in adapting the translational output in response to stress and viral infection.","publish_time":"2015-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ivanova, Elena; Berger, Audrey; Scherrer, Anne; Alkalaeva, Elena; Strub, Katharina","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9a33f1d0a7dee1c6fb63346baa0d6565fc79c00.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eb5476698f1fd39bed192f7ec8211953f78537b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4357698.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25697503/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Alu RNAs","Alu elements","role of Alu RNPs","overexpression of Alu RNA","S subunits","translation of cellular mRNAs","viral mRNAs","mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation","translation of reporter mRNAs","S ribosomal subunits","viral infection","viral RNAs","cell-free translation","S complex formation","direct binding of SRP9","following stress","RNA polymerase","effect","IRES-mediated initiation","polysome formation","translational output","continuous association","assembly factor","response","protein dimer","recruitment of mRNA","cytoplasm","cap-dependent","mutation","cells","human genome","affinity"],"language":"en"},

The most common enteric viruses affecting commercial flocks in Brazil include Fowl Adenovirus of group I (FAdV-I), Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV), Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV), Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV), Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Avian Reovirus (AReo), and Avian Rotavirus (ARtV). The aim of this study was to identify single and multiple infections using data obtained from 270 samples from eleven Brazilian states, corresponding to the period between 2010 and 2017. This was accompanied by an analysis of the relationship between the age of birds, clinical signs, and geographical distribution, using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) techniques. Twenty-five profiles of virus combinations were detected. Single infections were encountered in 86.3% of samples, and multiple infections were present in the remaining 13.7%. Both single and multiple infections affected all kinds of commercial chickens with digestive problems, stunting syndrome, decreases in egg and meat production, increased mortality, and respiratory signs. FAdV-I, ChPV, CAstV, ANV, and ARtV were mostly detected in young broilers, in contrast with IBV, which was detected in hens from one to greater than 51 weeks of age. These results exhibit the complexity of enteric diseases and the still poorly understood role of each pathogen as a unique etiological agent.","publish_time":"2018-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"De la Torre, David I.; Nu\u00F1ez, Luis F.; Astolfi-Ferreira, Claudete S.; Piantino Ferreira, Antonio J.","journal":"Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36c6a493ce71b4e2df91b9b486cc847833a4ed25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6024555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29596389/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci5020038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Avian Reovirus"],"organizations":["Fowl Adenovirus"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["multiple infections","Single infections","Avian Nephritis Virus","RT-PCR","IBV","Avian Reovirus","CAstV","Avian Rotavirus","ANV","common enteric viruses","ChPV","FAdV","samples","ARtV","Reverse Transcription-PCR","Infectious Bronchitis Virus","complexity of enteric diseases","profiles of virus combinations","commercial flocks","important role","Chicken Astrovirus","Chicken Parvovirus","understood role","clinical signs","young broilers","respiratory signs","age of birds","Brazilian states","weeks of age","kinds of commercial chickens","Brazilian poultry industry","low yields of broilers","geographical distribution","egg","stunting syndrome","increased mortality","economic impact","digestive problems","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Fowl Adenovirus of group","meat production","pathogen","AReo","layers","data","unique etiological agent","relationship","results","contrast","study","techniques","analysis","period","hens","breeders","aim"],"language":"en"},

More recently, a concept that has been increasingly emphasized in many studies is that for many infectious diseases, transmission is not homogeneous but highly skewed at the level of populations. In what became known as the \u201820/80 rule\u2019, about 20% of the hosts in a population were found to contribute to about 80% of the transmission potential. These heterogeneities have been described for the interaction between many microorganisms and their human or animal hosts. Several epidemiological studies have reported transmission heterogeneities for Escherichia coli by cattle, a phenomenon with far-reaching agricultural, medical and public health implications. Focusing on E. coli as a case study, this paper will describe super-spreading and super-shedding by cattle, review the main factors that shape these transmission heterogeneities and examine the interface with human health. Escherichia coli super-shedding and super-spreading by cattle are shaped by microorganism-specific, cattle-specific and environmental factors. Understanding the factors that shape heterogeneities in E. coli dispersion by cattle and the implications for human health represent key components that are critical for targeted infection control initiatives.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stein, Richard A.; Katz, David E.","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/286a97bffa060b684330c1db70b1432724e745c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333229/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnx050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission heterogeneities","cattle-specific","super-spreading","Escherichia coli super-shedding","human health","coli dispersion","transmission potential","public health implications","main factors","environmental factors","microorganism-specific","pathogen interaction","individual host","epidemiological studies","animal hosts","key components","phenomenon","paper","targeted infection control initiatives","likelihood","early models","infectious diseases","microorganisms","interface","case study","level of populations","rule","concept"],"language":"en"},

Methods Refractory patients were defined as cases showing clinical and radiological deterioration despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7 days or more. We identified 6 such children (male/female: 3/3) aged 3\u20139 years who were treated between 1998 and 2006. During the same period, 190 children with MP were admitted to our institution. Results Common laboratory findings of the patients included cytopenia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, and elevated urine \u03B22-microglobulin levels, suggesting complication of hypercytokinemic condition. We initiated intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 30mg/kg on 10.2\u00B12.8 clinical days and administered it once daily for 3 consecutive days. Fever subsided 4\u201314h after initiation of steroid pulse therapy in all patients. This dramatic effect was accompanied by rapid improvement of radiological abnormalities including infiltrates and pleural effusion, followed by improvement of laboratory abnormalities. There were no adverse events of steroid therapy. Conclusions This is the first case-series study showing an effect of 3-day methylprednisolone pulse therapy on refractory MP in children. This therapy is apparently an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for refractory MP.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tamura, Akihiro; Matsubara, Kousaku; Tanaka, Takayuki; Nigami, Hiroyuki; Yura, Kazuo; Fukaya, Takashi","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11573d3bd32381c341555e51b00b7d39c5104439.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112643.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2008.06.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016344530800217X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18656264/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016344530800217X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["refractory MP","children","efficacy of methylprednisolone pulse therapy","day methylprednisolone pulse therapy","initiation of steroid pulse therapy","appropriate antibiotic therapy","Methods Refractory patients","adverse events of steroid therapy","clinical days","improvement of laboratory abnormalities","intravenous methylprednisolone","antibiotic treatment","consecutive days","rapid improvement of radiological abnormalities","ferritin levels","radiological deterioration","dramatic effect","elevated urine \u03B22-microglobulin levels","well-tolerated treatment","Common laboratory findings","elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase","cytopenia","Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia","infiltrates","cases","pleural effusion","complication of hypercytokinemic condition","case-series study","Summary Objectives","dose","female","period","Conclusions","Fever","institution","years"],"language":"en"},

To study this difference in CD13 surface expression, specific CD13 mRNA from 44 individuals were quantified by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Absolute values for CD13 transcripts were normalised against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript levels to control for variations in sample preparation and mRNA degradation.

Treatment options remain limited due to the lack of antivirals. Octaguanidinium-conjugated morpholino oligomers (vivo-MOs) are single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents that can readily penetrate cells and reduce gene expression by steric blocking of complementary RNA sequences. In this study, inhibitory effects of three vivo-MOs that are complementary to the EV-71 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) were tested in RD cells. Vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 targeting the EV-71 IRES showed significant viral plaque reductions of 2.5 and 3.5 log10PFU/ml, respectively. Both vivo-MOs reduced viral RNA copies and viral capsid expression in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, vivo-MO-3 targeting the EV-71 RdRP exhibited less antiviral activity. Both vivo-MO-1 and 2 remained active when administered either 4h before or within 6h after EV-71 infection. Vivo-MO-2 exhibited antiviral activities against poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus A16 but vivo-MO-1 showed no antiviral activities against PV. Both the IRES-targeting vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 inhibit EV-71 RNA translation. Resistant mutants arose after serial passages in the presence of vivo-MO-1, but none were isolated against vivo-MO-2. A single T to C substitution at nucleotide position 533 was sufficient to confer resistance to vivo-MO-1. Our findings suggest that IRES-targeting vivo-MOs are good antiviral candidates for treating early EV-71 infection, and vivo-MO-2 is a more favorable candidate with broader antiviral spectrum against enteroviruses and are refractory to antiviral resistance.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Chee Wah; Chan, Yoke Fun; Quah, Yi Wan; Poh, Chit Laa","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/012d67a440ec30896e8c89c67a736c2638512be1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118997.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.04.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214001107; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214001107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRES","PV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MOs","early EV","antiviral activities","antiviral resistance","IRES","antiviral activity","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","viral RNA copies","RNA translation","broader antiviral spectrum","good antiviral candidates","RD cells","viral capsid expression","steric blocking of complementary RNA sequences","RdRP","PV","gene expression","significant viral plaque reductions","single T","single-stranded DNA","dose-dependent manner","enteroviruses","nucleotide position","C substitution","internal ribosome entry site","mild hand","severe neurological complications","high mortality rates","favorable candidate","poliovirus","antisense agents","serial passages","foot","mouth disease","coxsackievirus A16","Octaguanidinium-conjugated morpholino oligomers","Resistant mutants","inhibitory effects","infections","presence","Treatment options","lack of antivirals","study","log10PFU","Abstract Enterovirus","findings","contrast"],"language":"en"},

DpCPV has a genome consisting of 10 linear double-stranded RNA segments. To establish a reverse genetics system, we cloned cDNAs encoding the 10 genomic segments of DpCPV into three reverse genetics vectors in which each segment was transcribed under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and terminator tagged with a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence. We also constructed a vp80-knockout Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus bacmid to express a T7 RNA polymerase codon-optimized for Sf9 cells. Following transfection of Sf9 cells with the three vectors and the bacmid, occlusion bodies (OBs) with the typical morphology of cypovirus polyhedra were observed by optical microscopy. The rescue system was verified by incorporation of a HindIII restriction enzyme site null mutant of the 9th genomic segment. Furthermore, when we co-transfected Sf9 cells with the reverse genetics vectors, the bacmid, and an additional vector bearing an egfp gene flanked with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions of the 10th genomic segment, aggregated green fluorescence co-localizing with the OBs was observed. The rescued OBs were able to infect Spodopetra exigua larvae, although their infectivity was significantly lower than that of wild-type DpCPV.

We present two other crystal structures, the inhibitor Sinefungin bound in the S-adenosylmethionine binding pocket and the tighter complex nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16, providing the first structural insight into the regulation of RNA capping enzymes in (\u002B)RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2011-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Decroly, Etienne; Debarnot, Claire; Ferron, Fran\u00E7ois; Bouvet, Mickael; Coutard, Bruno; Imbert, Isabelle; Gluais, Laure; Papageorgiou, Nicolas; Sharff, Andrew; Bricogne, G\u00E9rard; Ortiz-Lombardia, Miguel; Lescar, Julien; Canard, Bruno","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e65736745475f7a3bab0f310edb593acc50528b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3102710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637813/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp16 association","tighter complex nsp10","nsp16 complex structure","activating partner nsp10","RNA binding","viral S-adenosylmethionine","S-adenosylmethionine binding pocket","RNA viruses","regulation of RNA capping enzymes","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus nsp16 protein","dependent methyltransferases","mRNA capping","\u00C5 resolution","detoxification","chromatin remodeling","nucleic acid processing","signal transduction","key residues","metabolism","presence","regulated processes","inhibitor Sinefungin","structural insight","nucleoside","Y96F","Functional assays","crystal structures","catalysis","surface area","SN2","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are no licensed vaccines available for hPIV, RSV and coronaviruses, and the available seasonal influenza vaccines have considerable limitations. With regard to pandemic preparedness, it is important that procedures are in place to respond rapidly and produce tailor made vaccines against these respiratory viruses on short notice. Moreover, especially for influenza there is great need for the development of a universal vaccine that induces broad protective immunity against influenza viruses of various subtypes. Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) is a replication-deficient viral vector that holds great promise as a vaccine platform. MVA can encode one or more foreign antigens and thus functions as a multivalent vaccine. The vector can be used at biosafety level 1, has intrinsic adjuvant capacities and induces humoral and cellular immune responses. However, there are some practical and regulatory issues that need to be addressed in order to develop MVA-based vaccines on short notice at the verge of a pandemic. In this review, we discuss promising novel influenza virus vaccine targets and the use of MVA for vaccine development against various respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2014-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Altenburg, Arwen F.; Kreijtz, Joost H.

Meta-transcriptomics provides insights into disease etiology by cataloguing and comparing sequences from suspected pathogens. This method is a powerful approach to simultaneously evaluate both the viral and bacterial communities, but few studies have applied this technique in marine systems. In 2009 seven harbor seals, Phoca vitulina, stranded along the California coast from a similar brain disease of unknown cause of death (UCD). We evaluated the differences between the virome and microbiome of UCDs and harbor seals with known causes of death. Here we determined that UCD stranded animals had no viruses in their brain tissue. However, in the bacterial community, we identified Burkholderia and Coxiella burnetii as important pathogens associated with this stranding event. Burkholderia were 100% prevalent and ~2.8 log2 fold more abundant in the UCD animals. Further, while C. burnetii was found in only 35.7% of all samples, it was highly abundant (~94% of the total microbial community) in a single individual. In this harbor seal, C. burnetii showed high transcription rates of invading and translation genes, implicating it in the pathogenesis of this animal. Based on these data we propose that Burkholderia taxa and C. burnetii are potentially important opportunistic neurotropic pathogens in UCD stranded harbor seals.","publish_time":"2015-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosales, Stephanie M.; Vega Thurber, Rebecca","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fddf78a6b3a823c0ebeb2dfbfe274e46fee97f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4668051.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26630132/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143944","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxiella"],"organizations":["Meta-transcriptomics","UCD"],"locations":["California"],"keyphrases":["UCD stranded harbor seals","important pathogens","UCD animals","UCD stranded animals","suspected pathogens","Coxiella burnetii","important opportunistic neurotropic pathogens","disease etiology","disease reservoirs","Burkholderia taxa","bacterial community","similar brain disease of unknown cause of death","brain tissue","bacterial communities","marine systems","Marine diseases","known causes of death","total microbial community","high transcription rates of invading","California coast","microbiome of UCDs","translation genes","viruses","log2 fold","Phoca vitulina","Meta-transcriptomics","insights","studies","virome","sequences","tools","single individual","technique","stranding event","powerful approach","method","pathogenesis","differences","data","samples","epizootics"],"language":"en"},

Although some diseases have increased as the climate has warmed, evidence for widespread climate-driven disease expansion has not materialized, despite increased research attention. Biological responses to warming depend on the non-linear relationships between physiological performance and temperature, called the thermal response curve. This leads performance to rise and fall with temperature. Under climate change, host species and their associated parasites face extinction if they cannot either thermoregulate or adapt by shifting phenology or geographic range. Climate change might also affect disease transmission through increases or decreases in host susceptibility and infective stage (and vector) production, longevity, and pathology. Many other factors drive disease transmission, especially economics, and some change in time along with temperature, making it hard to distinguish whether temperature drives disease or just correlates with disease drivers. Although it is difficult to predict how climate change will affect infectious disease, an ecological approach can help meet the challenge.","publish_time":"2016-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lafferty, Kevin D.; Mordecai, Erin A.","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a32e94a4c479957e6c98108ac3eaa344bc07f7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4995683.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.8766.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27610227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["climate change","disease transmission","temperature drives disease","disease drivers","widespread climate-driven disease expansion","infectious diseases","increased research attention","host species","host susceptibility","risk of malaria","physiological performance","associated parasites face extinction","production","vector","infective stage","economics","evidence","non-linear relationships","number of people","ecological approach","increases","thermal response curve","phenology","longevity","thermoregulate","factors","time","outdated estimates","geographic range","pathology","challenge","Biological responses"],"language":"en"},

However, the temporal relationship of detecting virus-laden particles at nonhealthcare locations vs surveillance data obtained by conventional means has not been fully assessed. METHODS: From October 2016 to June 2018, air was sampled weekly from a university campus in Hong Kong. Viral genomes were detected and quantified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of ecological and environmental factors associated with the detection of virus-laden airborne particles. RESULTS: Influenza A (16.9% [117/694]) and influenza B (4.5% [31/694]) viruses were detected at higher frequencies in air than rhinovirus (2.2% [6/270]), respiratory syncytial virus (0.4% [1/270]), or human coronaviruses (0% [0/270]).

Atopy is an important risk factor for asthma persistence. Objective We sought to evaluate whether atopy is a risk factor for prolonged AHR after upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Methods Twenty-five children (13 atopic and 12 nonatopic children) with intermittent virus-induced asthma were studied. Clinical evaluation, skin prick tests, methacholine bronchoprovocation, questionnaires, and a nasal wash specimen were obtained at baseline. For 9 months, subjects completed diary cards with respiratory symptoms. During their first reported cold, a nasal wash specimen was obtained. Methacholine provocation was performed 10 days and 5, 7, 9, and 11 weeks later. In case a new cold developed, the provocation schedule was followed from the beginning. Results Viruses were detected in 17 (68%) of 25 patients during their first cold, with rhinovirus being most commonly identified (82%). AHR increased significantly 10 days after the URI, equally in both groups (P =.67), and remained so up to the fifth week. Duration of AHR in subjects experiencing a single URI ranged from 5 to 11 weeks, without a significant difference between groups. In the duration of the study, atopic children experienced more colds and asthma exacerbations than nonatopic children. Thus for duration of AHR, significant prolongation was noted in the atopic group when assessed cumulatively. Conclusion In asthmatic children the duration of AHR after a single natural cold is 5 to 11 weeks. However, an increased rate of symptomatic cold and asthma episodes in atopic children is associated with considerable cumulative prolongation of AHR, which might help explain the role of atopy as a risk factor for asthma persistence.","publish_time":"2005-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.; Bossios, Apostolos; Manoussakis, Emmanuel; Manousakas, Theodoros; Saxoni-Papageorgiou, Photini","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d340108379459c777ab70dd7483ab6135c8281f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172284.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009167490500713X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009167490500713X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Duration of AHR","asthma exacerbations","nonatopic children","asthma persistence","prolonged AHR","asthma episodes","asthmatic children","weeks","considerable cumulative prolongation of AHR","single natural cold","atopic group","important risk factor","intermittent virus-induced asthma","increased rate of symptomatic cold","respiratory symptoms","Background Respiratory viruses","subjects","nasal wash specimen","significant prolongation","Methacholine provocation","role of atopy","single URI","groups","days","upper respiratory tract infections","methacholine bronchoprovocation","provocation schedule","significant difference","Results Viruses","questionnaires","skin prick tests","colds","airway hyperresponsiveness","diary cards","Clinical evaluation","URIs","study","months","case","baseline","Conclusion","beginning","Methods","Objective","patients","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Tropical Africa is not the only area where deadly viruses have recently emerged. In South-East Asia severe epidemics of dengue hemorrhagic fever started in 1954 and flu pandemics have originated from China such as the Asian flu (H2N2) in 1957, the Hong-Kong flu (H3N2) in 1968, and the Russian flu (H1N1) in 1977. However, it is especially during the last ten years that very dangerous viruses for mankind have repeatedly developed in Asia, with the occurrence of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever in Saudi Arabia (1995), avian flu (H5N1) in Hong-Kong (1997), Nipah virus encephalitis in Malaysia (1998,) and, above all, the SARS pandemic fever from Southern China (2002). The evolution of these viral diseases was probably not directly affected by climate change. In fact, their emergential success may be better explained by the development of large industry poultry flocks increasing the risks of epizootics, dietary habits, economic and demographic constraints, and negligence in the surveillance and reporting of the first cases.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chastel, C.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd68e3ffd7af67cd9ebfd0453fec1390107b4bdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131654.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X04001805; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X04001805","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chine","Philippines","Hong-Kong","Arabie Saoudite","Malaisie","China","Asia","Saudi Arabia","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["the development","The evolution","negligence in the surveillance","in Hong-Kong","the Hong-Kong flu","the Russian flu","In fact","with the occurrence","the first cases","such as the Asian flu","grippe de Hong","dengue hemorrhagic fever started in","Nipah virus encephalitis in Malaysia","repeatedly developed in Asia","it is especially during the","the SARS pandemic fever from Southern","Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever in Saudi Arabia","the only area where deadly viruses","flu pandemics","avian flu","virus Alkhurma","virus Nipah","grippe asiatique","In South-East Asia severe epidemics","large industry poultry flocks increasing the risks","virus dangereux","grippe russe","grippe aviaire H5N1","dengue h\u00E9morragique","H3N2","H1N1","Chine du sud","originated from","surveillance \u00E9pid\u00E9miologique","facteurs humains","facteurs climatiques","apparition de la fi\u00E8vre h\u00E9morragique","Abstract Tropical Africa is","\u00E9mergence de viroses humaines graves","ten years that very dangerous viruses","their emergential success may be better explained","mankind","these viral diseases was probably","epizootics","directly affected","H2N2","dietary habits","demographic constraints","reporting","\u00E9levages industriels","risques","animaux de basse cour","economic","habitudes alimentaires","recently emerged","pressions \u00E9conomiques","\u00E9pizooties","d\u00E9veloppement","n\u00E9gligences","However","seule r\u00E9gion du monde","climate change","Arabie Saoudite","\u00E9mergences virales","r\u00F4le r\u00E9duit","succ\u00E8s \u00E9mergentiel","pand\u00E9mies grippales","above","N2H2","d\u00E9claration des premiers cas","Afrique tropicale","derni\u00E8res ann\u00E9es","homme","particulier","Philippines","enc\u00E9phalite","Malaisie","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","Asie","SRAS"],"language":"fr"},

Influenza has been reported from Indian Hajj and Umrah returning pilgrims, but data on other respiratory pathogens are sparse in India. Here we report the presence of common respiratory viral pathogens in returning Hajj and Umrah pilgrims suffering from acute respiratory illness (ARI) in 2014-2015. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were collected from 300 consenting pilgrims with ARI in the past one week and tested for influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses using in-house standardized quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical features among the pathogen positive and negative patients were compared. The patients received symptomatic treatment and antivirals where appropriate and were followed telephonically to collect data on illness outcome. RESULTS: Ninety seven (32.3%) of the 300 participants were tested positive for any virus, most common being influenza viruses (n=33, 11%). Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human coronaviruses [n=26, 8.7%; OC43 (n=19, 6.3%) and C229E (n=7, 2.3%)], rhinovirus (n=20, 6%), adenoviruses (n=8, 2.6%), parainfluenza viruses (n=7, 2.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (n=3, 1%) and bocaviruses (n=2, 0.6%). Clinical features observed in pathogen positive and pathogen negative patients did not differ significantly. Eighteen influenza positive patients were treated with oseltamivir. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: Pilgrims returning from mass gatherings are often afflicted with respiratory pathogens with a potential to facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens across international borders. The study reinforces the need for better infection prevention and control measures such as vaccination, health education on cough etiquette and hand hygiene.","publish_time":"2018-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koul, Parvaiz A.; Mir, Hyder; Saha, Siddhartha; Chadha, Mandeep S.; Potdar, Varsha; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Lal, Renu B.; Krishnan, Anand","journal":"Indian J Med Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6251276.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_890_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","respiratory infections","Respiratory specimens","transmission of respiratory pathogens","Respiratory tract infections","acute respiratory illness","respiratory syncytial virus","presence of common respiratory viral pathogens","Umrah pilgrims","influenza positive patients","pathogen positive","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","consenting pilgrims","pathogen negative patients","parainfluenza viruses","Indian Hajj","ARI","data","Clinical features","health education","illness outcome","public health risk","in-house standardized quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","control measures","vaccination","MERS-CoV","better infection prevention","cough etiquette","need","OBJECTIVES","potential","hand hygiene","throat swabs","mass gatherings","symptomatic treatment","antivirals","CONCLUSIONS","week","BACKGROUND","international borders","human coronaviruses","study","METHODS","oseltamivir","INTERPRETATION","participants","OC43","C229E","adenoviruses","bocaviruses","rhinovirus","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The present work was involved to explore the effect of siRNA targeting nsp1\u03B1 on the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells, and the results showed that over-expression of nsp1\u03B1 enhanced the replication of PRRSV and that siRNAs specifically targeting nsp1\u03B1 significantly inhibited the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells.

The 5\u2032-terminal sequences are identical to the leader sequences present at the 5\u2032-end of the subgenomic mRNAs. Two possible hairpin loop structures and an AU-rich region around the 3\u2032-end of the leader sequence may provide the termination site for leader RNA synthesis. The comparison of 5\u2032-end genomic sequences and the intergenic start sites for mRNA transcription revealed that there are homologous regions of 7\u201318 nucleotides at the putative leader/body junction sites. Some intergenic regions contain a mismatching nucleotide within this homologous region. We propose that free leader RNA binds to the intergenic region due to this homology and is cleaved at the mismatching nucleotide before serving as a primer. Thus, the free leader RNA species may be longer than the leader sequences in the subgenomic mRNAs and different mRNAs may have different leader/body junction sites.","publish_time":"1987-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shieh, Chien-Kou; Soe, Lisa H.; Making, Shinji; Chang, Ming-Fu; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682287904120; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287904120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different leader","putative leader","leader RNA synthesis","free leader RNA species","leader sequences present","end","precise mechanism of leader","genomic sequences","coronavirus leader-primed transcription model","transcription of subgenomic mRNAs","different mRNAs","intergenic regions","terminal sequences","mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA","intergenic start sites","body junction sites","mRNA transcription","mismatching nucleotide","primer","homologous regions","AU-rich region","termination site","nucleotides","possible hairpin loop structures","priming","homology","comparison"],"language":"en"},

Compared to alphaviruses, processing of RV glycoprotein moieties occurred relatively slowly and the transport of glycoproteins E2 and El to the plasma membrane was inefficient. Indirect immunofluoresence revealed that the majority of RV antigen in transfected and infected COS cells was localized to the Golgi region, including the capsid protein. Accumulation of capsid protein in the juxtanuclear region was determined to be RV glycoprotein dependent. Unlike alphaviruses, RV El did not require E2 for targeting to the Golgi where it was retained. E2 was however necessary for cell surface expression of Et. This study revealed that the processing and transport of RV structural proteins is quite different from alphaviruses and that the accumulation of antigens in the Golgi region may be significant in light of previous reports which suggest that RV buds from the internal membranes in some cell types.","publish_time":"1990-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hobman, Tom C.; Lundstrom, Marita L.; Gillam, Shirley","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7653f8fde9399fa144621ea0f073665bcb60fc84.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682290903855; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682290903855","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COS","RV El"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E2-Et","RV buds","transport of RV structural proteins","RV glycoprotein dependent","transport of glycoproteins E2","processing of RV glycoprotein moieties","structural proteins C-E2","majority of RV antigen","Golgi region","alphaviruses","cell surface expression of Et","juxtanuclear region","transient expression","Accumulation of capsid protein","intracellular transport","infected COS cells","accumulation of antigens","eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5","cell types","rubella virus","light of previous reports","internal membranes","Abstract Plasmids","cDNAs","plasma membrane","E1","Indirect immunofluoresence","study"],"language":"en"},

This deadly virus caused the world to be in high alert as the death toll and the number of confirmed cases is continuously rising since the first case was reported. The Chinese government warned that the transmission ability of the virus is increasing, and international efforts are needed to overcome this outbreak. The purpose of this review is to focus on the published articles about the new virus, which will give an insight into the current state of research and data available, as well as recommending future studies. METHODS: For this narrative review, more than 20 relevant scientific articles and reports were considered from various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct) using keywords such as Coronavirus Outbreak, COVID-19, Emerging Epidemics, Emerging Infections, and Novel Coronavirus. RESULTS: The results from this review show that the situation is rapidly evolving, as human-to-human transmission is occurring, and the number of new cases and mortalities is increasing by the day and on a global level. There is still ambiguity about mutation risks and how the virus spreads as the source was not yet identified. Major gaps in knowledge about the origin of the virus, epidemiology and transmission impose a great challenge, which emphasizes the need for further studies in the future.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"AlTakarli, Nourah S.","journal":"Dubai Medical Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/960ce652ea3f7fb9df40da78e21eb1efbdf577ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179703.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000506678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar","Science Direct","Emerging Epidemics, Emerging Infections","Novel Coronavirus"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["new virus","virus spreads","deadly virus","Coronavirus Outbreak","human transmission","COVID","Novel Coronavirus","transmission ability","coronavirus disease","pneumonia outbreak","number of new cases","narrative review","RESULTS","future studies","number of confirmed cases","Emerging Epidemics","Emerging Infections","Wuhan city","major transport","published articles","Major gaps","global level","relevant scientific articles","global public health concern","Google Scholar","China","keywords","Science Direct","death toll","current state of research","PubMed","reports","origin","epidemiology","data available","various databases","high alert","great challenge","need","world","mutation risks","insight","mortalities","knowledge","day","logistics hub","discovery","Chinese government","people","international efforts","ambiguity","METHODS","BACKGROUND","source","situation","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Novel reagents and streamlined protocols for rapidly assembling co-expression constructs for this purpose have been designed and validated. The high-throughput pipeline implemented at IGBMC Strasbourg and the ACEMBL platform at the EMBL Grenoble utilize recombinant overexpression systems for heterologous expression of proteins and their complexes. Extension of the ACEMBL platform technology to include eukaryotic hosts such as insect and mammalian cells has been achieved. Efficient production of large multicomponent protein complexes for structural studies using the baculovirus/insect cell system can be hampered by a stoichiometric imbalance of the subunits produced.

As of June 3, 2014, MERS CoV has reportedly infected 688 people and killed 282. We briefly summarize the state of the outbreak, and highlight unanswered questions and various explanations for the observed epidemiology. FINDINGS: The continuing but infrequent cases of MERS-CoV reported over the past two years have been puzzling and difficult to explain. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV, with many sporadic cases and a few hospital outbreaks, yet no sustained epidemic, suggests a low reproductive number. Furthermore, a clear source of infection to humans remains unknown. Also puzzling is the fact that MERS-CoV has been present in Saudi Arabia over several mass gatherings, including the 2012 and 2013 Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, which predispose to epidemics, without an epidemic arising. CONCLUSIONS: The observed epidemiology of MERS-CoV is quite distinct and does not clearly fit either a sporadic or epidemic pattern. Possible explanations of the unusual features of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV include sporadic ongoing infections from a non-human source; human to human transmission with a large proportion of undetected cases; or a combination of both. The virus has been identified in camels; however the mode of transmission of the virus to humans remains unknown, and many cases have no history of animal contact. In order to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of MERS CoV, further investigation is warranted.","publish_time":"2014-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gardner, Lauren M; MacIntyre, C Raina","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/153bc127b399f445ca2ec0e0709379efaada43bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4068970.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920393/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","epidemiology of MERS CoV","observed epidemiology of MERS","infrequent cases of MERS","sporadic cases","human transmission","non-human source","sustained epidemic","humans","epidemic pattern","epidemic arising","puzzling","large proportion of undetected cases","sporadic ongoing infections","mode of transmission","various explanations","Possible explanations","clear source of infection","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Arabian Peninsula","hospital outbreaks","unusual features","unanswered questions","current threat","better understanding","potential pandemic disease","BACKGROUND","epidemics","Saudi Arabia","low reproductive number","Umrah pilgrimages","mass gatherings","history of animal contact","FINDINGS","camels","years","people","CONCLUSIONS","fact","investigation","Hajj","order","combination","state"],"language":"en"},

They are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, a reduced quality of life and an increasing reliance on social care. ECOPD are common and are increasing in prevalence. Exacerbations beget exacerbations, with up to a quarter of in-patient episodes ending with readmission to hospital within 30 days. The healthcare costs are immense. Yet despite this, the tools available to diagnose and treat ECOPD are essentially unchanged, with the last new intervention (non-invasive ventilation) introduced over 25 years ago. An ECOPD is \u2018an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy\u2019. This symptom and healthcare utility-based definition does not describe pathology and is unable to differentiate from other causes of an acute deterioration in breathlessness with or without a cough and sputum. There is limited understanding of the host immune response during an acute event and no reliable and readily available means to identify aetiology or direct treatment at the point of care (POC). Corticosteroids, short acting bronchodilators with or without antibiotics have been the mainstay of treatment for over 30 years. This is in stark contrast to many other acute presentations of chronic illness, where specific biomarkers and mechanistic understanding has revolutionised care pathways. So why has progress been so slow in ECOPD? This review examines the history of diagnosing and treating ECOPD. It suggests that to move forward, there needs to be an acceptance that not all exacerbations are alike (just as not all COPD is alike) and that clinical presentation alone cannot identify aetiology or stratify treatment.","publish_time":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sapey, Elizabeth; Bafadhel, Mona; Bolton, Charlotte Emma; Wilkinson, Thomas; Hurst, John R; Quint, Jennifer K","journal":"Thorax","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b2ce678561ad7514e5b94e9b7ee832e2fb444fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6824608.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2018-213035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECOPD","COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECOPD","acute event","acute deterioration","years","acute presentations of chronic illness","acute attacks of chronic bronchitis","acute worsening of respiratory symptoms","exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","point of care","social care","care pathways","aetiology","direct treatment","mainstay of treatment","mechanistic understanding","limited understanding","increasing reliance","healthcare costs","tools available","healthcare utility-based definition","reduced quality of life","host immune response","specific biomarkers","readmission","morbidity","antibiotics","hospital","short acting bronchodilators","new intervention","quarter of in-patient episodes","non-invasive ventilation","breathlessness","causes","significant mortality","important events","Corticosteroids","pathology","additional therapy","stark contrast","history of diagnosing","clinical presentation","cough","review","days","POC","progress","sputum","prevalence","acceptance","century"],"language":"en"},

This change in fluorescence signal can be used to quantitate tau protein.

It can be difficult to determine the exact pathogen responsible for the infection and patients are often treated with empiric antibiotics. This study was conducted to identify the most common clinical characteristics of enteroviral meningitis in children and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for early detection of an enterovirus. METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of children admitted to Korea University Medical Center and diagnosed with meningitis on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and RT-PCR from CSF and other samples from January 2010 to August 2013. RESULTS: A total of 333 patients were enrolled and classified into four groups based on diagnosis: enteroviral meningitis (n=110), bacterial meningitis (n=23), other viral meningitis (n=36), and unknown etiology (n=164). Patients with bacterial meningitis were younger than those in the other groups (P\u003C0.001). Pleocytosis in CSF was similar across all groups. Of patients in the enteroviral meningitis group, 92.7% were diagnosed based on RT-PCR findings. Mean length of hospital stay for patients with enteroviral meningitis was 6.08 days, which was significantly shorter than that for patients with meningitis of bacterial etiology (19.73 days, P\u003C0.001). CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis before viral culture results are available is possible using RT-PCR. Accurate diagnosis reduces the length of hospital stay and helps to avoid unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment.","publish_time":"2015-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Dahee; Heo, Tae Hoon; Byeon, Jung Hye; Kim, Gun-Ha; Kim, Mi Kyung; Eun, So-Hee; Eun, Baik-Lin","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0de24e78d571664c4b8eece262fee6bbf4d55b80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4675926.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2015.58.11.446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26692881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF"],"locations":["Korea University Medical Center"],"keyphrases":["bacterial meningitis","Diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis","patients","enteroviral meningitis group","meningitis of bacterial etiology","common clinical characteristics of enteroviral meningitis","CSF","RT-PCR findings","groups","days","Accurate diagnosis","medical records of children","viral culture results","Mean length of hospital","common infections","unknown etiology","empiric antibiotics","Korea University Medical Center","unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment","diagnostic efficacy of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","analysis","basis of cerebrospinal fluid","exact pathogen responsible","central nervous system","early detection","total","CONCLUSION","enterovirus","METHODS","Pleocytosis","samples","PURPOSE","study"],"language":"en"},

Using the viral genomic data alone there was insufficient resolution to fully reconstruct within-household transmission chains. For households with clear index cases, the most likely source of infant infection was via a toddler (aged 1 to \u003C3 years-old) or school-aged (aged 6 to \u003C12 years-old) co-occupant.

A key assumption in the model is a relatively low elasticity of substitution between home and foreign inputs in the production of the vertically integrated good.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burstein, Ariel; Kurz, Christopher; Tesar, Linda","journal":"Journal of Monetary Economics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70a2a272c513f2350dbcd74c40f3abed9cb1e62c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115791.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393208000391; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304393208000391; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2008.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["integrated production","trade flows","synchronized business cycles","quantitative model of international business cycles","production sharing exhibit higher bilateral manufacturing output correlations","positive link","home","US multinationals","Mexican maquiladoras","low elasticity of substitution","foreign inputs","United States","data","affiliates","extent","Abstract Countries","key assumption"],"language":"en"},

It is characterized by wheeze, respiratory distress, and poor feeding. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause for bronchiolitis and is amongst the most important pathogens causing respiratory infection in infants worldwide. The healthcare burden of bronchiolitis is large, due to large numbers of hospitalized infants and the high risk of nosocomial spread during epidemics. Most children will suffer only mild, short-lived symptoms. A small proportion will need admission to hospital, where treatment is generally supportive until the illness resolves. Some will require ventilatory support for which mortality can be up to 10%. Infants at high risk of severe disease include those born prematurely, those with chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised infants. RSV infects ciliated epithelial cells, causing sloughing of the epithelium, cytokine and inflammatory mediator release, increases in mucus production, and interstitial edema. Clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis are a combined result of viral toxicity and the immune response to infection. Innate immune responses are important to the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, as severe infection tends to occur after maternal antibody protection has waned and before the infant\u0027s adaptive immune responses have matured. Immunoprophylaxis, in the form of intramuscular anti-RSV IgG1, is effective in reducing rates of hospitalization for high-risk infants.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smyth, R.

In the present study, we analyzed the spectrum of immune responses of mice to three different forms of the SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid (N): (1) exogenous recombinant protein (N-GST) with Freund\u0027s adjuvant; (2) DNA encoding unmodified N as an endogenous cytoplasmic protein (pN); and (3) DNA encoding N as a LAMP-1 chimera targeted to the lysosomal MHC II compartment (p-LAMP-N). Lysosomal trafficking of the LAMP/N chimera in transfected cells was documented by both confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. The responses of the immunized mice differed markedly. The strongest T-cell IFN-\u03B3 and CTL responses were to the LAMP-N chimera followed by the pN immunogen. In contrast, N-GST elicited strong T cell IL-4 but minimal IFN-\u03B3 responses and a much greater antibody response. Despite these differences, however, the immunodominant T-cell ELISpot responses to each of the three immunogens were elicited by the same N peptides, with the greatest responses being generated by a cluster of five overlapping peptides, N76\u2013114, each of which contained nonameric H2d binding domains with high binding scores for both class I and, except for N76\u201393, class II alleles. These results demonstrate that processing and presentation of N, whether exogenously or endogenously derived, resulted in common immunodominant epitopes, supporting the usefulness of modified antigen delivery and trafficking forms and, in particular, LAMP chimeras as vaccine candidates. Nevertheless, the profiles of T-cell responses were distinctly different. The pronounced Th-2 and humoral response to N protein plus adjuvant are in contrast to the balanced IFN-\u03B3 and IL-4 responses and strong memory CTL responses to the LAMP-N chimera.","publish_time":"2006-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Vandana; Tabiin, Tani M.; Sun, Kai; Chandrasekaran, Ananth; Anwar, Azlinda; Yang, Kun; Chikhlikar, Priya; Salmon, Jerome; Brusic, Vladimir; Marques, Ernesto T.A.; Kellathur, Srinivasan N.; August, Thomas J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2141f65d307159d96e111b2f68dff9fe7499054e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111852.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220500783X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220500783X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Freund"],"organizations":["SARS","CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell responses","N protein","LAMP-N chimera","N-GST","N peptides","unmodified N","presentation of N","greatest responses","immunodominant T-cell ELISpot responses","T-cell epitope responses of vaccine immunogens","minimal IFN-\u03B3 responses","strong memory CTL responses","strong T cell IL","spectrum of immune responses of mice","p-LAMP","LAMP chimeras","strongest T-cell IFN-\u03B3","profiles of T","balanced IFN-\u03B3","trafficking forms","different forms","vaccine efficacy","vaccine candidates","contrast","Lysosomal trafficking","DNA","N76","class","endogenous cytoplasmic protein","exogenous recombinant protein","humoral response","Freund\u0027s adjuvant","lysosomal MHC","overlapping peptides","immunized mice","pN immunogen","high binding scores","greater antibody response","common immunodominant epitopes","nonameric H2d binding domains","pathogen antigens","usefulness of modified antigen delivery","cluster","SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid","compartment","transfected cells","Abstract Correspondence","pronounced Th","processing","immunoelectron microscopy","results","present study","alleles","differences"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the relationship between an inciting event or agent and the development of IDC has progressed only recently. Once IDC has developed, treatment is palliative and little can be done to alter the natural course of the disease. Active myocarditis, a suspected precursor of IDC, is myocardial inflammation and injury without ischemia. The disease ranges from a self-limited flulike illness to one of serious consequence with arrhythmias, heart failure, or death. Many agents have been associated with myocarditis, and the clinical manifestations depend on an interplay between the inciting agent and the host response. The development of a murine model and the expanded use of endomyocardial biopsy using the Dallas criteria have increased our understanding of myocarditis and its sequelae. Therapy consists of managing symptoms using conventional medical regimens for heart failure. Immunosuppressive therapy should be reserved for patients with biopsy-proven disease who have failed conventional therapy.

This paper aims to examine the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated CT images obtained between 10 January 2019 and 16 February 2020 at Taihe Hospital. Scans were conducted 2\u20136 times per patient and the re-testing interval was 2\u20137 days. Ninety-five patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were included in this study and we retrospectively analysed their CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients underwent 2\u20133 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and received a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. Fifty-three were male and 42 were female, and their mean age was 42 \u00B1 12 years (range: 10 months to 81 years). Sixty-nine patients (72.6%) experienced fever, fatigue, and dry cough, while 15 (15.8%) had poor appetite and fatigue, and 11 (11.6%) had a dry cough and no fever. On CT imaging, early stage patients (n = 53, 55.8%) showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities; these were mainly local patches (22/53, 41.5%), while some lesions were accompanied by interlobular septal thickening. Thirty-four (35.8%) patients were classified in the \u2018progression stage\u2019 based on CT imaging; these patients typically showed lesions in multiple lung segments and lobes (21/34\uFF0C61.8%), and an uneven increase in ground-glass opacity density accompanied by consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows(30.5%). Two patients (2.1%) showed a severe presentation on CT. These showed diffuse bilateral lung lesions, mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation with cord-like interstitial thickening and air bronchograms, entire lung involvement with a \u201Cwhite lung\u201D presentation, and mild pleural effusion. Six patients in remission (6.3%), visible lesion absorption, fibrotic lesions. Based on clinical signs, 71 (74.7%), 22 (23.2%), and 2 (2.1%) patients had mild or moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Within the follow-up period, 93 patients recovered and were discharged, including the 53 early stage patients and 34 progression stage patients. The length of hospitalisation was 7\u201328 days (mean: 10 \u00B1 3.5 days). On discharge, lesions were significantly reduced in area and had in many cases completely disappeared, while slight pulmonary fibrosis was present in some patients. One severe stage patient was still hospitalised at the end of the follow-up period and the other severe stage patient died. The overall mortality rate was 1.05%. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 is important for early lesion detection, determining the nature of lesions, and assessing disease severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Ning; Zou, Xugong; Xu, Lin","journal":"Clin Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/914f97b59d2de75993cdad85b151e6c30f3ebc24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7214302.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707120301546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.042; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707120301546?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early stage patients","progression stage patients","severe stage patient","CT imaging characteristics of COVID","nature of lesions","fibrotic lesions","severe presentation","CT images","diffuse bilateral lung lesions","days","white lung","Coronavirus disease","positive SARS-CoV","mixed ground-glass opacities","entire lung involvement","ground-glass opacity density","consolidation","peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities","multiple lung segments","cord","early lesion detection","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","definitive diagnosis of COVID","follow-up period","years","fatigue","critical disease","dry cough","disease severity","nucleic acid test results","nucleic acid tests","interstitial thickening","experienced fever","mean age","visible lesion absorption","interlobular septal thickening","mild pleural effusion","air bronchograms","uneven increase","slight pulmonary fibrosis","re-testing interval","times","grid","lobes","cases","female","range","months","study","end","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","local patches","overall mortality rate","poor appetite","area","METHODS","remission","paper","length of hospitalisation","clinical signs","Taihe Hospital","Scans","shadows","discharge"],"language":"en"},

Our sequence data from a mitochondrial gene fragment (1176 base pair long) had a similarity of between 99% and 89% to Dipylidium caninum. We determined infection prevalence in 146 faecal samples from 124 known animals in three social groups (termed clans) using molecular screening and Dipylidium proglottid presence. Our analysis revealed significantly higher infection prevalence in juveniles (55%) than adults (15.8%), indicating that predominantly juveniles maintained infection in clans. The likelihood of infection in juveniles significantly: (1) increased as the number of adults and older juveniles (\u003E6 months) at communal dens increased, implying a positive relationship between this factor and the size of the intermediate host (probably a flea species) population at communal dens; (2) decreased as the number of younger juveniles (\u003C6 months) increased, suggesting that the chance of susceptible juveniles ingesting infected fleas during self-grooming declined as the number of infected fleas per younger juvenile declined; and (3) decreased during periods of low prey abundance in clan territories when an increased reliance on long-distances foraging excursions reduces the number of clan members visiting communal dens, possibly resulting in a decline in flea populations at dens. Long-distance foraging also increases the intervals (in days) between nursing visits by lactating females to their offspring. Lengthy intervals between milk intake by infected juveniles may reduce adult Dipylidium fecundity and hence decrease infection prevalence in the den flea population.

The human B-cell response to natural influenza virus infection has not been extensively investigated at the polyclonal level. Methods. The overall B-cell response of patients acutely infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) was analyzed by determining the reactivity of plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAbs) to influenza proteins. Recipients of inactivated influenza vaccine containing the same A(H1N1)pdm09 strain were studied for comparison. Results. During acute infection, robust plasmablast responses to the infecting virus were detected, characterized by a greater PPAb reactivity to the conserved influenza virus nuclear protein and to heterovariant and heterosubtypic hemagglutinins, in comparison to responses to the inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. In A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccinees, the presence of baseline serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting previous exposure to natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, did not affect the plasmablast response to vaccination, whereas repeated immunization with inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine resulted in significantly reduced vaccine-specific and cross-reactive PPAb responses. Conclusions. Natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination result in very distinct patterns of B-cell activation and priming. These differences are likely to be associated with differences in protective immunity, especially cross-protection against heterovariant and heterosubtypic influenza virus strains.","publish_time":"2014-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Xiao-Song; Holmes, Tyson H.; Sanyal, Mrinmoy; Albrecht, Randy A.; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Dekker, Cornelia L.; Davis, Mark M.; Greenberg, Harry B.","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df1b2547f6f1faf9bb9a757b60c81257bc811938.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4366605.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25336731/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiu580; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/211/7/1051/13806365/jiu580.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1","pdm09 virus","pdm09 infection","pdm09 vaccinees","pdm09 strain","natural influenza virus infection","pdm09 vaccination result","Recipients of inactivated influenza vaccine","heterosubtypic influenza virus strains","pandemic influenza","influenza proteins","infecting virus","conserved influenza virus nuclear protein","human B-cell response","acute infection","overall B-cell response of patients","heterovariant","reduced vaccine-specific","cross-reactive PPAb responses","cell activation","comparison","differences","distinct patterns of B","greater PPAb reactivity","derived polyclonal antibodies","heterosubtypic hemagglutinins","polyclonal level","cross-protection","presence of baseline serum","PPAbs","repeated immunization","previous exposure","protective immunity","Results","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Using data sets of the immune response during influenza-pneumococcal co-infection in mice, we employ here topological data analysis to simplify and visualise high dimensional data sets. We identified persistent shapes of the simplicial complexes of the data in the three infection scenarios: single viral infection, single bacterial infection, and co-infection. The immune response was found to be distinct for each of the infection scenarios and we uncovered that the immune response during the co-infection has three phases and two transition points. During the first phase, its dynamics is inherited from its response to the primary (viral) infection.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of children who presented to Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital and in whom HCoV was detected by a multiplex respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasal sample between October 2012 and March 2016. Lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was defined as possible or definite infiltrate seen in chest imaging, need for oxygen, or abnormal lung examination in conjunction with a physician diagnosis of LRTD. We used logistic regression modeling to evaluate risk factors for LRTD and LRTD that necessitated oxygen use (severe LRTD), including an immunocompromised state, in children with HCoV infection. RESULTS: The median ages of 85 immunocompromised and 1152 nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV infection were 6.3 and 1.6 years, respectively. The prevalence of LRTD and of severe LRTD did not differ greatly between the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients (22% vs 26% [LRTD] and 15% vs 11% [severe LRTD], respectively); however, in a multivariable model, an immunocompromised state was associated with an increased likelihood of severe LRTD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2\u20134.9]; P = .01). Younger age, having an underlying pulmonary disorder, and the presence of respiratory syncytial virus were also associated with LRTD or severe LRTD in multivariable models. The risks of LRTD or severe LRTD did not differ among the children with different HCoV strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a copathogen and host factors, including an immunocompromised state, were associated with increased risk for severe LRTD. Recognizing risk factors for severe respiratory illness might assist in risk stratification.","publish_time":"2018-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogimi, Chikara; Englund, Janet A; Bradford, Miranda C; Qin, Xuan; Boeckh, Michael; Waghmare, Alpana","journal":"Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34548f3a5ae5dea0d1896bec3f79204b61fcf6ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6437838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447395/; https://academic.oup.com/jpids/article-pdf/8/1/21/28233761/pix093.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/pix093","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital","LRTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of LRTD","risks of LRTD","increased likelihood of severe LRTD","physician diagnosis of LRTD","immunocompromised state","nonimmunocompromised children","severe respiratory illness","cohort of children","risk factors","increased risk","different HCoV strains","clinical features of HCoV infection","risk stratification","host factors","presence of respiratory syncytial virus","nonimmunocompromised patients","Lower respiratory tract disease","multiplex respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay","oxygen use","strains OC43","multivariable models","HCoVs","conjunction","serious infections","adjusted odds ratio","abnormal lung examination","underlying pulmonary disorder","virologic","nasal sample","human coronaviruses","chest imaging","logistic regression modeling","Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital","definite infiltrate","NL63","HKU1","copathogen","Younger age","median ages","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","years","BACKGROUND","confidence interval","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from January 16, 2020, to February 25, 2020. Furthermore, 92 CT scans of confirmed patients with influenza pneumonia, including 76 with influenza A and 16 with influenza B, scanned between January 1, 2019, to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Pulmonary lesion distributions, number, attenuation, lobe predomination, margin, contour, ground-glass opacity involvement pattern, bronchial wall thickening, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion were evaluated in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia cohorts. RESULTS: Peripheral and non-specific distributions in COVID-19 showed a markedly higher frequency compared with the influenza group (p \u003C 0.05). Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p \u003C 0.05). COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p \u003C 0.05). COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p \u003C 0.05). The lesion number and attenuation, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular septal thickening were not significantly different between the two groups (all p \u003E 0.05).

However, whilst chickens may be acutely susceptible, ducks appear to be asymptomatic to H5N1. The mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are not well understood and the variation between different species requires investigation to help explain these species differences. Here we investigated the expression of several key proinflammatory cytokines of chickens and ducks following infection with 2 highly pathogenic H5N1 (A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/453/2004 (Vt453) and A/Duck/Indramayu/BBVW/109/2006 (Ind109)) and a low-pathogenic H5N3 influenza virus (A/Duck/Victoria/1462/2008 (Vc1462)). H5N1 viruses caused fatal infections in chickens as well as high viral loads and increased production of proinflammatory molecules when compared to ducks. Cytokines, including Interleukin 6 (IL6) and the acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA), were rapidly induced at 24h post infection with H5N1. In contrast, low induction of these cytokines appeared in ducks and only at later times during the infection period. These observations support that hypercytokinemia may contribute to pathogenesis in chickens, whilst the lower cytokine response in ducks may be a factor in their apparent resistance to disease and decreased mortality.","publish_time":"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burggraaf, Simon; Karpala, Adam J.; Bingham, John; Lowther, Sue; Selleck, Paul; Kimpton, Wayne; Bean, Andrew G.D.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba7a0c799426d375bd907adc21755b1726fc6aec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127704.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214001191; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214001191; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ducks","pathogenic H5N1","H5N1 influenza virus","H5N1 viruses","key proinflammatory cytokines of chickens","Abstract Infection","infection period","Muscovy duck","h post infection","low-pathogenic H5N3 influenza virus","mechanisms of disease pathogenesis","fatal infections","low induction","different species","species differences","increased production of proinflammatory molecules","high viral loads","acute phase protein Serum Amyloid","apparent resistance","IL6","investigation","poultry","factor","lower cytokine response","SAA","death","decreased mortality","later times","hours","variation","Ind109","Indramayu","BBVW","Vietnam","Victoria","contrast","expression","hypercytokinemia","Vt453","days","Vc1462","Interleukin","observations"],"language":"en"},

Earlier, we reported that a toll-like-receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, resiquimod (R-848), stimulated the systemic immunity when adjuvanted with the inactivated Newcastle disease virus vaccine in the chicken. Here, we report the effect of R-848 when adjuvanted with live or inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccines with special emphasis on mucosal immunity. Specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks (n = 60) were equally divided into six groups at two weeks of age and immunized with either inactivated or live IBV vaccine adjuvanted with or without R-848. Groups that received either PBS or R-848 served as control. A booster was given on 14 days post-immunization (dpi). R-848 enhanced the antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses when co-administered with the vaccines as evidenced by an increase in the antibody titre in ELISA and stimulation index in lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) till 35 dpi and increased proportion of CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells on 21 dpi in the flow cytometry. Interestingly, it potentiated the IgA responses in the tear and intestinal secretions when used with both live and inactivated IBV vaccines. The combination of IBV vaccine with R-848 significantly up-regulated the transforming growth factor beta 4 (TGF\u03B24) transcripts in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than that of the respective vaccine per se. An enhanced secretory IgA response is likely due to the up-regulation of TGF\u03B24, which is responsible for class switching to IgA. In conclusion, co-administration of R-848 with inactivated or live IBV vaccine enhanced the systemic as well as mucosal immune responses in the chicken.","publish_time":"2018-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matoo, Javaid Jeelani; Bashir, Khalid; Kumar, Ajay; Krishnaswamy, Narayanan; Dey, Sohini; Chellappa, Madhan Mohan; Ramakrishnan, Saravanan","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d1cff78c70dbc0bead309c5770130206ee6b156.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127065.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29635053/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401018302948; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401018302948","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["live IBV vaccine","inactivated IBV vaccines","effect of R","combination of IBV vaccine","co-administration of R","mucosal immune responses","IgA responses","respective vaccine","inactivated Newcastle disease virus vaccine","mucosal immunity","cellular immune responses","enhanced secretory IgA response","inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus","systemic immunity","chicken","groups","regulation of TGF\u03B24","T cells","antigen specific humoral","Specific pathogen free","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","stimulation index","ELISA","transcripts","lymphocyte transformation test","special emphasis","LTT","antibody titre","SPF","chicks","PBMCs","transforming growth factor beta","intestinal secretions","TLR7","agonist","tear","receptor","pathogens","CD8","resiquimod","class","conclusion","Adjuvant","days post-immunization","increased proportion of CD4","portal of entry","booster","weeks of age","PBS","flow cytometry","toll","control"],"language":"en"},

The RNA cap has multiple roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. Apart from guanosine addition to the 5\u2032 end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (in particular mRNA), essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation. The complexity of the cap structure and its formation can range from just a single methylation of the unprocessed 5\u2032 end of the primary transcript, as in mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3 RNAs, to an elaborate m(7)Gpppm(6,6)AmpAmpCmpm(3)Um structure at the 5\u2032 end of processed RNA in trypanosomes, which are formed by as many as 8 methylation reactions. While all enzymes responsible for methylation of the cap structure characterized to date were found to belong to the same evolutionarily related and structurally similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily, that uses the same methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine; the enzymes also exhibit interesting differences that are responsible for their distinct functions. This review focuses on the evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible for cap methylation in RNA, with a focus on the sequence relationships and structural similarities and dissimilarities that provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis of different caps in cellular and viral RNAs. Particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between methyltransferases from human cells and from human pathogens that may be helpful in the development of antiviral and antiparasitic drugs.","publish_time":"2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Byszewska, Magdalena; \u015Amieta\u0144ski, Miros\u0142aw; Purta, El\u017Cbieta; Bujnicki, Janusz M","journal":"RNA Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f67baef306ea56d7b574059fb72ff68affb0246.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4615557.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2015.1004955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA cap","cap methylation","so-called cap structure","cap modifications","typical cap structure common","end of processed RNA","RNA polymerase","Um structure","important RNAs","single methylation","methylation reactions","viral RNAs","enhancement of RNA stability","end of mRNA molecules","evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible","plant U3 RNAs","particular mRNA","human cells","structural similarities","human pathogens","interesting differences","Particular attention","gene expression","mouse B2","different caps","transcripts","mammalian U6","S-adenosylmethionine","multiple roles","similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily","SK","dissimilarities","sequence relationships","nucleocytoplasmic transport","methyltransferases","focus","interactions","mechanism of biosynthesis","primary transcript","methyl group donor","development of antiviral","basis","antiparasitic drugs","translation initiation","cytoplasmic proteins","AmpAmpCmpm","trypanosomes","formation","distinct functions","Gpppm","review","guanosine addition","complexity","date","eukaryotes","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Type I IFN signaling in CD8(\u002B) T cells, in cooperation with IL-27 and IL-2 signaling, promotes and sustains the expression of IRF4 and Blimp-1, two transcription factors required for the production of IL-10 by effector CD8(\u002B) T cells.

Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infection. In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent spillover events.

Genetic analysis of the complete M and ORF3 genes showed that each PEDV group had several unique characteristics, and this indicated that specific groups of PEDVs may be differentiated from the other PEDVs by specific nucleotide differences. Especially, ORF3 gene analysis can be used for discrimination between vaccine and wild-type PEDVs.

In particular, the Orsay virus RNA2 segment encodes a putative novel protein of unknown function, termed delta, which is absent from all known nodaviruses. Here we present evidence that Orsay virus utilizes a ribosomal frameshifting strategy to express a novel fusion protein from the viral capsid (alpha) and delta ORFs. Moreover, the fusion protein was detected in purified virus fractions, demonstrating that it is most likely incorporated into Orsay virions. Furthermore, N-terminal sequencing of both the fusion protein and the capsid protein demonstrated that these proteins must be translated from a non-canonical initiation site.

While IFITMs are widely known to inhibit several single-stranded RNA viruses, there are limited reports available regarding their effect in double-stranded DNA viruses. In this work, we have analyzed a possible antiviral function of IFITMs against a double stranded DNA virus, the African swine fever virus (ASFV). Infection with cell-adapted ASFV isolate Ba71V is IFN sensitive and it induces IFITMs expression. Interestingly, high levels of IFITMs caused a collapse of the endosomal pathway to the perinuclear area. Given that ASFV entry is strongly dependent on endocytosis, we investigated whether IFITM expression could impair viral infection. Expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 reduced virus infectivity in Vero cells, with IFITM2 and IFITM3 having an impact on viral entry/uncoating. The role of IFITM2 in the inhibition of ASFV in Vero cells could be related to impaired endocytosis-mediated viral entry and alterations in the cholesterol efflux, suggesting that IFITM2 is acting at the late endosome, preventing the decapsidation stage of ASFV.","publish_time":"2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu\u00F1oz-Moreno, Raquel; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel \u00C1ngel; Mart\u00EDnez-Romero, Carles; Barrado-Gil, Luc\u00EDa; Galindo, Inmaculada; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Alonso, Covadonga","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e47f269f449983eb0dc70d257f09f27b1e81247.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4846163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27116236/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASFV","IFITM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASFV entry","viral entry","IFITMs expression","inhibition of ASFV","viral infection","double stranded DNA virus","viral progression","IFITM expression","cell-adapted ASFV","decapsidation stage of ASFV","double-stranded DNA viruses","Vero cells","endosomal membrane","possible antiviral function of IFITMs","role of IFITM2","high levels of IFITMs","Expression of IFITM1","single-stranded RNA viruses","reduced virus infectivity","African swine fever virus","impaired endocytosis","endosomal pathway","membrane fusion","group of antiviral restriction factors","effect","IFN sensitive","IFITM3","limited reports available","protein family","flexibility","Ba71V","collapse","alterations","impact","cholesterol efflux","late endosome","plasma","perinuclear area","uncoating","interferon","work"],"language":"en"},

People\u0027s adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents\u0027 KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors\u0027 networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents\u0027 attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P\u003C0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, causes substantial economic loss in the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies reported miRNA involvement in viral infection; however, their role in regulating PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulatory relationship between miRNA-221-5p and PEDV infection, finding that miR-221-5p overexpression inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, and that silencing endogenous miR-221-5p enhanced viral replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p directly targets the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of PEDV genomic RNA to inhibit PEDV replication, and that miR-221-5p overexpression activates nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB signaling via p65 nuclear translocation, thereby upregulating interferon (IFN)-\u03B2, IFN-stimulated gene 15, and MX1 expression during CH/HBTS/2017 infection. We subsequently identified NF-\u03BAB-inhibitor \u03B1 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, negative regulators of the NF-\u03BAB pathway, as miR-221-5p targets. These results demonstrated the ability of miR-221-5p to inhibit PEDV replication by targeting the 3\u2019 UTR of the viral genome and activating the NF-\u03BAB-signaling pathway. Our findings will aid the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Hongqing; Xu, Lei; Liu, Yuzhong; Li, Cheng; Zhang, Liang; Wang, Tao; Zhao, Di; Xu, Xingang; Zhang, Yanming","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/826b7e6b690a85314484d1eaf93fb020603b3479.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6274926.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19113381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","p targets","p overexpression inhibited PEDV replication","viral infection","viral replication","endogenous miR","ability of miR","PEDV genomic RNA","NF-\u03BAB pathway","UTR","viral genome","results","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","IFN-stimulated gene","etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea","posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression","MX1 expression","nuclear factor","miRNA involvement","p65 nuclear translocation","substantial economic loss","critical roles","dose-dependent manner","class of noncoding RNAs","suppressor of cytokine","interferon","development of preventive","inhibitor \u03B1","negative regulators","therapeutic strategies","Previous studies","numerous biological processes","swine industry","CH","HBTS","untranslated region","miRNAs","regulatory relationship","study","MicroRNAs","findings"],"language":"en"},

Capacity needs in cities in China could inform the planning of local health care resources. OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2 cities in China to estimate the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if an outbreak equivalent to that in Wuhan occurs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study analyzed the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China, from January 10 to February 29, 2020. EXPOSURES: Timing of disease control measures relative to timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of critical and severe patient\u2013days and peak number of patients with critical and severe illness during the study period. RESULTS: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented 6 weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, 2020, patients with COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 429 (25-1143) patients in the ICU and 1521 (111-7202) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 19 425 patients (24.5 per 10 000 adults) were hospitalized, 9689 (12.2 per 10 000 adults) were considered in serious condition, and 2087 (2.6 per 10 000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within 1 week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 9 (7-12) patients in the ICU and 17 (15-26) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition and 38 were classified as having serious illness. The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities was estimated to range from 2.2 to 4.4 per 10 000 adults, depending on differences in age distribution and comorbidity (ie, hypertension) prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of patients with serious COVID-19 illness continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local health care systems in US cities.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ruoran; Rivers, Caitlin; Tan, Qi; Murray, Megan B.; Toner, Eric; Lipsitch, Marc","journal":"JAMA Netw Open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7203604.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32374400/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.8297","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China","Guangzhou","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["peak number of patients","serious COVID","ill patients","serious illness","Number of critical","severe illness","critical care","peak ICU bed","adults","major US cities","epidemic peak","consequences of COVID","serious condition","strict disease control measures","coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","China","critical condition","ICU capacities","lockdown of Wuhan","Timing of disease control measures relative","local health care systems","local transmission of SARS","confirmed cases of COVID","timing of SARS","local hospitalization","interquartile range","planning of local health care resources","severe patient","projected number of prevalent","intensive care unit","Guangzhou","median","inpatients","Capacity needs","Sustained spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","inpatient bed","community spread","study period","outbreak equivalent","comparative effectiveness study","outbreaks","weeks","days","comorbidity","PARTICIPANTS","age distribution","differences","IMPORTANCE","EXPOSURES","MAIN OUTCOMES","hypertension","SETTING","RESULTS","week of case importation","RELEVANCE","prevalence","DESIGN","month","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","Plans"],"language":"en"},

A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the wind flow field and the pollutant dispersion was developed and validated by wind tunnel data. Then the spreading of the pollutant emitted from different locations to a rectangular-shaped high-rise residential (HRR) building was numerically studied. The pollutant source location was set in a wide range of the position angle and distance between the source and the building. It was found that the pollutant concentration on the building decreases with an increase in the emission distance whereas the effect of the position angle is more complicated. Interestingly, there is a critical range of the position angle from which the emitted pollutants will not spread to the building in a significant way. The effect of the source location was linked to the wind flow field around the building, particularly with several major flows. The vertical distributions of the pollutant concentration on different faces were also investigated, and it was found that these are more affected by the vertical flow near each face. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the pollutant concentration as a function of the emission distance and position angle.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(6), e479\u2013e486. Background To collect disease information and provide data for early detection of epidemics, two surveillance systems were established for influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) and unexplained pneumonia (UP) in Wuxi, People\u2019s Republic of China. Objectives The current study aims to describe the performance of these surveillance systems during 2004\u20132009 and to evaluate the value of surveillance data in detection of influenza epidemics. Methods Two national ILI sentinel hospitals and three UP sentinel hospitals provided data to the surveillance systems. The surveillance data from hospital\u2010based outpatient clinics and emergency rooms were compared by year. The ILI data of 2009 were further modeled based on previous data using both a control chart method and a moving average regression method. Alarms of potential epidemics would be raised when the input surveillance data surpassed a threshold. Results In 2009, the proportions of ILI and respiratory illness with fever (one surveillance syndrome of the UP system) to total patient visits (3\u00B740% and 11\u00B776%, respectively) were higher than the previous years. The surveillance data of both systems also showed developing trends similar to the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. When the surveillance data of 2009 were fitted in the two detection models, alarms were produced on the occurrence of the first local case of influenza A (H1N1), outbreaks in schools and in general populations. Conclusions The results indicated the potential for using ILI and UP surveillance data as syndromic indicators to detect and provide an early warning for influenza epidemics.","publish_time":"2011-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Yan\u2010Hua; Su, Jing; Shi, Ping; He, En\u2010Qi; Shao, Jie; Sun, Na; Zu, Rong\u2010Qiang; Yu, Rong\u2010Bin","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04f9e08f4eb5091105c2cca3133719d1bd10b1dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780665.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00248.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668678/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance data of influenza","ILI data","input surveillance data","value of surveillance data","surveillance systems","previous data","surveillance syndrome","detection of influenza epidemics","early detection of influenza","early detection of epidemics","local case of influenza","H1N1","proportions of ILI","Alarms of potential epidemics","national ILI sentinel hospitals","respiratory illness","detection models","early warning","unexplained pneumonia","pandemic","Results","Respiratory Viruses","previous years","control chart method","based outpatient clinics","moving average regression method","emergency rooms","Wuxi","outbreaks","fever","developing trends similar","disease information","schools","Methods","performance","syndromic indicators","current study","People\u2019s Republic of China","total patient visits","general populations","occurrence","threshold","e479","Objectives","Background","Qian","Conclusions","e486","paper"],"language":"en"},

We describe such an expansion of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family in certain bat families. Members of the CEA family in humans and mice are exploited as cellular receptors by a number of pathogens, possibly due to their function in immunity and reproduction. The CEA family is composed of CEA-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and secreted pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs). PSGs are almost exclusively expressed by trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface. The reason why PSGs exist only in a minority of mammals is still unknown. RESULTS: Analysis of the CEA gene family in bats revealed that in certain bat families, belonging to the subgroup Yangochiroptera but not the Yinpterochiroptera subgroup an expansion of the CEA gene family took place, resulting in approximately one hundred CEA family genes in some species of the Vespertilionidae. The majority of these genes encode secreted PSG-like proteins (further referred to as PSG). Remarkably, we found strong evidence that the ligand-binding domain (IgV-like domain) of PSG is under diversifying positive selection indicating that bat PSGs may interact with structurally highly variable ligands. Such ligands might represent bacterial or viral pathogen adhesins. We have identified two distinct clusters of PSGs in three Myotis species. The two PSG cluster differ in the amino acids under positive selection. One cluster was only expanded in members of the Vespertilionidae while the other was found to be expanded in addition in members of the Miniopteridae and Mormoopidae. Thus one round of PSG expansion may have occurred in an ancestry of all three families and a second only in Vespertilionidae. Although maternal ligands of PSGs may exist selective challenges by two distinct pathogens seem to be likely responsible for the expansion of PSGs in Vespertilionidae. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid expansion of PSGs in certain bat species together with selection for diversification suggest that bat PSGs could be part of a pathogen defense system by serving as decoy receptors and/or regulators of feto-maternal interactions.

METHODS: Data were retrieved from accurate databases according to the user\u2019s guide of data sources for patient registries, CFR and recovery rates were calculated for each country. A comparison of CFR between countries with total cases \u2265 1,000 was observed for 12(th) and 23(rd) March. RESULTS: Italy\u2019s CFR was the highest of all countries studied for both time points (12(th) March, 6.22% versus 23(rd) March, 9.26%).

CONCLUSION: Obtaining detailed and accurate medical history from COVID-19 patients, and analyzing CFR alongside the recovery rate, may enable the identification of the highest risk areas so that efficient medical care may be provided.

This study represents the first attempt to characterise viral aetiologies of ILIs in Bolivia. METHODS: It was performed in Santa Cruz city from January 2010 to September 2012, based on 564 naso-pharyngeal swabs collected in a National Reference Laboratory and real-time PCR techniques, viral cultures and phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: 50.2% of samples were positive for at least one virus with influenza viruses (Flu A: ~15%; Flu B: ~9%), rhinoviruses (~8%), coronaviruses (~5%) and hRSV (~4%) being the most frequently identified. The pattern of viral infections varied according to age groups. The elucidation rate was the highest (\u003E60%) amongst patients under 10 yo and the lowest (\u003C40%) amongst patients \u226560 yo. Nearly 3% of samples showed dual viral infections. Epidemiological peaks were associated with a predominant virus but generally included 30-50% of infections by different viruses. Unexpectedly, the frequency of influenza in the 0\u20134 yo population was very low and a complete hRSV eclipse occurred in 2011. Genetic analyses indicated that distinct evolutionary lineages of Flu A(H1N1)pdm2009, Flu A/H3N2 and Flu B have co-circulated in Bolivia in the study period, originating from Central and North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. CONCLUSION: Our results emphasise the requirement for a reinforced epidemiological and genetic follow-up of influenza and other ILIs in Bolivia to further inform the preparation of vaccines used in the region, guide vaccination campaigns and improve the medical management of patients.","publish_time":"2014-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delangue, Julie; Roca Sanchez, Yelin; Piorkowski, G\u00E9raldine; Bessaud, Ma\u00EBl; Baronti, C\u00E9cile; Thirion-Perrier, Laurence; Mafayle, Roxana Loayza; Ardaya, Cinthia Avila; Aguilera, Gabriela A\u00F1ez; Guzman, Jimmy Revollo; Riera, Javier Lora; de Lamballerie, Xavier","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a7fdc03389aef740cb9d6de762e96e52473b236.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4015617.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564892/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Like Illnesses","National Reference Laboratory"],"locations":["Santa Cruz","Europe","Asia","Australia","Bolivia"],"keyphrases":["Flu B","viral aetiologies of ILIs","dual viral infections","pattern of viral infections","Bolivia","influenza viruses","viral cultures","frequency of influenza","virological aetiologies of Influenza","genetic follow-up of influenza","distinct evolutionary lineages of Flu","Acute respiratory infections","samples","yo population","RESULTS","medical management of patients","phylogenetic analyses","study period","Epidemiological peaks","predominant virus","different viruses","complete hRSV eclipse","real-time PCR techniques","serious public health issue","National Reference Laboratory","H3N2","region","Europe","North America","guide vaccination campaigns","requirement","H1N1","Illnesses","Asia","pdm2009","attempt","naso-pharyngeal swabs","Australia","preparation of vaccines","BACKGROUND","age groups","developing countries","Santa Cruz city","elucidation rate","CONCLUSION","METHODS","rhinoviruses","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Detection of enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens by PCR is the gold standard diagnostic test. Our aim was to assess a method of detecting enterovirus in blood specimens by PCR. METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, observational study at 35 French paediatric and emergency departments in 16 hospitals. We recruited newborn babies (aged \u226428 days) and infants (aged \u003E28 days to \u22642 years) with fever without source, sepsis-like disease, or suspected meningitis, and children (aged \u003E2 years to \u226416 years) with suspected meningitis, who were admitted to a participating hospital. We used a standardised form to obtain demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, which were anonymised. Enterovirus PCR testing was done in blood and CSF specimens. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2015, and Oct 31, 2015, and between June 1, 2016, and Oct 31, 2016, we enrolled 822 patients, of whom 672 had enterovirus PCR testing done in blood and CSF specimens. Enterovirus was detected in 317 (47%) patients in either blood or CSF, or both (71 newborn babies, 83 infants, and 163 children). Detection of enterovirus was more frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of newborn babies (70 [99%] of 71 vs 62 [87%] of 71; p=0\u00B7011) and infants (76 [92%] of 83 vs 62 [75%] of 83; p=0\u00B7008), and was less frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of children (90 [55%] of 163 vs 148 [91%] of 163; p\u003C0\u00B70001). Detection of enterovirus was more frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of infants aged 2 years or younger with fever without source (55 [100%] of 55 vs 41 [75%] of 55; p=0\u00B70002) or with sepsis-like disease (16 [100%] of 16 vs nine [56%] of 16; p=0\u00B7008). Detection of enterovirus was less frequent in blood than in CSF of patients with suspected meningitis (165 [67%] of 246 vs 222 [90%] of 246; p\u003C0\u00B70001). INTERPRETATION: Testing for enterovirus in blood by PCR should be an integral part of clinical practice guidelines for infants aged 2 years or younger. This testing could decrease the length of hospital stay and reduce exposure to antibiotics for low-risk patients admitted to the emergency department with febrile illness.

In the present study, we aimed to develop a real-time RT-PCR method for detection of BVDV-1 in aerosol samples. METHODS: A pair of primers specific for highly conserved regions of the BVDV-1 5\u2032-UTR was designed. The standard curve and sensitivity of the developed assay were assessed based on 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA molecular standard. The specificity of the assay was evaluated with other pestiviruses and infectious bovine viruses. The clinical performance was examined by testing 169 aerosol samples. RESULTS: The results showed that a good linear relationship existed between the standard curve and the concentration of template. The lowest detection limit was 5.2 RNA molecules per reaction. This assay was specific for detection of BVDV-1, and no amplification was found for other pestiviruses such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), and common infectious bovine viruses, including BVDV-2, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) and bovine coronavirus (BcoV). The assay was highly reproducible with low variation coefficient values (CVs) for intra-assay and inter-assay. A total of 169 aerosol samples collected from six dairy herds were tested using this method. The results showed that the positive detection rate of BVDV-1 was 17.2% (29/169), which was significantly higher compared with the conventional RT-PCR. Additionally, the positive samples (n = 29) detected by real-time RT-PCR were verified by BVDV RPA-LFD, and a concordance rate of 100% was obtained between them. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we developed a real-time RT-PCR assay for quantitative analysis of BVDV-1 in aerosol samples, and our finding provided valuable insights into the risk on aerosol transmission of BVDV-1.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Peili; Xu, Yaru; Wang, Hongmei; He, Hongbin","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3a37a59ef80110ea8373ff17d3f77233b5bb95e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159024.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02330-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of BVDV","infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus","aerosol transmission of BVDV","aerosol samples","bovine ephemeral fever virus","bovine viral diarrhea virus","bovine parainfluenza virus type","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","bovine coronavirus","real-time RT-PCR assay","developed assay","positive detection rate of BVDV","intra-assay","inter-assay","quantitative analysis of BVDV","BVDV RPA-LFD","common infectious bovine viruses","positive samples","border disease virus","real-time RT-PCR method","classical swine fever virus","conventional RT-PCR","RESULTS","standard curve","pestiviruses","lowest detection limit","RNA molecules","fold serial dilutions of RNA molecular standard","concordance rate","pair of primers specific","BRSV","IBRV","CVs","CSFV","BEFV","low variation coefficient values","risk","Flaviviridae family","BDV","BPIV","valuable insights","finding","good linear relationship","conserved regions","infected animals","animal husbandry","dairy herds","sensitivity","direct contact","large burden","METHODS","reaction","concentration of template","BcoV","aerosols","amplification","total","clinical performance","present study","BACKGROUND","specificity","UTR","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Early tests for diagnosis were not always conclusive in identifying a SARS suspected patient. Nucleocapsid protein (NP) is the most predominant virus derived structural protein which is shed in high amounts in serum and nasopharyngeal aspirate during the first week of infection. As part of such efforts, a simple, easy to use immunoswab method was developed by generating a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), Bispecific MAbs and chicken polyclonal IgY antibody against the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP). Employing the MAb-based immunoswab, an NP concentration of 200 pg/mL in saline and pig nasopharyngeal aspirate, and 500 pg/mL in rabbit serum were detected. BsMAb-based immunoswabs detected an NP concentration of 20 pg/mL in saline, 500 pg/mL in rabbit serum and 20\u2013200 pg/mL in pig nasopharyngeal aspirate. Polyclonal IgY-based immunoswabs detected an NP concentration of 10 pg/mL in pig nasopharyngeal aspirate providing the most sensitive SARS point of care assay. Results show that the robust immunoswab method of detecting SARS-CoV NP antigen can be developed into an easy and effective way of identifying SARS suspected individuals during a future SARS epidemic, thereby reducing and containing the transmission.

Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease. The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses. Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care. Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic. A novel coronavirus \u2014 officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 by the authorities \u2014 emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019 [1, 2].

In an attempt to restrict the outbreak, China quickly implemented an unprecedented measure of quarantining 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities, but its impact on slowing the global spread of the virus now seems inadequate. In fact, the number of cases in local human-to-human transmission kept soaring in several countries as of March 25, 2020: Italy 63,927 cases, United States of America 42,164 cases, and Spain 33,089 cases [3].

The patient had chronic hepatitis B and history of exposure to poultry. The patient initially complained of diarrhea and influenza-like symptoms on March 7 and 14 respectively. The disease progressed to severe pneumonia, sustained hypoxia, and coagulation abnormalities. The patient died on March 27 because of respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation without oseltamivir treatment. This H7N9 virus from Zhejiang is highly similar to isolates obtained from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, etc. Analysis of hemagglutinin, neuramidinase, and matrix genes indicated that the isolates share the same avian origin, have low virulence, and are sensitive to oseltamivir, but are resistant to adamantine. Only the isolate that caused the fatality exhibited substitution of Q226I in the HA gene, which indicates a potentially enhanced human affinity. The secondary transmission rate was 1.6% (2/125). Only two health workers presented with influenza-like symptoms, and they subsequently tested negative for H7N9 RNA. In conclusion, underlying disease, late diagnosis, and untimely antiviral treatment are possible high-risk factors for infections and death caused by the lowpathogenicity avian influenza A (H7N9). Person-to-person transmission of the H7N9 virus was not detected among close contacts, but such transmission should be investigated in the future. Expanding and enhancing surveillance will help in the early discovery and diagnosis of suspected cases, which will reduce the number of severe cases and deaths.","publish_time":"2013-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Enfu; Wang, Fenjuan; Lv, Huakun; Zhang, Yanjun; Ding, Hua; Liu, Shelan; Cai, Jian; Xie, Li; Xu, Xiaoping; Chai, Chengliang; Mao, Haiyan; Sun, Jimin; Lin, Junfen; Yu, Zhao; Li, Lianhong; Chen, Zhiping; Xia, Shichang","journal":"Front Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/173e6c78d389ac208e41b838259e55c2f2128869.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-013-0275-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23757033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Zhejiang","China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 virus","H7N9 RNA","patient","lowpathogenicity avian influenza","novel avian influenza","person transmission","oseltamivir treatment","avian origin","isolates","symptoms","diagnosis of suspected cases","number of severe cases","secondary transmission rate","late diagnosis","respiratory failure","intravascular coagulation","coagulation abnormalities","underlying disease","severe pneumonia","Zhejiang Province","untimely antiviral treatment","multiple organ failure","possible high-risk factors","infections","history of exposure","sustained hypoxia","chronic hepatitis B","early discovery","substitution of Q226I","Analysis of hemagglutinin","low virulence","Anhui","neuramidinase","Jiangsu","matrix genes","Shanghai","conclusion","HA gene","close contacts","fatality","poultry","deaths","China","diarrhea","health workers","enhanced human affinity","surveillance","study","future"],"language":"en"},

To understand the mechanism by which a virus escapes from antibody-mediated neutralization, we have investigated the interactions of non-neutralizing and neutralizing antibodies at an epitope cluster on the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The epitope cluster was mapped at the C-terminus of the spike protein; it consists of structurally intertwined epitopes recognized by two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 341C and 540C, and a non-neutralizing mAb, 240C. While mAb 341C binds to a mostly linear epitope composed of residues 507PAT509 and V349, mAb 240C binds to an epitope that partially overlaps the former by at least two residues (P507 and A508). The epitope corresponding to mAb 540C is a conformational one, involving residues L504 and N505. In neutralization assays, non-neutralizing 240C disrupted virus neutralization by mAb 341C and/or mAb 540C, whereas a combination of mAbs 341C and 540C blocked virus infectivity synergistically. These findings indicate that the epitope cluster on the spike protein may serve as an evolutionarily conserved platform at which a dynamic interplay between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies occurs, thereby determining the outcome of SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2009-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Lilin; Haynes, Lia; Struble, Evi Budo; Tamin, Azaibi; Virata-Theimer, Maria Luisa; Zhang, Pei","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdef988c48b926187700add91c4facdb35ca3fb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092930.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X09021068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19861118/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X09021068","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C binds","C-terminus","non-neutralizing mAb","non-neutralizing antibodies","C disrupted virus neutralization","epitope cluster","interactions of non-neutralizing","C blocked virus infectivity","neutralizing monoclonal antibodies","linear epitope","presence of excess neutralizing antibody","antibody-mediated neutralization","virus escapes","neutralization assays","Abstract Incomplete neutralization of virus","CoV infection","SARS-CoV","residues 507PAT509","residues L504","spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","outcome of SARS","combination of mAbs","immune prophylaxis of viral infection","dynamic interplay","V349","successful vaccine design","biological phenomenon","intertwined epitopes","conserved platform","P507","A508","N505","mechanism","findings"],"language":"en"},

Our approach captures the main topological and spatial changes from a complex network perspective. We find that the SAAN combines a relatively stable topological structure with a changing multilayered geographical structure. Statistical analysis indicates that the SAAN is a scale-free network with an increasing number of hub cities and has been characterized by small-world properties since 1996. Furthermore, the SAAN exhibits a recently intensified disassortative mixing pattern, suggesting an increasing dependence of small cities on hub-and-spoke configuration for better accessibility. A decomposition analysis is used to disaggregate the SAAN into a hierarchical core-bridge-periphery structure. The core layer consists of capital cities, the most economic vibrant secondary cities, and tourist destinations. This core layer is also densely interconnected with its center of gravity moving towards the north. The periphery layer, comprised of cities in remote areas, sustains a low significance with declining internal connectivity despite a rising number of cities being connected. The bridge layer lies in between both extremes, and is characterized by a high volatility over time. The connections and passengers between different layers increase, especially those between core and bridge after 1996. In our discussion, we trace these changes back to a series of socio-economic and politico-institutional dynamics in Southeast Asia.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Liang; Derudder, Ben; Liu, Xingjian","journal":"Journal of Transport Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03ec40090f85bf19b228d765405f3ff67eebb698.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127681.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288377/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096669231730652X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096669231730652X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.02.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAAN"],"locations":["Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["SAAN","core layer","capital cities","bridge layer","increasing number of hub cities","rising number of cities","periphery structure","periphery layer","increasing dependence of small cities","hierarchical core-bridge","evolving structure","stable topological structure","economic vibrant secondary cities","changing multilayered geographical structure","complex network perspective","scale-free network","Southeast Asian air transport network","spatial changes","novel approach","Statistical analysis","decomposition analysis","small-world properties","declining internal connectivity","low significance","politico-institutional dynamics","series of socio-economic","tourist destinations","remote areas","pattern","different layers","intensified disassortative","connections","passengers","configuration","high volatility","time","center of gravity","north","better accessibility","paper","extremes","period","discussion"],"language":"en"},

The collection efficiency of a DBD reactor is an important factor for determining a reactor\u0027s removal efficiency.

One-pass removal tests of bioaerosols were carried out to deduce the inactivation efficiency of the DBD reactor using both aerosol- and colony-counting methods.

The impact of recently reported PED outbreaks in Asia and the USA seems to be more severe than what has been described in Europe. Infected animals, faeces, feed and objects contaminated with faeces are matrices that have been reported to transmit PEDV between farms.

Here, we report the development of a serologic assay for detection of antibodies to human coronaviruses (HCoVs) based on recombinant nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all known pathogenic strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS). The novel immunoassay is highly useful for epidemiologic surveys, where use of nucleic acid diagnostics often is limited. Purified recombinant antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and applied in a line immunoassay, which allows rapid detection of antibodies to 5 different HCoVs in a single experiment. For assay evaluation, serum samples from persons infected with 229E or OC43 (acute/convalescent), recovered SARS patients and healthy donors were analyzed. Screening for nucleocapsid (N)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in convalescent sera reached 100% sensitivity. With this new technique, we found that recently identified NL63 and HKU1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infections. Possibly, cross-reactive antibody responses were observed using 229E and OC43 serum pairs. However, the potential of this assay could clearly be demonstrated employing SARS-positive serum samples, where nonspecific binding to nucleocapsids of other HCoVs was not observed.

For many aspects of global health there is a dearth of research, yet evidence is urgently needed to address major challenges. Obtaining such data within a meaningful timeframe requires a fundamental change in the planning and setting up of research studies. Typically, protocols are developed in closed groups and often never shared. However, many operational processes in research are generic, irrespective of the disease or design. Thus, removal of duplication and sharing methods could speed up research. This research methodology project investigates whether researchers can be persuaded to share methods and if this will streamline research. Methods The theory of communities of practice (in which distinct specialists working on a problem collaborate to solve it) guided this project. The Global Health Network was created to enable communities of practice to form to develop protocols, exchange research instruments, and share skills. We measured uptake, effect, and benefit of the Network through surveys, questionnaires, interviews with target audiences (research teams in low-income and middle-income countries), and analysis of digital access. Findings Since 2011, more than 60 000 researchers, nurses, technicians, and scientists from almost all low-income and middle-income countries have used the project to share research methods, knowledge, and processes. 21 specialised communities of practice have formed collaborations that are actively exchanging methods. More than 250 research guidance notes have been shared that provide specific guidance for various research methods\u2014eg, an international respiratory disease network has released three open-access novel coronavirus protocols and groups working in maternal health are listing the samples they have stored with the invitation for others to collaborate. These qualitative and quantitative data show that these exchanges are highly beneficial for guiding and improving research operations, and that there is a willingness to share. Interpretation Scientists compete for funding and publication and therefore sharing methods and knowledge can be perceived as disadvantageous. However, if use of protocols and methods developed by wide and open consensus can help to quickly gain high quality data, then better progress could be made for all and disease research could be changed to improve health.

The broad spectrum of possible hosts suggests its potential for transmission from animal to person through close contact with pets. FPV thus serves as an example of the importance of new rapid point-of-care field diagnostic tools for the control and prevention of transmission, especially among rare wild animals and pet cats. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as a real-time and isothermal method, could be a more affordable alternative to PCR when combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) indicator. In this study, we report a novel FPV lateral flow dipstick RPA (LFD-RPA) instant detection method capable of detecting a range of different FPV strains. The LFD-RPA assay consists of specific primers, probe, and nucleic acid strip. It is capable of detecting 102 copies of target nucleic acid per reaction, which is one order of magnitude higher than the sensitivity of traditional PCR. The most suitable reaction conditions for this assay are at 38 \u2103 for 15 min.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel platform for the propagation of these types of viruses. Methods A platform for culturing human airway epithelia in a three-dimensional (3D) pattern using Matrigel as scaffold was developed. The features of 3D culture were identified by immunochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV in 3D cells at designated time points were quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Levels of cytokines, whose secretion was induced by the viruses, were measured by ELISA. Results Properties of bronchial-like tissues, such as the expression of biomarkers CK5, ZO-1, and PCK, and the development of cilium-like protuberances indicative of the human respiration tract, were observed in 3D-cultured human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, but not in monolayer-cultured cells. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV and levels of virus-induced cytokines were also measured using the 3D culture system.

The material traditionally used as vaccines is attenuated or inactivated pathogens. This approach is sometimes limited by the fact that the material for vaccination is not efficient, not available, or generating deleterious side effects. A possible theoretical alternative is the use of recombinant proteins from the pathogens. This implies that the proteins having the capacity to vaccinate have been identified and that they can be produced in sufficient quantity at a low cost. Genetically modified organisms harboring pathogen genes can fulfil these conditions. Microorganisms, animal cells as well as transgenic plants and animals can be the source of recombinant vaccines. Each of these systems that are all getting improved has advantages and limits. Adjuvants must generally be added to the recombinant proteins to enhance their vaccinating capacity. This implies that the proteins used to vaccinate have been purified to avoid any immunization against the contaminants. The efficiency of a recombinant vaccine is poorly predictable. Multiple proteins and various modes of administration must therefore be empirically evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The structure of the recombinant proteins, the composition of the adjuvants and the mode of administration of the vaccines have a strong and not fully predictable impact on the immune response as well as the protection level against pathogens. Recombinant proteins can theoretically also be used as carriers for epitopes from other pathogens. The increasing knowledge of pathogen genomes and the availability of efficient systems to prepare large amounts of recombinant proteins greatly facilitate the potential use of recombinant proteins as vaccines.

Pathogens may be transmitted directly from child to child via sneezing, coughing and touching, or indirectly via the environment. Toys are among the fomites with the highest pathogen load, but their role in disease transmission is unknown. Aim To determine if washing and disinfection of toys can reduce sickness absence and microbial pathogen load in the nursery environment. Methods Twelve nurseries (caring for 587 children) were randomized to intervention and control groups. The intervention consisted of washing and disinfection of toys and linen every two weeks for three months by a commercial cleaning company. The extent and causes of sickness absence among the children were recorded in both groups before and after introduction of the intervention. Ten sampling points in each nursery were examined for bacteria and respiratory viruses. Results The presence of respiratory virus DNA/RNA was widespread, but very few pathogenic bacteria were found in the environment. The intervention reduced the presence of adenovirus [odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1\u20135.0], rhinovirus (OR 5.3, 95% CI 2.3\u201312.4) and respiratory syncytial virus (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.5\u201311.2) compared with the control group, but the intervention had no effect on sickness absence or disease patterns in the nurseries. Conclusion Although cleaning and disinfection of toys every two weeks can decrease the microbial load in nurseries, it does not appear to reduce sickness absence among nursery children.","publish_time":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ibfelt, T.; Engelund, E.

METHODS: A descriptive analysis of MERS-CoV cases was conducted between January 23 and February 16, 2019. The data from officials and other published sources used. RESULTS: Thirteen laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported from three simultaneous clusters from two governorates without an epidemiological link between the clusters. Two clusters were reported from North Al Batinah Governorate, with nine cases (69%) and 1 cluster from South Ash Sharqiyah Governorate with four cases (31%). In total, four deaths were reported (case fatality rate 31%). Four cases (31%) reported were household contacts from the first cluster, 3 (23%) were nosocomial transmission in health care facilities (two for first and one from the second cluster) and 7 (54%) were community-acquired cases. CONCLUSIONS: The first local clusters of MERS-CoV reported with evidence suggestive of healthcare and household-associated transmission.

Previous work demonstrated that cells infected with vhs mutants display enhanced activation of the host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR), implying that vhs limits dsRNA accumulation in infected cells. Confirming this hypothesis, we show that partially complementary transcripts of the UL23/UL24 and UL30/31 regions of the viral genome increase in abundance when vhs is inactivated, giving rise to greatly increased levels of intracellular dsRNA formed by annealing of the overlapping portions of these RNAs. Thus, vhs limits accumulation of dsRNA at least in part by reducing the levels of complementary viral transcripts. We then asked if vhs also destabilizes dsRNA after its initial formation. Here, we used a reporter system employing two mCherry expression plasmids bearing complementary 3\u2019 UTRs to produce defined dsRNA species in uninfected cells. The dsRNAs are unstable, but are markedly stabilized by co-expressing the HSV dsRNA-binding protein US11. Strikingly, vhs delivered by super-infecting HSV virions accelerates the decay of these pre-formed dsRNAs in both the presence and absence of US11, a novel and unanticipated activity of vhs. Vhs binds the host RNA helicase eIF4A, and we find that vhs-induced dsRNA decay is attenuated by the eIF4A inhibitor hippuristanol, providing evidence that eIF4A participates in the process. Our results show that a herpesvirus host shutoff RNase destabilizes dsRNA in addition to targeting partially complementary viral mRNAs, raising the possibility that the mRNA destabilizing proteins of other viral pathogens dampen the host response to dsRNA through similar mechanisms.","publish_time":"2019-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dauber, Bianca; Saffran, Holly A.; Smiley, James R.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/128203cc9326a639b3d3c34d6b93dfd3c03a8d0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6821131.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626661/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vhs limits dsRNA accumulation","vhs limits accumulation of dsRNA","vhs-induced dsRNA decay","vhs mutants","defined dsRNA species","unanticipated activity of vhs","complementary viral mRNAs","host response","increased levels of intracellular dsRNA","HSV dsRNA-binding protein US11","levels of complementary viral transcripts","host RNA helicase eIF4A","viral pathogens","viral genome","complementary transcripts","herpesvirus host shutoff RNase","host double-stranded RNA","herpes simplex virus virion host shutoff","uninfected cells","eIF4A inhibitor hippuristanol","pre-formed dsRNAs","absence of US11","activated protein kinase R","super-infecting HSV virions","addition","UTRs","PKR","possibility","enhanced activation","mCherry expression plasmids","mRNA destabilizing proteins","UL24","presence","evidence","novel","reporter system","UL30","regions","UL23","rise","similar mechanisms","antiviral responses","results","abundance","overlapping portions","Previous work","initial formation","process","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Methods The risk of transmission of MERS-CoV infection to healthcare workers (HCWs) was assessed in an outbreak in Riyadh. All HCWs with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24h of exposure. Two negative results for MERS-CoV obtained 3days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to end the isolation of the HCWs and allow their return to duty. Results Overall 17 out of 879 HCWS with different levels of exposure tested positive for MERS-CoV. Of the 15 positive HCWS with adequate follow-up, 40% (6/15 HCWs) tested positive on the first sampling and 53% (8/15) tested positive on the second sampling. The time to negative results among the 15 positive HCWs ranged between 4 and 47days (average 14.5 days) and the infected HCWs needed on average two samples for clearance. All positive HCWs were either asymptomatic or had mild disease. Conclusions The data obtained in this study support the widespread testing of all close contacts of MERS-CoV cases, regardless of the significance of the contact or presence or absence of symptoms. In addition, urgent careful review of guidance regarding the return of asymptomatic MERS-CoV-positive HCWs under investigation to active duty is needed.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amer, Hala; Alqahtani, Abdulrahman S.; Alaklobi, Faisal; Altayeb, Juhaina; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/749b5b2d75829a833a403f68b673d40e1cceb8bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649550/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300833; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2018.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971218300833","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Riyadh"],"keyphrases":["positive HCWS","infected HCWs","MERS-CoV infection","return of asymptomatic MERS-CoV","CoV cases","days","close contacts of MERS","negative results","average","unprotected exposure","h of exposure","sampling","different levels of exposure","absence of symptoms","active duty","Abstract Objectives Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Saudi Arabia","emergency departments","urgent careful review of guidance","frequent hospital outbreaks","healthcare workers","investigation","initial site","widespread testing","risk of transmission","study","addition","presence","significance","samples","adequate follow-up","suggestive signs","Methods","mild disease","Conclusions","data","clearance","isolation","Riyadh","time"],"language":"en"},

Absence of SR-like RNA-binding protein Slr1 slows hyphal formation and decreases virulence in a systemic candidiasis model, suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation in these processes. SR (serine-arginine)-rich proteins influence multiple steps in mRNA metabolism and their localization and function are frequently controlled by modification. We now demonstrate that Slr1 binds to polyadenylated RNA and that its intracellular localization is modulated by phosphorylation and methylation. Wildtype Slr1-GFP is predominantly nuclear, but also co-fractionates with translating ribosomes. The non-phosphorylatable slr1-6SA-GFP protein, in which six serines in SR/RS clusters are substituted with alanines, primarily localizes to the cytoplasm in budding cells. Intriguingly, hyphal cells display an slr1-6SA-GFP focus at the tip near the Spitzenk\u00F6rper, a vesicular structure involved in molecular trafficking to the tip. The presence of slr1-6SA-GFP hyphal tip foci is reduced in the absence of the mRNA-transport protein She3, suggesting that unphosphorylated Slr1 associates with mRNA-protein complexes transported to the tip. The impact of SLR1 deletion on hyphal formation and function thus may be partially due to a role in hyphal mRNA transport.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ariyachet, Chaiyaboot; Bei\u00DFel, Christian; Li, Xiang; Lorrey, Selena; Mackenzie, Olivia; Martin, Patrick M.; O\u2019Brien, Katharine; Pholcharee, Tossapol; Sim, Sue; Krebber, Heike; McBride, Anne E.","journal":"Molecular Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29d9b8e642c9b67a204c0f18d846c34c49c25b76.json; document_parses/pdf_json/179b37ae6a8ca5b8483c5dfe2bb588beaea3821e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5405739.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/mmi.13643; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.13643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187496/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wildtype"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of slr1","Wildtype Slr1-GFP","hyphal formation","hyphal mRNA transport","hyphal cells","RNA-binding protein Slr1","SA-GFP protein","SA-GFP hyphal tip foci","hyphal growth","unphosphorylated Slr1 associates","impact of SLR1 deletion","non-phosphorylatable slr1","mRNA-protein complexes","mRNA-transport protein She3","SA-GFP focus","mRNA metabolism","Absence of SR","role","function","budding cells","polyadenylated RNA","intracellular localization","opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans","rich proteins","multiple steps","virulence","serines","systemic candidiasis model","morphological transition","vesicular structure","serine-arginine","post-transcriptional regulation","ability","RS clusters","molecular trafficking","Spitzenk\u00F6rper","disease","animal models","alanines","processes","phosphorylation","cytoplasm","translating ribosomes","methylation","modification"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to retrospectively assess the feasibility of detecting influenza cases based on fever screening as a sole measure. METHODS: Two datasets were collected at Narita International Airport during the 2009 pandemic. The first contained confirmed influenza cases (n = 16) whose diagnosis took place at the airport during the early stages of the pandemic, and the second contained a selected and suspected fraction of passengers (self-reported or detected by an infrared thermoscanner; n = 1,049) screened from September 2009 to January 2010. The sensitivity of fever (38.0\u00B0C) for detecting H1N1-2009 was estimated, and the diagnostic performances of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting hyperthermia at cut-off levels of 37.5\u00B0C, 38.0\u00B0C and 38.5\u00B0C were also estimated. RESULTS: The sensitivity of fever for detecting H1N1-2009 cases upon arrival was estimated to be 22.2% (95% confidence interval: 0, 55.6) among nine confirmed H1N1-2009 cases, and 55.6% of the H1N1-2009 cases were under antipyretic medications upon arrival. The sensitivity and specificity of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting hyperthermia ranged from 50.8-70.4% and 63.6-81.7%, respectively.

Cryptosporidium, E. intestinalis, CMV, MAC, and other infections can be identified by intestinal biopsy quicker and often at lower overall cost than they can be by culture.","publish_time":"1998-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koch, Johannes; Owen, Robert L.","journal":"Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105251571830237X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S105251571830237X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fungal pathogens","mucosal lesions","ingested potential pathogens","active mucosal immunity","blood fail","severe impairment of immunoregulatory lymphocytes","proliferation of protozoal","direct contact","responsible organisms","AIDS","endoscopy","intestinal biopsy quicker","lower overall cost","noninvasive tests of stool","CMV","infections","diarrhea","invasion","MAC","small intestine","patients","damage"],"language":"en"},

Multiplexing would allow their cost to be spread over multiple targets, but often only with lower sensitivity and accuracy, noise, false positives, and false negatives; these arise by interactions between the multiple nucleic acid primers and probes in a multiplexed kit. Here we offer a multiplexed assay for a panel of respiratory viruses that mitigates these problems by combining several nucleic acid analogs from the emerging field of synthetic biology: (i) self-avoiding molecular recognition systems (SAMRSs), which facilitate multiplexing, and (ii) artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs), which enable low-noise PCR. These are supplemented by \u201Ctransliteration\u201D technology, which converts standard nucleotides in a target to AEGIS nucleotides in a product, improving hybridization.

It presents with a barky cough, stridor and hoarseness occurring secondary to inflammation of the subglottis and larynx. The clinical course of croup is well-described, however atypical presentations pose a diagnostic and management challenge. Objectives This case report and systematic review aims to synthesize the published literature on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of atypical croup. Study selection Peer-reviewed journal publications in Ovid MEDLINE\u00AE and EMBASE from inception to January 1, 2019 in English, focusing on pediatric patients (\u003C18 years of age) with diagnoses of atypical croup. Data extraction Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Twelve studies involving 670 patients ranging from 6 months to 11 years of age presenting with atypical croup were selected. A variety of definitions of atypical croup were identified based on recurrence, duration of symptoms, severity, and etiology. Data on the incidence of atypical croup, the overall rates of intubation and tracheostomy, and patient characteristics leading to definitive airway management were not clearly characterized. Limitations All studies were case series, case reports or retrospective chart reviews. Conclusions Atypical croup is a poorly defined clinical entity that is used to describe recurrent, refractory, or croup-like illness that follows an uncharacteristic natural history. Our case presentation and accompanying literature review highlights the variable, but limited, information available on the diagnosis of atypical croup. Given the commonality of its use in clinical practice, we propose some guidelines around the use of the term \u2018atypical croup\u2019 as well as a management algorithm.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanna, Raphael; Lee, Francisco; Drummond, Derek; Yunker, Warren K.","journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/297ed82fbc924a17639deb479ac1ffb63d021fc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112844.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587619304392; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587619304392; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2019.109686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of atypical croup","incidence of atypical croup","treatment of atypical croup","diagnoses of atypical croup","Conclusions Atypical croup","atypical presentations","clinical course of croup","Abstract Background Croup","case series","case reports","case presentation","Systematic Reviews","years of age","clinical practice","guidelines","studies","use","management challenge","management algorithm","accompanying literature review","defined clinical entity","definitive airway management","published literature","pediatric patients","retrospective chart reviews","common respiratory illness","Data extraction Preferred Reporting Items","Ovid MEDLINE","Meta-Analyses","Study selection Peer-reviewed journal publications","patient characteristics","overall rates of intubation","inflammation","stridor","hoarseness","tracheostomy","variable","PRISMA","recurrence","information available","severity","inception","EMBASE","Objectives","term","duration of symptoms","barky cough","subglottis","English","uncharacteristic natural history","children","commonality","Limitations","months","refractory","variety of definitions","larynx","etiology","Results"],"language":"en"},

Patients younger than 18 years of age, with end stage kidney disease or with a kidney transplant were excluded. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. Of 5,449 patients admitted with Covid-19, AKI developed in 1,993 (36.6%). The peak stages of AKI were stage 1 in 46.5%, stage 2 in 22.4% and stage 3 in 31.1%. Of these, 14.3% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). AKI was primarily seen in Covid-19 patients with respiratory failure, with 89.7% of patients on mechanical ventilation developing AKI compared to 21.7% of non-ventilated patients. 276/285 (96.8%) of patients requiring RRT were on ventilators. Of patients who required ventilation and developed AKI, 52.2% had the onset of AKI within 24 hours of intubation. Risk factors for AKI included older age, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, black race, hypertension and need for ventilation and vasopressor medications. Among patients with AKI, 694 died (35%), 519 (26%) were discharged and 780 (39%) were still hospitalized. AKI occurs frequently among patients with Covid-19 disease. It occurs early and in temporal association with respiratory failure and is associated with a poor prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirsch, Jamie S.; Ng, Jia H.; Ross, Daniel W.; Sharma, Purva; Shah, Hitesh H.; Barnett, Richard L.; Hazzan, Azzour D.; Fishbane, Steven; Jhaveri, Kenar D.","journal":"Kidney international","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/005dba06f91557922b8397a2702448bcf9d58fb0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253820305329; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416116/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820305329?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AKI","KDIGO","RRT"],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["outcomes of AKI","developed AKI","onset of AKI","Patients younger","Covid","peak stages of AKI","non-ventilated patients","end stage kidney disease","associated outcomes","cardiovascular disease","risk factors","kidney transplant","respiratory failure","mechanical ventilation","RRT","older age","years of age","rate of acute kidney injury","diabetes mellitus","black race","hypertension","community hospitals","metropolitan New York","temporal association","presentation","renal replacement therapy","study","vasopressor medications","hours of intubation","health records","KDIGO criteria","ventilators","poor prognosis"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, six CHIKV isolates (2006 RGCB03, RGCB05; 2007 RGCB80, RGCB120; 2008 RGCB355, RGCB356) from three consecutive Chikungunya outbreaks in Kerala, South India, were analyzed for genetic variations by sequencing the 11798 bp whole genome of the virus. A total of 37 novel mutations were identified and they were predominant in the 2007 and 2008 isolates among the six isolates studied. The previously identified E1 A226V critical mutation, which enhances mosquito adaptability, was present in the 2007 and 2008 samples. An important observation was the presence of two coding region substitutions, leading to nsP2 L539S and E2 K252Q change. These were identified in three isolates (2007 RGCB80 and RGCB120; 2008 RGCB355) by full-genome analysis, and also in 13 of the 31 additional samples (42%), obtained from various parts of the state, by sequencing the corresponding genomic regions. These mutations showed 100% co-occurrence in all these samples. In phylogenetic analysis, formation of a new genetic clade by these isolates within the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotypes was observed. Homology modeling followed by mapping revealed that at least 20 of the identified mutations fall into functionally significant domains of the viral proteins and are predicted to affect protein structure. Eighteen of the identified mutations in structural proteins, including the E2 K252Q change, are predicted to disrupt T-cell epitope immunogenicity.

The innate immune system forms the first line of defense against pathogenic organisms like these and is responsible for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Viral RNA is a potent inducer of antiviral innate immune signaling, provoking an antiviral state by directing expression of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, \u002BRNA viruses developed various methods to avoid detection and downstream signaling, including isolation of viral RNA replication in membranous viral replication organelles (ROs). These structures therefore play a central role in infection, and consequently, loss of RO integrity might simultaneously result in impaired viral replication and enhanced antiviral signaling. This review summarizes the first indications that the innate immune system indeed has tools to disrupt viral ROs and other non- or aberrant-self membrane structures, and may do this by marking these membranes with proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and ubiquitin, resulting in the recruitment of IFN-inducible GTPases. Further studies should evaluate whether this process forms a general effector mechanism in \u002BRNA virus infection, thereby creating the opportunity for development of novel antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scutigliani, Enzo Maxim; Kikkert, Marjolein","journal":"Cytokine \u0026 Growth Factor Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8782deab94c366e223e7a6307c1e002ed6cf1c21.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108334.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610117300667; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610117300667; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2017.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","RO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","isolation of viral RNA replication","viral ROs","impaired viral replication","RNA virus infection","positive-strand RNA","innate immune system","membranous viral replication organelles","antiviral state","enhanced antiviral","potent inducer of antiviral innate immune","development of novel antiviral therapies","microtubule-associated protein","host-pathogen interactions","aberrant-self membrane structures","opportunity","general effector mechanism","IFNs","expression of interferons","line of defense","need","tools","LC3","pathogenic organisms","process","B-light chain","proteins","detection","various methods","indications","pro-inflammatory cytokines","recruitment of IFN","molecular patterns","loss of RO integrity","inducible GTPases","ubiquitin","potential health risks","PAMPs","central role","membranes","studies","review"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, the design of an effective and safe anti-H5N1 vaccine is essential. We previously demonstrated that the full-length hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) could induce significant neutralizing antibody response and protection. Here, we intended to identify the critical neutralizing domain (CND) in an optimal conformation that can elicit strong cross-neutralizing antibodies and protection against divergent H5N1 strains. We thus constructed six recombinant proteins covering different regions of HA1 of A/Anhui/1/2005(H5N1), each of which was fused with foldon (Fd) and Fc of human IgG. We found that the critical fragment fused with Fd/Fc (HA-13\u2013263-Fdc, H5 numbering) that could elicit the strongest neutralizing antibody response is located in the N-terminal region of HA1 (residues 13\u2013263), which covers the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 112\u2013263). We then constructed three additional recombinants fused with Fd plus His tag (HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His), Fc only (HA-13\u2013263-Fc), and His tag only (HA-13\u2013263-His), respectively. We found that the HA-13\u2013263-Fdc, which formed an oligomeric conformation, induced the strongest neutralizing antibody response and cross-protection against challenges of two tested H5N1 virus strains covering clade 1: A/VietNam/1194/2004 (VN/1194) or clade 2.3.4: A/Shenzhen/406H/06 (SZ/406H), while HA-13\u2013263-Fc dimer and HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His trimer elicited higher neutralizing antibody response and protection than HA-13\u2013263-His monomer. These results suggest that the oligomeric form of the CND containing the RBD can be further developed as an effective and safe vaccine for cross-protection against divergent strains of H5N1 viruses.","publish_time":"2013-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Sun, Shihui; Zhang, Xiujuan; Zhou, Xiaojun; Guo, Yan; Li, Ye; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d5fdcbc3c2b82ecef0748012b73fc1aa7a2ad96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3539987.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23320093/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053568","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":["CND"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cross-protection","strongest neutralizing antibody response","divergent H5N1 strains","higher neutralizing antibody response","significant neutralizing antibody response","divergent strains of H5N1 viruses","critical neutralizing domain","safe anti-H5N1 vaccine","tested H5N1 virus strains","Fc dimer","laboratory-generated H5N1 mutants","strong cross","Fc of human IgG","safe vaccine","CND","oligomeric conformation","clade","RBD","residues","Fdc","tag","different regions of HA1","optimal conformation","N-terminal region of HA1","oligomeric form","critical fragment","receptor-binding domain","challenges","antibodies","HPAI","trimer","pathogenic avian influenza","species barrier","recombinant proteins","potential","mammals","humans","design","Anhui","H5 numbering","additional recombinants","VietNam","VN","results","full-length hemagglutinin","SZ","Shenzhen","foldon","monomer"],"language":"en"},

Since its discovery in Trinidad in 1954, cases of MAYV infection have largely been confined there and to the northern countries of South America, but recently, MAYV cases have been reported in some island nations in the Caribbean Sea. Accompanying these reports is evidence that new vectors, including Aedes spp. mosquitos, recently implicated in the global spread of Zika and chikungunya viruses, are competent for MAYV transmission, which, if true, could facilitate the spread of MAYV beyond its current range. Despite its status as an emerging virus, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent MAYV infection nor therapeutics to treat it. Here, we describe the development and testing of a novel DNA vaccine, scMAYV-E, that encodes a synthetically-designed consensus MAYV envelope sequence. In vivo electroporation-enhanced immunization of mice with this vaccine induced potent humoral responses including neutralizing antibodies as well as robust T-cell responses to multiple epitopes in the MAYV envelope. Importantly, these scMAYV-E-induced immune responses protected susceptible mice from morbidity and mortality following a MAYV challenge.","publish_time":"2019-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Hyeree; Kudchodkar, Sagar B.; Reuschel, Emma L.; Asija, Kanika; Borole, Piyush; Ho, Michelle; Wojtak, Krzysztof; Reed, Charles; Ramos, Stephanie; Bopp, Nathen E.; Aguilar, Patricia V.; Weaver, Scott C.; Kim, J.

They are becoming more widely used than the classical virological assays in the majority of clinical virology laboratories, and now represent a new method for the diagnosis of human viral infections. Recently, new techniques based on multiplex RT-PCR amplification followed by microarray analysis have been developed and evaluated. On the basis of amplification of viral genome-specific fragments by multiplex RT-PCR and their subsequent detection via hybridization with microorganism-specific binding probes on solid surfaces, they allow simultaneous detection and identification of multiple viruses in a single clinical sample. The management of viral central nervous system and respiratory tract infections currently represents the two main applications of the microarrays in routine virological practice. Microarrays have shown reliable results in comparison with those of referenced (RT)-PCR assays, and appear to be of major interest for the detection of a broad range of respiratory and neurotropic viruses, assessment of the pathogenicity of newly discovered or neglected viruses, and identification of multiple viral infections in clinical samples. Despite several limitations observed during the different studies performed, this new technology might improve the clinical management of patients by enlarging the range of the viruses detected, in particular in cases of severe infections leading to patient hospitalization in the intensive-care unit. They might also help in the prevention of nosocomial transmission in hospital departments by contributing to the development of new epidemiological surveillance systems for viral infections.","publish_time":"2014-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u011Bv\u011Bque, N.; Renois, F.; Andr\u00E9oletti, L.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fd1e4df8c0178b9de4dc10785cef2d7051a94a8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a566bb8905d3dc74c553d3885a8b7b3bffb67c42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129321.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14603037; https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14603037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23034051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of multiple viral infections","viral testing","diagnosis of human viral infections","new techniques","identification of multiple viruses","respiratory tract infections","viral genome-specific fragments","neurotropic viruses","neglected viruses","multiplex RT-PCR amplification","new technology","new method","PCR assays","clinical samples","cases of severe infections","clinical management of patients","management of viral central nervous system","simultaneous detection","subsequent detection","single clinical sample","microarrays","development of new epidemiological surveillance systems","majority of clinical virology laboratories","broad range of respiratory","classical virological assays","rapid development","basis of amplification","Molecular diagnostic techniques","routine virological practice","microorganism-specific binding probes","hybridization","solid surfaces","patient hospitalization","pathogenicity","hospital departments","assessment","main applications","prevention of nosocomial transmission","different studies","comparison","intensive-care unit","recent years","microarray analysis","reliable results","limitations"],"language":"en"},

The displayed antigens are then used for the detection of the target antibody, with the yeast cells as fluorescent labels. Multiplex immunoassay can be readily realized by using yeast cells expressing different intracellular fluorescent proteins to display different antigens. The implementation of this YSD-based immunoassay on the microfluidic platform eliminates the need for the bulky, complex and expensive flow cytometer. To improve the detection sensitivity and to eliminate the need for pumping, a functionalized micro pillar array (MPA) is incorporated in the microfluidic chip, resulting in a detection limit of 5 ng/mL (or 1 ng in terms of amount) and enhanced compatibility with practical applications such as clinical biopsy. This new platform has a high potential to be integrated into microfluidic detection systems to enable portable diagnostics in the future.","publish_time":"2012-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jing; Cheng, Danhui; Chan, Jay Kwok-Lun; Luo, Xiaoteng; Wu, Hongkai; Hsing, I-Ming","journal":"Sens Actuators B Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df8312911c54f2485bfb2edc4cab11c92d55c180.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5d68a06a89d1de979b9c8f49e054b79490081b85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127699.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288242/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400512001815; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925400512001815; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.02.048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YSD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microfluidic platform","microfluidic detection systems","new microfluidic immunoassay platform","microfluidic chip","microfluidic technology","yeast surface display","YSD-based immunoassay","surface of engineered yeast cells","YSD technique","different antigens","new platform","detection limit","detection sensitivity","displayed antigens","different intracellular fluorescent proteins","need","fluorescent labels","target antibody","antigens specific","Multiplex immunoassay","functionalized micro pillar array","practical applications","pumping","portable diagnostics","enhanced compatibility","high potential","expensive flow cytometer","synergistic combination","clinical biopsy","terms","implementation","future","paper"],"language":"en"},

As a result there has been huge interest in ACE2 over the past decade as a potential therapeutic for lowering blood pressure, especially elevation resulting from excess Ang II. Studies focusing on ACE2 have helped to reveal other actions of Ang-(1-7), outside vasodilation, such as antifibrotic and antiproliferative effects. Moreover, investigations focusing on ACE2 have revealed a variety of roles not just catalytic but also as a viral receptor and amino acid transporter. This paper focuses on what is known about ACE2 and its biological roles, paying particular attention to the regulation of ACE2 expression.

We then evaluate the local importance of nodes in communities, and show that immunizing nodes with high local importance can remarkably suppress the epidemic. More interestingly, we find that high local importance but non-central nodes play a big role in epidemic spreading process, removing them improves the immunization efficiency by 25% to 150% at different scenarios.","publish_time":"2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Peiyan; Tang, Shaojie","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ac495bc3644fff725ad9da58c2891f193f4569e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127625.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288091/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2014.10.087; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843711400942X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037843711400942X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OSN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic spreading","local importance of nodes","immunizing nodes","epidemic dynamics","outbreak of epidemic","non-central nodes","Abstract Immunizing important nodes","different communities","high local importance","effect of community","evolution of community structure","based immunization strategy","different scenarios","implementation of control strategy","temporal community feature of opportunistic social networks","OSN traces","immunization efficiency","big role","process","biased understanding","effective solution","studies","paper"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: Provide evidence on the effect of implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics for viruses on use of in-hospital isolation facilities, oseltamivir and antibiotic usage, and other clinical outcomes in immunocompromised patients. STUDY DESIGN: A before-after study during two consecutive respiratory viral seasons, including immunocompromised adult patients presenting at a tertiary care emergency department with clinical suspicion of RTI. During the first season (2016/2017), respiratory viruses were detected using inhouse real-time PCR. The second season (2017/2018), we implemented a diagnostic flowchart including a rapid molecular test for 15 respiratory viruses (FilmArray\u00AE). We assessed the effect of this implementation on need for isolation, antivirals and empirical antibiotics. RESULTS: We included 192 immunocompromised adult patients during the first and 378 during the second season. Respiratory viral testing was performed in 135 patients (70%) during the first and 284 (75%) during the second season (p = 0.218) of which 213 (75%) using the rapid test. After implementation, use of in-hospital isolation facilities was reduced (adjusted odds ratio 0.35, 95%CI 0.19-0.64). Furthermore, adequate use of oseltamivir improved, with fewer prescriptions in influenza negative patients (0.15, 95%CI 0.08-0.28) and more in influenza positive patients (11.13, 95%CI 1.75\u201370.86). No effect was observed on empirical antibiotic use, hospital admissions, length of hospital stay or safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in adult immunocompromised patients results in more adequate use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities without compromising safety.","publish_time":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vos, Laura M.; Weehuizen, Jesper M.; Hoepelman, Andy I.M.; Kaasjager, Karin H.A.H.; Riezebos-Brilman, Annelies; Oosterheert, Jan Jelrik","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5896010c0e29c9cfb0c8403ab75f344a359769f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185605.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219300770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999234/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219300770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","immunocompromised adult patients","adult immunocompromised patients","hospital isolation facilities","Respiratory viral testing","effect of implementation","adequate use of oseltamivir","influenza negative patients","influenza positive patients","Implementation of rapid molecular testing","length of hospital","hospital admissions","empirical antibiotic use","Immunocompromised adults","rapid test","consecutive respiratory viral seasons","rapid molecular diagnostics","complicated course of viral respiratory tract infections","clinical outcomes","safety outcomes","RESULTS","clinical suspicion of RTI","antibiotic usage","empirical antibiotics","STUDY DESIGN","tertiary care emergency department","fewer prescriptions","antivirals","adjusted odds ratio","need","diagnostic flowchart","CONCLUSIONS","inhouse real-time PCR","BACKGROUND","evidence","FilmArray","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Strikingly, infection of mice lacking PLA(2)G2D expression (Pla2g2d(\u2212/\u2212) mice) converted a uniformly lethal infection to a nonlethal one (\u003E80% survival), subsequent to development of enhanced respiratory DC migration to the draining lymph nodes, augmented antivirus T cell responses, and diminished lung damage. We also observed similar effects in influenza A virus\u2013infected middle-aged Pla2g2d(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Furthermore, oxidative stress, probably via lipid peroxidation, was found to induce PLA(2)G2D expression in mice and in human monocyte\u2013derived macrophages.

Since it is dispensable for HCV RNA replication, the non-structural viral protein NS2 is suggested to play a central role in HCV particle assembly. However, despite genetic evidences, we have almost no understanding about NS2 protein-protein interactions and their role in the production of infectious particles. Here, we used co-immunoprecipitation and/or fluorescence resonance energy transfer with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy analyses to study the interactions between NS2 and the viroporin p7 and the HCV glycoprotein E2. In addition, we used alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis as well as other mutations in the context of an infectious virus to investigate the functional role of NS2 in HCV assembly. Finally, the subcellular localization of NS2 and several mutants was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Our data demonstrate molecular interactions between NS2 and p7 and E2. Furthermore, we show that, in the context of an infectious virus, NS2 accumulates over time in endoplasmic reticulum-derived dotted structures and colocalizes with both the envelope glycoproteins and components of the replication complex in close proximity to the HCV core protein and lipid droplets, a location that has been shown to be essential for virus assembly. We show that NS2 transmembrane region is crucial for both E2 interaction and subcellular localization. Moreover, specific mutations in core, envelope proteins, p7 and NS5A reported to abolish viral assembly changed the subcellular localization of NS2 protein. Together, these observations indicate that NS2 protein attracts the envelope proteins at the assembly site and it crosstalks with non-structural proteins for virus assembly.","publish_time":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popescu, Costin-Ioan; Callens, Nathalie; Trinel, Dave; Roingeard, Philippe; Moradpour, Darius; Descamps, V\u00E9ronique; Duverlie, Gilles; Penin, Fran\u00E7ois; H\u00E9liot, Laurent; Rouill\u00E9, Yves; Dubuisson, Jean","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bff285847e6573b613d937df23f57355afcbd5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3037360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347350/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV RNA","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS2 protein-protein interactions","HCV assembly","subcellular localization of NS2 protein","virus assembly","non-structural viral protein NS2","HCV core protein","functional role of NS2","HCV particle assembly","viral assembly","NS2 transmembrane region","infectious virus","envelope proteins","assembly site","HCV glycoprotein E2","HCV RNA replication","non-structural proteins of hepatitis C virus","envelope glycoproteins","molecular interactions","viroporin p7","central role","E2 interaction","addition","context","production of infectious particles","replication complex","specific mutations","confocal microscopy","fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy analyses","physical virion components","fluorescence resonance energy transfer","close proximity","endoplasmic reticulum-derived dotted structures","colocalizes","crosstalks","lipid droplets","mutants","NS5A","understanding","alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis","co-immunoprecipitation","location","data","experimental evidence","observations","genetic evidences","orchestrating morphogenesis"],"language":"en"},

Such an approach presents important opportunities to reduce the impact of disease emergence events and also to mitigate future emergence through improved cross-sectoral coordination. In an attempt to provide proof of concept of the utility of the One Health approach, the US Agency for International Development\u2019s PREDICT project consortium designed and implemented a targeted, risk-based surveillance strategy based not on humans as sentinels of disease but on detecting viruses early, at their source, where intervention strategies can be implemented before there is opportunity for spillover and spread in people or food animals. Here, we share One Health approaches used by consortium members to illustrate the potential for successful One Health outcomes that can be achieved through collaborative, transdisciplinary partnerships. PREDICT\u2019s collaboration with partners around the world on strengthening local capacity to detect hundreds of viruses in wild animals, coupled with a series of cutting-edge virological and analytical activities, have significantly improved our baseline knowledge on the zoonotic pool of viruses and the risk of exposure to people. Further testament to the success of the project\u2019s One Health approach and the work of its team of dedicated One Health professionals are the resulting 90 peer-reviewed, scientific publications in under 5 years that improve our understanding of zoonoses and the factors influencing their emergence. The findings are assisting in global health improvements, including surveillance science, diagnostic technologies, understanding of viral evolution, and ecological driver identification.

We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic.

Unfortunately, it is both time-consuming and costly to determine the SNO sites purely based on biological experiments. Facing the explosive protein sequence data generated in the post-genomic era, we are challenged to develop automated vehicles for timely and effectively determining the SNO sites for uncharacterized proteins. To address the challenge, a new predictor called iSNO-AAPair was developed by taking into account the coupling effects for all the pairs formed by the nearest residues and the pairs by the next nearest residues along protein chains. The cross-validation results on a state-of-the-art benchmark have shown that the new predictor outperformed the existing predictors. The same was true when tested by the independent proteins whose experimental SNO sites were known.

METHODS: A probability-based sample of 1,076 migrant and 1,195 local women were included in the study. A pre-tested field questionnaire was administered to participants through a direct face-to-face interview. Questionnaire contained questions on socio-demographic information, AIDS and STDs prevalence information and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) which measures objective support, subjective support, and utilization of social support. RESULTS: Compared to local women, married migrant women had lower levels of social support in most dimensions. Multi-variable analysis revealed that relationship with spouse, family average income, number of children, education, engagement and claimed reasons of moving have various correlations with one or all dimensions of social support scores. Higher social support is also related to awareness of infection status of HIV and STDs among this group. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide further evidence that married migrant women have lower levels of social support which may be related to some social characteristics and their awareness status of AIDS and STDs infection status and that targeted interventions need to be developed for this population.","publish_time":"2015-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Wenkang; Kang, Dianmin; Song, Yapei; Wei, Chongyi; Marley, Gifty; Ma, Wei","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dde2f725f681ca3d6af28e816b5b58db9fe56551.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4658759.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603036/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2508-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Social Support"],"locations":["Shandong"],"keyphrases":["social support level","social support condition","utilization of social support","Higher social support","lower levels of social support","objective support","subjective support","dimensions of social support scores","married migrant women","Social Support Rating Scale","social characteristics","non-migrant local women","STDs infection status","infection status of AIDS","awareness status of AIDS","STDs prevalence information","awareness of infection status of HIV","group","study","socio-demographic information","increasing population of marriage","probability-based sample","pre-tested field questionnaire","comparison","Shandong province","relationship","spouse","number of children","family average income","relevant factors","participants","rural areas","SSRS","education","evidence","reasons","engagement","questions","targeted interventions","Multi-variable analysis","China","direct face-to-face interview","METHODS","various correlations","BACKGROUND","findings","critical role","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

While the interdependences, similarities and complementarities of manufacturing and services are significant, there are considerable differences between goods and services, including the shift in focus from mass production to mass customization (whereby a service is produced and delivered in response to a customer\u2019s stated or imputed needs). In general, services can be considered to be knowledge-intensive agents or components which work together as providers and consumers to create or co-produce value. Like manufacturing systems, an efficient service system must be an integrated system of systems, leading to greater connectivity and interdependence. Integration must occur over the physical, temporal, organizational and functional dimensions, and must include methods concerned with the component, the management, and the system. Moreover, an effective service system must also be an adaptable system, leading to greater value and responsiveness. Adaptation must occur over the dimensions of monitoring, feedback, cybernetics and learning, and must include methods concerned with space, time, and system. In sum, service systems are indeed complex, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the human-centered aspects of such systems. Moreover, the system complexities can only be dealt with methods that enhance system integration and adaptation. The paper concludes with several insights, including a plea to shift the current misplaced focus on developing a science or discipline for services to further developing a systems engineering approach to services, an approach based on the integration and adaptation of a host of sciences or disciplines (e.g., physics, mathematics, statistics, psychology, sociology, etc.). In fact, what is required is a services-related transdisciplinary - beyond a single disciplinary - ontology or taxonomy as a basis for disciplinary integration and adaptation.","publish_time":"2008-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tien, James M.","journal":"J Syst Sci Syst Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a95d0b900f53eb77dd655e717cd1787b73e8c822.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11518-008-5087-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["system integration","integrated system of systems","service systems","adaptable system","system complexities","efficient service system","effective service system","services sector","Adaptation","manufacturing systems","services-related transdisciplinary","methods","disciplinary integration","systems engineering approach","greater value","shift","mass production","mass customization","complementarities of manufacturing","functional dimensions","dimensions of monitoring","greater connectivity","current misplaced focus","single disciplinary - ontology","co-produce value","taxonomy","growing proportion of workers","mathematics","physics","basis","considerable differences","components","customer\u2019s stated","statistics","psychology","disciplines","industrialized nations","consumers","plea","feedback","cybernetics","temporal","learning","response","host of sciences","goods","similarities","human-centered aspects","imputed needs","knowledge-intensive agents","information","communication technologies","providers","sociology","uncertainties","interdependences","space","time","insights","responsiveness","management","paper"],"language":"en"},

However, the role of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway during the acute phase of infections has not been well characterized. In the current study the effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 deficiency on the CD8(\u002B) T cell response against Friend retroviral (FV) infection of knockout mice was analyzed during acute infection. We observed an enhanced proliferation, functional maturation, and reduced apoptosis of effector CD8(\u002B) T cells in the absence of PD-1 or PD-L1. The knockout of PD-L1 had a stronger effect on the functionality of CD8(\u002B) T cells than that of PD-1. Augmented CTL responses were associated with an improved control of FV replication. The strong phenotype of FV-infected PD-L1 knockout mice was independent of the interaction with CD80 as an additional receptor for PD-L1. Furthermore, we performed a detailed analysis of the production of different granzymes in virus-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells and observed that especially the simultaneous production of multiple granzymes in individual T cells (multifunctionality) was under the control of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of viral\u2010associated pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis and failure to improve forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV (1)) after an appropriate treatment. METHODS: We lead a pilot study from January 2009 until March 2013. Children with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis were longitudinally evaluated three times: at baseline (Visit 1), at the diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation (Visit 2), and after exacerbation treatment (Visit 3). Nasal and bronchial samples were analyzed at each visit with multiplex viral respiratory PCR panel (qualitative detection of 16 viruses). Pulmonary function tests were recorded at each visit, in order to highlight a possible failure to improve them after treatment. Lack of improvement was defined by an increase in FEV (1) less than 5% between Visit 2 and Visit 3. RESULTS: Eighteen children were analyzed in the study. 10 patients failed to improve by more than 5% their FEV (1) between Visit 2 and Visit 3. Rhinovirus infection at Visit 2 or Visit 3 was the only risk factor significantly associated with such a failure (OR, 12; 95% CI, 1\u00B73\u2013111\u00B73), P = 0\u00B703. CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus infection seems to play a role in the FEV (1) recovery after pulmonary exacerbation treatment in children with cystic fibrosis. Such an association needs to be confirmed by a large\u2010scale study because this finding may have important implications for pulmonary exacerbation management.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cousin, Mathias; Molinari, Nicolas; Foulongne, Vincent; Caimmi, Davide; Vachier, Isabelle; Abely, Michel; Chiron, Raphael","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71ff6abe3023a4c48fd6e6c54265bce395b88397.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4746558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26493783/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12353","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Visit","pulmonary exacerbation treatment","pulmonary exacerbations","children","diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation","FEV","pulmonary exacerbation management","diagnosis of cystic fibrosis","Pulmonary function tests","appropriate treatment","large\u2010scale study","pilot study","Respiratory viral infections","impact of viral","possible failure","Rhinovirus infection","patients","multiplex viral respiratory PCR panel","bronchial inflammation","bronchial samples","qualitative detection","important implications","finding","recovery","expiratory volume","times","viruses","BACKGROUND","role","order","increase","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","baseline","Lack of improvement","association needs","risk factor","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to assess the awareness of COVID-19 disease and related infection control practices among healthcare professionals and students in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Materials and methods A total of 1562 responders from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region completed a questionnaire-based survey on the awareness, knowledge, and infection control practices related to COVID-19 infection in the healthcare setting. The questionnaire was adapted from the current interim guidance and information for healthcare workers published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Convenient sampling method was used for data collection and the distribution of responses was presented as frequencies and percentages. Descriptive statistics were performed for all groups and subgroups based on the percentage of correct responses. Individual pairwise comparisons were done using the median test for the percentage of correct responses. Results The overall awareness for all subgroups was adequate with 71.2% reporting correct answers. The highest percentage of correct responses were from undergraduate medical students and the lowest was from non-clinical/administrative staff. Less than half of the total respondents could correctly define \u201Cclose contact.\u201D More than three-fourths of the responders were aware of the various infection control measures like rapid triage, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette and having a separate, well ventilated waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients. However, only 45.4% of the responders were aware of the correct sequence for the application of a mask/respirator, and only 52.5% of the responders were aware of the preferred hand hygiene method for visibly soiled hands.

The microbicidal effect is mainly due to silver ions, which have a wide antibacterial spectrum. Furthermore, the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria, as in the case of antibiotics, is less likely. Silver ions bind to halide ions, such as chloride, and precipitate; therefore, when used directly, their microbicidal activity is shortened. To overcome this issue, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been recently synthesized and frequently used as microbicidal agents that release silver ions from particle surface. Depending on the specific surface area of the nanoparticles, silver ions are released with high efficiency. In addition to their bactericidal activity, small Ag NPs (\u003C10 nm in diameter) affect viruses although the microbicidal effect of silver mass is weak. Because of their characteristics, Ag NPs are useful countermeasures against infectious diseases, which constitute a major issue in the medical field. Thus, medical tools coated with Ag NPs are being developed. This review outlines the synthesis and utilization of Ag NPs in the medical field, focusing on environment-friendly synthesis and the suppression of infections in healthcare workers (HCWs).","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakamura, Shingo; Sato, Masahiro; Sato, Yoko; Ando, Naoko; Takayama, Tomohiro; Fujita, Masanori; Ishihara, Masayuki","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3adfcb05fa2004182d3c232a69429d2b1adfe12f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6695748.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344881/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20153620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["silver ions","silver nanoparticles","microbicidal effect of silver mass","small Ag NPs","utilization of Ag NPs","microbicidal activity","halide ions","microbicidal agents","medical field","medical tools","major issue","bactericidal activity","particle surface","environment-friendly synthesis","specific surface area","suppression of infections","infectious diseases","useful countermeasures","viruses","resistant bacteria","healthcare workers","diameter","characteristics","adverse effects","human body","case of antibiotics","development of multidrug","HCWs","addition","chloride","wide antibacterial spectrum","high efficiency","review","precipitate"],"language":"en"},

The response to the Swine flu pandemic has been ambivalent, both on the societal (political) and the scientific level. While some scientists warned against potential massive loss of human lives and urged for immediate and large-scale vaccination, others accused them of unnecessary scaremongering, arguing that the pandemic would not be that severe. The lab-created virulent Avian flu virus \u2013 which has been created in order to \u2018fight\u2019 a potential Avian flu pandemic \u2013 sparked a fierce debate on the dual-use risks of such a pre-emptive strategy. This article involves an analysis of the medical-political response to these recent viral threats using Peter Sloterdijk\u0027s immunological framework as diagnostic tool. In his trilogy Spheres Sloterdijk uses immunological concepts to analyse and assess the contemporary biopolitical situation. It shows how drawing a parallel between the functioning of the biological immune system and \u201Cimmune responses\u201D on socio-political level enables to assess and reconceptualise biosecurity. It demonstrates that ideas such as \u201Cnature is the biggest terrorist\u201D \u2013 as advanced by many virologists \u2013 sometimes result in exaggerated \u201Cimmunisation responses\u201D. This strong defensive attitude sometimes brings about collateral damage. In other words, fierce biosecurity measures sometimes risk developing into \u201Cautoimmune\u201D responses that actually destruct the body politic they are meant to protect. By drawing on recent insights in the functioning of the biological immune system it is shown how a One-Health approach that incorporates a broader and nuanced \u201Cimmunological\u201D repertoire could act as counter-measure against \u201Cautoimmune\u201D responses in biosecurity.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mutsaers, Inge","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ee2670566c9c39cfd36037b1c127b0fe62edb3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131669.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614006091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446776/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.09.042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953614006091","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Peter Sloterdijk","Spheres Sloterdijk"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential Avian flu pandemic","Swine flu pandemic","immune responses","potential Avian flu threat","virulent Avian flu virus","immunisation responses","biological immune system","immunological concepts","fierce debate","functioning","fierce biosecurity measures","medical-political response","Peter Sloterdijk\u0027s immunological framework","challenging debate","recent insights","scientific level","socio-political level","potential massive loss of human lives","recent viral threats","repertoire","diagnostic tool","fight","risks","protection","infectious diseases","trilogy Spheres Sloterdijk","analysis","words","counter-measure","lab","strong defensive attitude","collateral damage","nature","biggest terrorist","large-scale vaccination","scientists","Health approach","unnecessary scaremongering","contemporary biopolitical situation","pre-emptive strategy","virologists","article","order","body politic","ideas"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10km.

Methods: Data from all ALRI hospitalisations and laboratory records related to respiratory pathogens between 2000 and 2005 were extracted and linked through a population\u2010based record linkage system. The proportion of specimens that were positive for each respiratory viral or bacterial pathogen was documented. Results: Eight thousand nine hundred and eighty (45.2%) ALRI hospitalisations were linked to a laboratory record. Admissions to a private hospital and admissions from non\u2010metropolitan areas were less likely to have a linked laboratory record. In 57.9% of linked hospitalisations, a respiratory virus and/or a bacterial pathogen was identified. Frequently identified viral pathogens included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; n= 3226; 39.5% of those tested), influenza viruses (n= 664; 8.5%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (n= 348; 4.6%), picornaviruses (n= 292; 22.3%) and adenoviruses (n= 211; 2.7%). RSV was identified in 63.7% of bronchiolitis admissions in those aged under 6 months and 33.1% of pneumonia admissions in those aged under 12 months. Influenza viruses were identified in 81.6% of influenza\u2010coded admissions. When a test was requested, Bordetella pertussis was identified in 21.2% of ALRI hospitalisations (n= 354), including 86.8% of whooping cough\u2010coded admissions. Conclusions: This is the first report of population\u2010based data linkage between statewide laboratory data and hospitalisation records and demonstrates proof of principle. RSV continues to be an important pathogen in ALRI. As pathogens were identified across all diagnoses, relying on hospital diagnosis coding alone may not accurately estimate the burden of different categories of ALRI.","publish_time":"2011-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, Hannah C; de Klerk, Nicholas; Keil, Anthony D; Smith, David W; Blyth, Christopher C; Richmond, Peter; Lehmann, Deborah","journal":"J Paediatr Child Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/807265c3c3c932b52cd38cb72d3a4f8346bae0b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166791.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02229.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22077532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":["ALRI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALRI hospitalisations","based laboratory data","linked hospitalisations","respiratory virus","respiratory pathogens","linked laboratory record","coded admissions","statewide laboratory data","laboratory records","pneumonia admissions","bronchiolitis admissions","based data linkage","hospital morbidity data","respiratory syncytial virus","RSV","viral pathogens","bacterial pathogen","influenza viruses","based record linkage system","burden of different categories of ALRI","report of population","private hospital","important pathogen","months","aetiology of acute lower respiratory infection","hospital diagnosis coding","parainfluenza virus type","hospitalisation records","Western Australian children","non\u2010metropolitan areas","diagnoses","proof of principle","whooping cough","Methods","proportion of specimens","test","Bordetella pertussis","Conclusions","picornaviruses","adenoviruses","Results"],"language":"en"},

We compared several purification methods based on affinity chromatography for purification of proteins from cell culture supernatants: metal chelate affinity, strep-tag and immunopurification with a monoclonal antibody. Soluble receptor glycoproteins were engineered with the corresponding peptide tag at their C-terminal end. The proteins were expressed in 293T cells and secreted to the cell supernatant, as monitored by sandwich ELISA. Supernatants were run through the different chromatography columns and several purification-related parameters determined. While all column-retained proteins were easily eluted, the chelating and immunopurification chromatography gave the highest yield and the latest method provided a sample with the highest purity. So, in spite of its cost, immunopurification chromatography gave optimal results for purification of a low abundance protein from a cell supernatant.

Further, the camel single-domain antibody (nanobody) represents a promising antiviral approach with the advantages of small size, stable structure, high specificity and solubility, and the recognition of specific epitopes. However, no NS5B-specific nanobodies against BVDV have been reported. In this study, NS5B-specific nanobodies were isolated from a phage display library of variable domains of Camellidae heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs). Further, an MDBK cell line stably expressing Nb1 was established to explore antiviral activity.

Fecal samples were collected rectally from 689 calves: normal (n = 360) and diarrheic (n = 329). BNoV (84/689, 12.2%) was the most prevalent regardless of diarrhea, followed by BCoV (37/689, 5.4%), BToV (15/689, 2.2%), and BoRVA (13/689, 1.9%). Although BCoV (P = 0.032) and BoRVA (P = 0.007) were significantly associated with diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, BNoV and BToV showed no association. Infection by the four pathogens had no relationship with calf age; BoRVA was detected only in calves aged \u003C 30 days, but this finding was not statistically significant. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BCoV isolates obtained in this study were distinct from the other known BCoVs, and all BNoV isolates belonged to GIII.2 genotype; genetic variations in BNoVs are present in the ROK. BoRVA isolates distributed in the ROK were assigned to G6P[5]. Within the P[5] genotype, our isolates were divided into two lineages: P[5]-III and P[5]-VIII.

A few broad neutralization epitopes identified so far are present on the surface of native HIV-1 envelope spikes whose recognition by antibodies does not depend on conformational changes of the envelope spikes. However, HIV-1 envelope spikes also contain transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes, which are more difficult to identify. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed single chain Fvs (scFvs) derived from seven human monoclonal antibodies and genetically linked them with or without a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment signal. We show that with a GPI attachment signal the scFvs are targeted to lipid rafts of plasma membranes. In addition, we demonstrate that four of the GPI-anchored scFvs, but not their secreted counterparts, neutralize HIV-1 with various degrees of breadth and potency. Among them, GPI-anchored scFv (X5) exhibits extremely potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple clades of HIV-1 strains tested. Moreover, we show that GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) also exhibited more potent neutralization activity than its secretory counterpart. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of GPI-anchored scFv (X5) in the lipid raft of plasma membrane of human CD4(\u002B )T cells confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion, and the infection of HIV-1 captured and transferred by human DCs. CONCLUSIONS: Thus GPI-anchored scFv could be used as a general and effective way to identify antibodies that react with transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes in envelope proteins of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses. The GPI-anchored scFv (X5), because of its breadth and potency, should have a great potential to be developed into anti-viral agent for HIV-1 prevention and therapy.","publish_time":"2010-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Michael; Arora, Reetakshi; Wang, Huiqiang; Liu, Lihong; Kimata, Jason T; Zhou, Paul","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0049ba8861864506e1e8559e7815f4de8b03dbed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2959034.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-7-79; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of HIV","envelope proteins of HIV","GPI-anchored scFvs","envelope spikes","GPI attachment","expression of GPI","multiple clades of HIV","surface of native HIV","exposed neutralization epitopes","broad neutralization activity","Identification of broad neutralization epitopes","potent neutralization activity","X5","envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion","human monoclonal antibodies","potency","human DCs","attachment signal","lipid raft of plasma membrane of human CD4","lipid rafts of plasma membranes","various degrees of breadth","T cells","long-term resistance","anti-viral agent","4E10","study","single chain Fvs","prevention","secretory counterpart","conformational changes","BACKGROUND","great potential","glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol","secreted counterparts","effective way","vaccine development","strains","recognition","CONCLUSIONS","enveloped viruses","therapy","RESULTS","addition"],"language":"en"},

An unprocessed biologic/clinical sample is subjected to nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, a high-order nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction and amplicon melt curve analysis. Biochemical reactions are enclosed in a disposable pouch, minimizing the PCR contamination risk. FilmArray has the potential to detect greater than 100 different nucleic acid targets at one time. These features make the system well-suited for molecular detection of infectious agents. Validation of the FilmArray technology was achieved through development of a panel of assays capable of identifying 21 common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Initial testing of the system using both cultured organisms and clinical nasal aspirates obtained from children demonstrated an analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity comparable to existing diagnostic platforms.

This organ is partly protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from toxic substances and pathogens carried in the bloodstream. Yet, neurotropic viruses can reach the CNS either by crossing the BBB after viremia, or by exploiting motile infected cells as Trojan horses, or by using axonal transport. Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that are critical to control early steps of viral infections. Deficiencies in the IFN pathway have been associated with fatal viral encephalitis both in humans and mice. Therefore, the IFN system provides an essential protection of the CNS against viral infections. Yet, basal activity of the IFN system appears to be low within the CNS, likely owing to the toxicity of IFN to this organ. Moreover, after viral infection, neurons and oligodendrocytes were reported to be relatively poor IFN producers and appear to keep some susceptibility to neurotropic viruses, even in the presence of IFN. This review addresses some trends and recent developments concerning the role of type I and type III IFNs in: i) preventing neuroinvasion and infection of CNS cells; ii) the identity of IFN-producing cells in the CNS; iii) the antiviral activity of ISGs; and iv) the activity of viral proteins of neurotropic viruses that target the IFN pathway.","publish_time":"2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sorgeloos, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Kreit, Marguerite; Hermant, Pascale; Lardinois, C\u00E9cile; Michiels, Thomas","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98c2af7070735431908c6d271df6b49f01924f96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3705299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503326/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v5030834","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["CNS","BBB","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN system","IFN pathway","identity of IFN","presence of IFN","toxicity of IFN","infection of CNS cells","poor IFN producers","activity of viral proteins of neurotropic viruses","differentiated cells","role of type","fatal viral encephalitis","early steps of viral infections","motile infected cells","BBB","IFNs","basal activity","neurons","central nervous system","antiviral activity of ISGs","essential protection","harbors","Trojan horses","toxic substances","recent developments","blood-brain barrier","trends","pathogens","cytokines","humans","oligodendrocytes","neuroinvasion","review","viremia","mice","interferons","susceptibility","functions of complex organisms","axonal transport","bloodstream","Deficiencies"],"language":"en"},

We studied the occurrence and hospitalization rates of HCoV over 9 years. METHODS: Children from S\u00F8r-Tr\u00F8ndelag County, Norway, hospitalized with RTIs and asymptomatic controls, were prospectively enrolled from 2006 to 2015. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed with semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for HCoV subtypes OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and 13 other respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: HCoV was present in 9.1% (313/3458) of all RTI episodes: 46.6% OC43, 32.3% NL63, 16.0% HKU1, and 5.8% 229E. Hospitalization rates for HCoV-positive children with lower RTIs were 1.5 and 2.8 per 1000 \u003C5 and \u003C1 years of age, respectively. The detection rate among controls was 10.2% (38/373).

During maturation, viral polyproteins are typically cleaved into the constituent proteins with different biological functions by highly specific proteases, and structural analyses at defined stages of this maturation process can provide clues for antiviral intervention strategies. Recombinant polyproteins that use similar mechanisms are emerging as powerful tools for producing hitherto inaccessible protein targets such as the influenza polymerase, for high-resolution structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Conversely, covalent linking of individual protein subunits into single polypeptide chains are exploited to overcome sample preparation bottlenecks. Moreover, synthetic polyproteins provide a promising tool to dissect dynamic folding of polypeptide chains into three-dimensional architectures in single-molecule structure analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The recent use of natural and synthetic polyproteins in structural biology and major achievements are highlighted in this contribution.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cr\u00E9pin, Thibaut; Swale, Christopher; Monod, Alexandre; Garzoni, Frederic; Chaillet, Maxime; Berger, Imre","journal":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c747be5467e8f28cfacfe7ecea2072f297f0e3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125721.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2015.04.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X15000597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25996897/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959440X15000597","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthetic polyproteins","Recombinant polyproteins","viral polyproteins","single polypeptide chains","dynamic folding of polypeptide chains","single-molecule structure analysis","structural analyses","structural biology","maturation process","constituent proteins","high-resolution structure determination","inaccessible protein targets","conjoined smaller proteins","recent use of natural","covalent linking of individual protein subunits","three-dimensional architectures","specific proteases","influenza polymerase","atomic force microscopy","different biological functions","powerful tools","defined stages","major achievements","promising tool","clues","nature","similar mechanisms","AFM","antiviral intervention strategies","versatile means","X-ray crystallography","proteome of viruses","sample preparation bottlenecks"],"language":"en"},

Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO \u002B/\u2212 consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). RESULTS: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p \u003C 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854. These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score \u003E 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score \u003E 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score \u003E 2.

In the field of virology, when analyzing the host cell\u0027s reaction to infection, the often high representation of viral RNA (vRNA) within total RNA preparations from infected cells is likely to interfere with microarray analysis. Yet, this effect has not been investigated despite the many reports that describe gene expression profiling of virus-infected cells using microarrays. RESULTS: In this study we used coronaviruses as a model to show that vRNA indeed interferes with microarray analysis, decreasing both sensitivity and accuracy. We also demonstrate that the removal of vRNA from total RNA samples, by means of virus-specific oligonucleotide capturing, significantly reduced the number of false-positive hits and increased the sensitivity of the method as tested on different array platforms.

In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which has been endorsed by each of the 46 WHO African members since then. Yet, taming the dynamics and plague of the vicious Ebola virus disease (EVD) in African countries has been patchy and erratic due to inadequate surveillance and contact tracing, community defiance and resistance, a lack of detection and response systems, meager/weak knowledge and information on the disease, inadequacies in protective materials protocols, contact tracing nightmare and differing priorities at various levels of the public health system. Despite the widespread acceptance of syndromic surveillance (SS) systems, their ability to provide early warning alerts and notifications of outbreaks is still unverified. Information is often too limited for any outbreak, or emerging or otherwise unexpected disease, to be recognized at either the community or the national level. Indeed, little is known about the role and the interactions between the Ebola infection and exposure to other syndemics and the development of acquired immunity, asymptomatic reservoir, and Ebola seroconversion. Can lessons be learnt from smallpox, polio, and influenza immunity, and can immunization against these serve as a guide? In most endemic countries, community health centers and disease control and prevention at airports solely relies on passive routine immunization control and reactive syndromic response. The frontline and airport Ebola SS systems in West Africa have shown deficiencies in terms of responding with an alarming number of case fatalities, and suggest that more detailed insights into Ebola, and proactive actions, are needed. The quest for effective early indicators (EEE) in shifting the public and global health paradigm requires the development and implementation of a comprehensive and effective community or regional integrated pandemic preparedness and surveillance response systems tailored to local contexts. These systems must have mechanisms for early identification, rapid contact tracing and tracking, confirmation, and communication with the local population and the global community, and must endeavor to respond in a timely manner.

Protein modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) is known to inhibit the replication of many viruses. However, studies on the viral targets and viral strategies to regulate ISGylation-mediated antiviral responses are limited. In this study, we show that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication is inhibited by ISGylation, but the virus has evolved multiple countermeasures. HCMV-induced ISG15 expression was mitigated by IE1, a viral inhibitor of interferon signaling, however, ISGylation was still strongly upregulated during virus infection. RNA interference of UBE1L (E1), UbcH8 (E2), Herc5 (E3), and UBP43 (ISG15 protease) revealed that ISGylation inhibits HCMV growth by downregulating viral gene expression and virion release in a manner that is more prominent at low multiplicity of infection. A viral regulator pUL26 was found to interact with ISG15, UBE1L, and Herc5, and be ISGylated. ISGylation of pUL26 regulated its stability and inhibited its activities to suppress NF-\u03BAB signaling and complement the growth of UL26-null mutant virus. Moreover, pUL26 reciprocally suppressed virus-induced ISGylation independent of its own ISGylation. Consistently, ISGylation was more pronounced in infections with the UL26-deleted mutant virus, whose growth was more sensitive to IFN\u03B2 treatment than that of the wild-type virus. Therefore, pUL26 is a viral ISG15 target that also counteracts ISGylation. Our results demonstrate that ISGylation inhibits HCMV growth at multiple steps and that HCMV has evolved countermeasures to suppress ISG15 transcription and protein ISGylation, highlighting the importance of the interplay between virus and ISGylation in productive viral infection.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ye Ji; Kim, Eui Tae; Kim, Young-Eui; Lee, Myoung Kyu; Kwon, Ki Mun; Kim, Keun Il; Stamminger, Thomas; Ahn, Jin-Hyun","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/630a94063d188ceeb2302472ac2e1a0da2e31216.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5001722.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564865/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISGylation of pUL26","protein ISGylation","viral ISG15 target","virus infection","suppressed virus-induced ISGylation independent","HCMV growth","HCMV-induced ISG15 expression","viral strategies","viral targets","ISG15 protease","ISG15 transcription","viral regulator pUL26","viral gene expression","productive viral infection","viral inhibitor of interferon","null mutant virus","growth of UL26","wild-type virus","Protein modification","Herc5","multiple countermeasures","replication","Interferon-stimulated gene","low multiplicity of infection","multiple steps","RNA interference of UBE1L","IE1","manner","virion release","E2","UbcH8","IFN\u03B2 treatment","human cytomegalovirus","E3","UBP43","infections","interplay","importance","activities","stability","studies","results","NF-\u03BAB","antiviral responses","study","ubiquitin","viruses","ISGylated"],"language":"en"},

The cough reflex can be triggered by nociceptive neurons innervating the lungs, and some bacteria produce neuron-targeting molecules. However, how pulmonary Mtb infection causes cough remains undefined, and whether Mtb produces a neuron-activating, cough-inducing molecule is unknown. Here, we show that an Mtb organic extract activates nociceptive neurons in vitro and identify the Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) as the nociceptive molecule. Mtb organic extracts from mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis cannot activate neurons in vitro or induce cough in a guinea pig model. Finally, Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough in a manner dependent on SL-1 synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism for cough induction by a virulent human pathogen via its production of a complex lipid.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruhl, Cody R.; Pasko, Breanna L.; Khan, Haaris S.; Kindt, Lexy M.; Stamm, Chelsea E.; Franco, Luis H.; Hsia, Connie C.; Zhou, Min; Davis, Colton R.; Qin, Tian; Gautron, Laurent; Burton, Michael D.; Mejia, Galo L.; Naik, Dhananjay K.; Dussor, Gregory; Price, Theodore J.; Shiloh, Michael U.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3528add37d78281040babe78cffa1b58a9c5b62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102531.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420301707; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420301707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cough induction","persistent cough","cough reflex","Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough","Mtb organic extracts","pulmonary Mtb infection","SL","Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid","nociceptive neurons","nociceptive molecule","synthesis","Summary Pulmonary tuberculosis","unknown molecular mechanism","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","mechanism of transmission","guinea pig model","manner dependent","disease","virulent human pathogen","production","primary symptom","manifests","mutants","lungs","bacteria","complex lipid","molecules"],"language":"en"},

Rats were immunized either subcutaneously or intranasally with Ad-SN once a week for three consecutive weeks. Our results showed that all of the immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV spike protein, and the sera of immunized rats showed strong capable of protecting from SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Histopathological examination did not find evident side effects in the immunized animals.

To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. METHODS: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. RESULTS: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric data varied widely, from 5 to 20 years of age. Emergency centre capacity was reported using a variety of metrics including annual patient volume (n = 175, 90%); bed count (n = 60, 31%), number of rooms (n = 48, 25%); frequently none of these metrics were reported (n = 16, 8%). Many characteristics essential to describe capabilities and performance of emergency care were not reported, including use and type of triage; level of provider training; admission rate; time to evaluation; and length of EC stay. CONCLUSION: We found considerable heterogeneity in reporting practices for studies of emergency care in LMICs. Standardised metrics could facilitate future analysis and interpretation of such studies, and expand the ability to generalise and compare findings across emergency care settings.","publish_time":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abujaber, Samer; Chang, Cindy Y.; Reynolds, Teri A.; Mowafi, Hani; Obermeyer, Ziad","journal":"Afr J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15068678ec0fe7fd4ee563d914de8dad612bc98a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ec2fc4695722180950530be15c2de896ff404564.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6234170.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2016.06.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211419X16300957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30456077/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211419X16300957","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["studies of emergency care","emergency care delivery","emergency care settings","general emergency care","performance of emergency care","used metrics","facility-level metrics","variety of metrics","LMICs","Standardised metrics","subsets of emergency conditions","Emergency centre capacity","set of standard metrics","set of key metrics","future research","patient-level statistics","little research","Patient demographics","annual patient volume","future analysis","average age","years of age","level of provider training","upper age boundary","subsets of populations","paediatric data","little uniformity","published reports","time","admission rate","reporting practices","Systematic literature review","evaluation","considerable heterogeneity","capabilities","type of triage","middle-income countries","findings","interpretation","characteristics essential","METHODS","researchers","length of EC","multiple facilities","gender breakdown","bed count","number of rooms","CONCLUSION","ability","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Its limitation or suspension, recursively extended over time, could be associated with a significant increase in the number of blind people worldwide. Indeed, cataract causes more than half of all cases of visual impairment in those countries with limited availability of means for performing eye operations (e.g., Africa or India). In this scenario, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly resulted in the suspension or sharp reduction of various ophthalmic activities considered non-urgent, including lens replacement surgery or some intraocular injections. Despite the imperative need to continuously practice eye operations to avoid the abovementioned problems, there are currently little-shared and vague recommendations among the various countries on safety in operating rooms (for health care workers and patients) and poor legal protection for surgeons (potentially transmitting the COVID-19 infectious agent). Herein, we individuated and discussed some critical points in safety recommendations and medical liability. A paradigm shift for ocular surgery during the COVID-19 era is now mandatory. While telemedicine has been able to solve some problems in clinical ophthalmology, the lack of adequate health and legal protection for surgeons and patients may result in an excessive reduction in the volume of surgical interventions during a pandemic era and the immediately following period, thus determining inability to ensure health care to all patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Napoli, Pietro Emanuele; Nioi, Matteo; d\u0027Aloja, Ernesto; Fossarello, Maurizio","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397530/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051403","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","India"],"keyphrases":["patients","COVID","Ocular surgery","various countries","safety recommendations","health care workers","eye operations","surgeons","pandemic era","suspension","lack of adequate health","poor legal protection","lens replacement surgery","excessive reduction","vague recommendations","abovementioned problems","medical liability","sharp reduction of various ophthalmic activities","pandemic of coronavirus disease","performed medical procedures","operating rooms","volume of surgical interventions","cases of visual impairment","clinical ophthalmology","limited availability","critical points","half","intraocular injections","number of blind people","significant increase","paradigm shift","world","scenario","Africa","period","imperative need","inability","India","infectious agent","telemedicine","cataract","limitation","time"],"language":"en"},

This raises the question of how evolution has chosen the nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 that is observed today, or to what extent the actual encoding contributes to virus replication capacity, evolvability and pathogenesis. Here, we applied the previously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach to HIV-1. RESULTS: Using synonymous codon pairs, we rationally recoded and codon pair\u2013optimized and deoptimized different moieties of the HIV-1 gag and pol genes. Deoptimized viruses had significantly lower viral replication capacity in MT-4 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Varying degrees of ex vivo attenuation were obtained, depending upon both the specific deoptimized region and the number of deoptimized codons. A protease optimized virus carrying 38 synonymous mutations was not attenuated and displayed a replication capacity similar to that of the wild-type virus in MT-4 cells and PBMCs. Although attenuation is based on several tens of nucleotide changes, deoptimized HIV-1 reverted to wild-type virulence after serial passages in MT-4 cells. Remarkably, no reversion was observed in the optimized virus.

Several putative functional domains such as a papain-like proteinase (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important for virus replication. We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal sequence, PLpro, Mpro, and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. All the coronavirus 5\u2032-termini and PLpro domains were divergent, unlike the Mpro and the RdRp domains that were highly conserved with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among IBV strains, the 5\u2032 untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (\u003E94% identical); whereas, the N-terminal coding region and the PLpro domains were highly variable ranging from 84.6% to 100%, and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV Mpro and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. Phylogeny-based clustering based on replicase genes was identical to the antigen-based classification of coronaviruses into three groups. However, the IBV strain classification based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of the type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses irrespective of serotype, suggesting that either there has been an exchange of genetic material among vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution to a specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that the replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2004-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mondal, Shankar P; Cardona, Carol J","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e78f1c1d9cd697f8b9141342fa2bb93209942e83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125564.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682204002193; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682204002193","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","IBV Mpro","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replicase gene domains","PLpro domains","RdRp domains","replicase genes","IBV Mpro","replicase gene sequences","specific replicase genotype","conserved residues","IBV strain classification","putative functional domains","heterologous IBV strains","terminal sequence","leader sequence","sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA helicase","untranslated region","IBVs","antigen-based classification of coronaviruses","Phylogeny-based clustering","regions","N-terminal coding region","published coronavirus sequences","virus replication","vaccine viruses","type-specific antigenic groups","BJ strain","Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus","papain","main protease","field isolates","exchange of genetic material","convergent evolution","proteinase","nucleotide","subgenomic","infected chickens","termini","pathotype","genome","mRNAs","sg","variable ranging","discontinuous process","serotype","correlation","identity"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a rapid systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 papers identified, ten were included in this narrative synthesis.

To assess the molecular mechanisms behind the induced apoptosis we studied the effects of hantavirus infection on cellular signaling pathways which promote cell survival. We previously also observed that the Tula virus-induced cell death process is augmented by external TNF-\u03B1. Since TNF-\u03B1 is involved in the pathogenesis of hantavirus-caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) we investigated its effects on HFRS-causing hantavirus-infected cells. RESULTS: We studied both apathogenic (Tula and Topografov) and pathogenic (Puumala and Seoul) hantaviruses for their ability to regulate cellular signaling pathways and observed a direct virus-mediated down-regulation of external signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) survival pathway activity, which was dramatically enhanced by TNF-\u03B1. The fold of ERK1/2 inhibition correlated with viral replication efficiencies, which varied drastically between the hantaviruses studied. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that in the presence of a cytokine TNF-\u03B1, which is increased in HFRS patients, hantaviruses are capable of inactivating proteins that promote cell survival (ERK1/2). These results imply that hantavirus-infected epithelial cell barrier functions might be compromised in diseased individuals and could at least partially explain the mechanisms of renal dysfunction and the resulting proteinuria seen in HFRS patients.","publish_time":"2008-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strandin, Tomas; Hepojoki, Jussi; Wang, Hao; Vaheri, Antti; Lankinen, Hilkka","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e716720f4daa4c2f5f85df4b4ee6838255d4f80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2569924.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-5-110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18822184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Vero","Seoul"],"keyphrases":["cell survival","apathogenic Tula hantavirus","external TNF-\u03B1","pathogenesis of hantavirus","hantavirus-infected cells","HFRS patients","hantaviruses","cytokine TNF-\u03B1","effects of hantavirus infection","hantavirus-infected epithelial cell barrier functions","Tula virus-induced cell death process","induced apoptosis","pathways","fold of ERK1","RESULTS","mechanisms of renal dysfunction","survival pathway activity","Vero E6 epithelial cells","renal syndrome","direct virus","molecular mechanisms","regulation of external signal-regulated kinases","hemorrhagic fever","capable of inactivating proteins","resulting proteinuria","inhibition","Puumala","Seoul","Topografov","ability","viral replication efficiencies","presence","diseased individuals","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

As bats have ancient evolutionary origins and are the only flying mammals, it has been hypothesized that some of their unique biological features may have made them especially suitable hosts for different viruses.

While characteristics of severe pertussis infection have been described in infants, fewer data are available in older children and adults. In this analysis, we characterize pertussis infections in hospitalized patients of all ages. METHODS: Cases of pertussis with cough onset from 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2015 from 7 US Emerging Infections Program Network states were reviewed. Additional information on hospitalized patients was obtained through abstraction of the inpatient medical record. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were conducted to characterize severe pertussis infection and identify potential risk factors. RESULTS: Among 15942 cases of pertussis reported, 515 (3.2%) were hospitalized. Three hospitalized patients died. Infants aged \u003C2 months accounted for 1.6% of all pertussis cases but 29.3% of hospitalizations. Infants aged 2\u201311 months and adults aged \u226565 years also had high rates of hospitalization. Infants aged \u003C2 months whose mothers received acellular pertussis during the third trimester and children aged 2 months to 11 years who were up to date on pertussis-containing vaccines had a 43%\u201366% reduced risk of hospitalization. Among adolescents aged 12\u201320 years, 43.5% had a history of asthma, and among adults aged \u226565 years, 26.8% had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals at the extreme ends of life may be the most vulnerable to severe pertussis infections, though hospitalization was reported across all age groups. Continued monitoring of severe pertussis infections will be important to help guide prevention, control, and treatment options.","publish_time":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mbayei, Sarah A; Faulkner, Amanda; Miner, Christine; Edge, Karen; Cruz, Victor; Pe\u00F1a, Sandra A; Kudish, Kathy; Coleman, Joan; Pradhan, Eva; Thomas, Stepy; Martin, Stacey; Skoff, Tami H","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64d0b55d031c7b44e3bb805db562f963f2bb47b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321305/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy889","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Emerging Infections Program Network"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Cases of pertussis","pertussis cases","severe pertussis infections","incidence of pertussis","acellular pertussis","characteristics of severe pertussis infection","months","infants","hospitalized patients","recent years","adults","reduced risk of hospitalization","US Emerging Infections Program Network states","high rates of hospitalization","United States","older children","history of asthma","potential risk factors","history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","fewer data","abstraction","Individuals","extreme ends of life","prevention","control","trimester","mothers","multivariable analyses","cough onset","treatment options","inpatient medical record","CONCLUSIONS","Additional information","METHODS","date","ages","age groups","vaccines","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","hospitalizations","analysis","adolescents"],"language":"en"},

Primers and a probe specific for this region were designed for a real-time RT-PCR assay to detect FCV. Initial validation was done using 15 genetically diverse isolates. Also, 122 samples were tested by the new assay and virus isolation. The real-time RT-PCR assay was as sensitive and specific as virus isolation and was far more rapid.

In order to assess the possibility of clinical application of a newly developed non-contact infection screening system, we conducted screening for influenza patients. Materials and methods The system is operated by a screening program via a linear discriminant analysis using non-contact derived variables, i.e., palmar pulse derived from a laser Doppler blood-flow meter, respiration rate determined by a 10-GHz microwave radar, and average facial temperature measured by thermography. The system was tested on 57 seasonal influenza (2008\u20132009) patients (35.7 \u00B0C \u2264 body temperature \u2264 38.3 \u00B0C, 19\u201340 years) and 35 normal control subjects (35.5 \u00B0C \u2264 body temperature \u2264 36.9 \u00B0C, 21\u201335 years) at the Japan Self-defense Forces Central Hospital.

(Saururaceae) and three of its constituent flavonoids (quercetin, quercitrin and rutin) against murine coronavirus and dengue virus (DENV). Methods The antiviral activities of various concentrations of the EA fraction of H. cordata and flavonoids were assessed using virus neutralization tests against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and DENV type 2 (DENV-2). Cinanserin hydrochloride was also tested against MHV. The EA fraction of H. cordata was tested for acute oral toxicity in C57BL/6 mice. Results The EA fraction of H. cordata inhibited viral infectivity up to 6 d. Cinanserin hydrochloride was able to inhibit MHV for only 2 d. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the EA fraction of H. cordata added before the viral adsorption stage were 0.98 \u03BCg/mL for MHV and 7.50 \u03BCg/mL for DENV-2 with absence of cytotoxicity. The mice fed with the EA fraction up to 2000 mg/kg did not induce any signs of acute toxicity, with normal histological features of major organs. Certain flavonoids exhibited comparatively weaker antiviral activity, notably quercetin which could inhibit both MHV and DENV-2. This was followed by quercitrin which could inhibit DENV-2 but not MHV, whereas rutin did not exert any inhibitory effect on either virus. When quercetin was combined with quercitrin, enhancement of anti-DENV-2 activity and reduced cytotoxicity were observed. However, the synergistic efficacy of the flavonoid combination was still less than that of the EA fraction. Conclusions The compounds in H. cordata contribute to the superior antiviral efficacy of the EA fraction which lacked cytotoxicity in vitro and acute toxicity in vivo. H. cordata has much potential for the development of antiviral agents against coronavirus and dengue infections.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiow, K. H.; Phoon, M.

In this perspective article, the lessons learnt from the outbreak are used to review the challenges impeding effective implementation of the IHR and to propose policy and strategic options for enhancing its application. While some progress has been achieved in implementing the IHR in several countries, numerous challenges continue to impede its effectiveness, especially in developing countries, such as those affected by the West Africa EVD outbreak. Political and economic sensitivities associated with reporting public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), inadequate resources (human and financial), and lack of technical know-how required for implementation of the IHR are weaknesses that continue to constrain the implementation of the regulations. In view of the complex sociopolitical, cultural, and public health dimensions of PHEICs, frameworks, such as the IHR, which have legal backing, seem to be the most effective and sustainable option for assuring timely detection, notification, and response to such events. Renewed efforts to strengthen national and global institutional frameworks for implementation of the IHR are therefore required. Improvements in transparency, commitment, and accountability of parties to the IHR, mainstreaming of the IHR into national public health governance structures, use of multidisciplinary approaches, and mobilization of the required resources for the implementation of the IHR are imperative.","publish_time":"2016-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olu, Olushayo Oluseun","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e788ce631ca8a7d0a0d0b48dfd06d343de282972.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4899437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27376056/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHR"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["IHR","effective implementation","International Health Regulations","required resources","public health dimensions of PHEICs","national public health governance structures","West Africa EVD outbreak","reporting public health emergencies of international concern","inadequate resources","numerous challenges","inherent weaknesses","developing countries","global institutional frameworks","timely detection","economic sensitivities","notification","human","multidisciplinary approaches","sustainable option","Ebola virus disease","lack of technical know-how","commitment","response","effectiveness","mobilization","Renewed efforts","strategic options","accountability of parties","transparency","view","lessons","policy","perspective article","Improvements","application","events","legal backing","progress"],"language":"en"},

A few veterinary vaccines employing this concept have already been licensed, and a multitude of clinical trials against infectious diseases or different forms of cancer are ongoing. Highly important when developing novel vaccines are the safety aspects and also new adjuvants and delivery techniques needs to be carefully investigated so that they meet all short- and long-term safety requirements. One novel in vivo delivery method for plasmid vaccines is electroporation, which is the application of short pulses of electric current immediately after, and at the site of, an injection of a genetic vaccine. This method has been shown to significantly augment the transfection efficacy and the subsequent vaccine-specific immune responses. However, the dramatic increase in delivery efficacy offered by electroporation has raised concerns of potential increase in the risk of integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome. Here, we demonstrate the safety and lack of integration after immunization with a high dose of a multigene HIV-1 vaccine delivered intradermally using the needle free device Biojector 2000 together with electroporation using Derma Vax\u2122 DNA Vaccine Skin Delivery System. We demonstrate that plasmids persist in the skin at the site of injection for at least four months after immunization. However, no association between plasmid DNA and genomic DNA could be detected as analyzed by qPCR following field inversion gel electrophoresis separating heavy and light DNA fractions. We will shortly initiate a phase I clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be immunized with this multiplasmid HIV-1 vaccine using a combination of the delivery methods jet-injection and intradermal electroporation.","publish_time":"2010-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Br\u00E5ve, Andreas; Gudmundsdotter, Lindvi; Sandstr\u00F6m, Eric; Haller, B.

Aberrant transduction of Notch signaling contributes to many diseases and cancers in humans. The Notch receptor intracellular domain, the activated form of Notch receptor, is extremely difficult to detect in normal cells. However, it can activate signaling at very low protein concentration to elicit its biological effects. In the present study, a cell based luciferase reporter gene assay was established in K562 cells to screen drugs which could modulate the endogenous CBF1\u2010dependent Notch signal pathway. Using this system, we found that the luciferase activity of CBF1\u2010dependent reporter gene was activated by baicalin and baicalein but suppressed by niclosamide in both dose\u2010 and time\u2010dependent manners. Treatment with these drugs modulated endogenous Notch signaling and affected mRNA expression levels of Notch1 receptor and Notch target genes in K562 cells. Additionally, erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was suppressed by baicalin and baicalein yet was promoted by niclosamide. Colony\u2010forming ability in soft agar was decreased after treatment with baicalin and baicalein, but was not affected in the presence of niclosamide. Thus, modulation of Notch signaling after treatment with any of these three drugs may affect tumorigenesis of K562 cells suggesting that these drugs may have therapeutic potential for those tumors associated with Notch signaling. Taken together, this system could be beneficial for screening of drugs with potential to treat Notch signal pathway\u2010associated diseases. J. Cell.

However, the development of novel but still conventional systemic antimicrobial agents, having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably only a matter of time until any such agents will also become ineffective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore offer both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specificity at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored. In this Personal View, we raise awareness of the novel photoantimicrobial technologies that offer a viable alternative to conventional drugs in many relevant application fields, and could thus slow the pace of resistance development.","publish_time":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wainwright, Mark; Maisch, Tim; Nonell, Santi; Plaetzer, Kristjan; Almeida, Adelaide; Tegos, George P; Hamblin, Michael R","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49a99c3b98eb0787b6589580512a30d50c005d27.json; document_parses/pdf_json/108c9e0af858a7aa201aa9faf3d09db666e68752.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5280084.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309916302687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309916302687; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(16)30268-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27884621/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5280084?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conventional agents","development of resistance","new agents","conventional systemic antimicrobial agents","conventional drugs","toxic agents","conventional antimicrobial drugs","conventional mechanisms of resistance","antimicrobial drug resistance","development of novel","pace of resistance development","photoantimicrobials act","activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials","novel photoantimicrobial technologies","variable sites of action","morass of drug","viable alternative","pathogenic target","alternative approaches","Photoantimicrobial therapy","site of action","increasing need","various biomolecular sites","years","reactive oxygen species","light-activated molecules","fungi","bacteria","awareness","situ production","miraculous cure-alls","single mode","relevant application fields","resistant infectious disease","viruses","rapid intervention","non-specificity","contrast","problem","research","ways","notion","clinical trials","Personal View","protozoa","funding","matter of time","situation"],"language":"en"},

However, no antiviral drugs have shown therapeutic effects against rotavirus infections. The newly discovered human retrovirus (HTLV) has not yet been investigated in such detail as to predict the usefulness of vaccine or antiviral drugs. Several compounds are known to inhibit other retrovirus enzymes but the implication of this for chemotherapy of HTLV infection is unknown at present. The possibility and need for vaccination or chemotherapy against Norwalk virus and related agents is unclear. Very little work has been carried out to date with human coronaviruses, either from the point of view of vaccine development or specific antivirals. Both approaches may be usefully investigated in the future. Genetic cloning may be particularly useful for development of inactivated vaccines because the virus itself would be difficult to replicate and purify in large quantities for conventional vaccines.","publish_time":"1985-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Perspectives in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20d7551ecd14f5f02421184c2e2a68f8cf6d204d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287581/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(08)70017-x; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016870690870017X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016870690870017X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTLV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral drugs","vaccine development","Norwalk virus","rotavirus enzymes useful","rotavirus infections","development of inactivated vaccines","retrovirus enzymes","conventional vaccines","human coronaviruses","usefulness of vaccine","chemotherapy of HTLV infection","discovered human retrovirus","therapeutic effects","therapeutic measures","rotaviruses","rubella","reoviridae","related agents","point of view","targets","High incidence of acute gastroenteritis","chapter","specific antivirals","vaccination","implication","large quantities","Publisher Summary","present","date","Genetic cloning","possibility","little work","compounds","approaches","future","years"],"language":"en"},

The 16 SARS-CoV nsps are produced by autoprocessing of two large precursor polyproteins. The RTC is believed to be associated with characteristic virus-induced double-membrane structures in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected cells. To investigate the link between these structures and viral RNA synthesis, and to dissect RTC organization and function, we isolated active RTCs from infected cells and used them to develop the first robust assay for their in vitro activity. The synthesis of genomic RNA and all eight subgenomic mRNAs was faithfully reproduced by the RTC in this in vitro system. Mainly positive-strand RNAs were synthesized and protein synthesis was not required for RTC activity in vitro. All RTC activity, enzymatic and putative membrane-spanning nsps, and viral RNA cosedimented with heavy membrane structures. Furthermore, the pelleted RTC required the addition of a cytoplasmic host factor for reconstitution of its in vitro activity. Newly synthesized subgenomic RNA appeared to be released, while genomic RNA remained predominantly associated with the RTC-containing fraction. RTC activity was destroyed by detergent treatment, suggesting an important role for membranes. The RTC appeared to be protected by membranes, as newly synthesized viral RNA and several replicase/transcriptase subunits were protease- and nuclease-resistant and became susceptible to degradation only upon addition of a non-ionic detergent. Our data establish a vital functional dependence of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis on virus-induced membrane structures.","publish_time":"2008-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Hemert, Martijn J.; van den Worm, Sjoerd H.

Although there is little doubt that microbes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of NEC, the identity of specific causative pathogens remains elusive. Unlike established normal adult gut microbiota, which is quite complex, uniform, and stable, early postnatal bacterial populations are simple, diverse, and fluid. These properties complicate studies aimed at elucidating characteristics of the gut microbiome that may play a role in the pathogenesis of NEC. A broad variety of bacterial, viral, and fungal species have been implicated in both clinical and experimental NEC. Frequently, however, the same species have also been found in physiologically matched healthy individuals. Clustered outbreaks of NEC, in which the same strain of a suspected pathogen is detected in several patients suggest, but do not prove, a causative relationship between the specific pathogen and the disease. Studies in Cronobacter sakazakii, the best characterized NEC pathogen, have demonstrated that virulence is not a property of a bacterial species as a whole, but rather a characteristic of certain strains, which may explain why the same species can be pathogenic or non-pathogenic. The fact that a given microbe may be innocuous in a full-term, yet pathogenic in a pre-term infant has led to the idea of opportunistic pathogens in NEC. Progress in understanding the infectious nature of NEC may require identifying specific pathogenic strains and unambiguously establishing their virulence in animal models.","publish_time":"2013-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grishin, Anatoly; Papillon, Stephanie; Bell, Brandon; Wang, Jin; Ford, Henri R.","journal":"Seminars in Pediatric Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0906ab25c9872b8b349cdf70f9e2bea71e122d6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f3c27d469ef45df8d3312675bbbffe18bd697c7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3647029.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1055858613000036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23611609/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3647029?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055858613000036; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.sempedsurg.2013.01.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of NEC","experimental NEC","bacterial species","infectious nature of NEC","Clustered outbreaks of NEC","best characterized NEC pathogen","specific pathogenic strains","bacterial colonization","fungal species","premature infant","identity of specific causative pathogens","broad variety of bacterial","suspected pathogen","virulence","studies","early postnatal bacterial populations","pre-term infant","gut microbiome","causative relationship","congenital heart disease","idea of opportunistic pathogens","characteristic of certain strains","normal adult gut microbiota","enteral feedings","Cronobacter sakazakii","elucidating characteristics","susceptible host","uniform","role","given microbe","Development of necrotizing enterocolitis","microbes","properties","property","matched healthy individuals","little doubt","fact","Progress","fluid","animal models","patients"],"language":"en"},

Multidisciplinary guidelines had been drafted to control transmission and limit adverse outcomes for both a phase of early incidental introduction and for a phase with widespread transmission. The Ministry of Health had ensured a supply and distribution schedule for antivirals and negotiated a contract for vaccine purchases. During the pandemic, existing surveillance was expanded, the established infectious disease response structure was activated, and the previously prepared protocols for communication, diagnostics, use of antivirals, and vaccination implementation were operationalized and implemented. When the pandemic turned out to be less severe than many had anticipated, risk communication and rapid modification of guidelines and communication became a major challenge. Antivirals and pandemic vaccines were reserved for those at high risk for severe outcomes only. Overall, the impact of the pandemic was comparable to the impact of an average seasonal influenza epidemic, but with a shift in (severe) outcomes from the very young and elderly toward young adults. Established prepared protocols enabled timely coordinated responses. In preparing for the worst, sufficient attention must be given to preparing for a mild scenario as well.","publish_time":"2012-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Sande, M.A.B.; Jacobi, A.; Meijer, A.; Wallinga, J.; van der Hoek, W.; van der Lubben, M.","journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d04c31d28ba64e731b74d749a4e9b99dcb7ace5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23275958/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-012-1582-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Ministry of Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antivirals","severe outcomes","pandemic vaccines","potential pandemic","risk communication","prepared protocols","impact","adverse outcomes","high risk","young adults","Multidisciplinary guidelines","widespread transmission","rapid modification of guidelines","phase of early incidental introduction","established infectious disease response structure","supply","average seasonal influenza epidemic","contract","distribution schedule","timely coordinated responses","shift","elderly","diagnostics","existing surveillance","major challenge","Ministry of Health","vaccine purchases","worst","sufficient attention","vaccination implementation","mild scenario","Netherlands"],"language":"en"},

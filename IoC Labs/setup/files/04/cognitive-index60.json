However, in other cases, TNF will cause cell death. Considering the abnormal proliferation and activation of rheumatoid arthritis synovioblasts, the proper rate of synovioblast apoptosis could possibly relieve arthritis. However, the mechanism mediating TNF-induced synovioblast survival versus cell death in RA is not fully understood. Our objective was to study the role of CD147 in TNF downstream pathway preference in RA synovioblasts. We found that overexpressing TNF in synovial tissue did not increase the apoptotic level and, in vitro, TNF-induced mild synovioblast apoptosis and promoted IL-6 secretion. CD147, which was highly expressed in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), increased the resistance of synovioblasts to apoptosis under TNF stimulation. Downregulating CD147 both increased the apoptotic rate and inhibited I\u03BAB kinase (IKK)/I\u03BAB/NF-\u03BAB pathway-dependent proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Further, we determined that it was the extracellular portion of CD147 and not the intracellular portion that was responsible for synovioblast apoptosis resistance. CD147 monoclonal antibody inhibited TNF-induced proinflammatory cytokine production but had no effect on apoptotic rates. Thus, our study indicates that CD147 is resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis by promoting IKK/I\u03BAB/NF-\u03BAB pathway, and the extracellular portion of CD147 is the functional region. KEY MESSAGES: CD147 inhibits TNF-stimulated RASF apoptosis. CD147 knockdown decreases IKK expression and inhibits NF-\u03BAB-related cytokine secretion. CD147\u2019s extracellular portion is responsible for apoptosis resistance. CD147 antibody inhibits TNF-related cytokine secretion without additional apoptosis.","publish_time":"2015-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhai, Yue; Wu, Bo; Li, Jia; Yao, Xi-ying; Zhu, Ping; Chen, Zhi-nan","journal":"J Mol Med (Berl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/975d411fad24d1ecbc93c07a814b6fc42929bc0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080145.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26296700/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00109-015-1334-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF","RA","IKK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TNF-induced apoptosis","CD147 antibody","overexpressing TNF","TNF stimulation","extracellular portion of CD147","role of CD147","Downregulating CD147","TNF-related cytokine secretion","apoptosis resistance","TNF-stimulated RASF apoptosis","TNF-induced proinflammatory cytokine production","CD147 monoclonal antibody","additional apoptosis","TNF downstream pathway preference","CD147 knockdown decreases IKK expression","NF-\u03BAB pathway-dependent proinflammatory cytokine secretion","synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis","RA synovioblasts","resistance of synovioblasts","activation of rheumatoid arthritis synovioblasts","rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts","s extracellular portion","intracellular portion","inhibited I\u03BAB kinase","apoptotic level","apoptotic rates","cell death","study","proper rate","effect","survival","RASFs","patients","abnormal proliferation","functional region","KEY MESSAGES","cases","IL","mechanism","objective","ABSTRACT"],"language":"en"},

Neutrophil migration is regulated by chemokine receptors and their cognate ligands. Our previous study investigated the effect of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. The present study stimulated neutrophils with LPS to explore the influence of LPS on cell. Neutrophils were then pretreated with n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis followed by LPS to examine the effect of this extract on neutrophil chemotaxis. The results showed that LPS decreased the expression levels of CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)1, CXCR2 and L-selectin (CD62L), and increased the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by neutrophils. The addition of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis inhibited this LPS-induced downregulation of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD62L, and decreased the expression of IL-8 on neutrophils. In addition, n-butanol extract promoted myeloperoxidase activity in neutrophils. Taken together, LPS downregulated the expression of chemokine receptors, leading to the failure of neutrophils to migrate to sites of infection. The addition of n-butanol extract, which promoted the ability of neutrophils to migrate, is a natural product and potential therapeutic agent with which to target neutrophil chemotaxis during LPS stimulation.","publish_time":"2017-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Beibei; Wang, Liyin; Jiang, Lili; Dong, Lili; Xu, Fengli; Lu, Yili; Jin, Jiahui; Wang, Zhanyue; Liang, Guang; Shan, Xiaoou","journal":"Mol Med Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f0bb7346d45679cc1bb2435c66d5ad3ef52c108.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780124.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2017.7870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29115434/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["n-butanol extract","influence of LPS","LPS stimulation","failure of neutrophils","ability of neutrophils","addition of n","effect of n","Folium isatidis","expression of chemokine receptors","LPS-induced downregulation of CXCR1","expression of IL","neutrophil chemotaxis","expression of interleukin","expression levels of CXC","CXCR2","CD62L","Neutrophil migration","previous study","present study","lipopolysaccharide","invading pathogens","potential therapeutic agent","myeloperoxidase activity","immune cells crucial","natural product","sepsis","cognate ligands","sites of infection","septic shock","selectin","results"],"language":"en"},

The applications of RNAi in medicine are unlimited because all cells possess RNAi machinery and hence all genes can be potential targets for therapy.

Some key human\u2010borne pathogens that have been shown to infect animals and cause morbidity and mortality include measles virus (paramyxoviruses), influenza A virus (orthomyxoviruses), herpes simplex 1 virus (herpesviruses), protozoal and helminthic parasites, and bacteria such as methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, zooanthroponotic pathogens are most commonly reported in captive animals or domestic livestock with close human contact; there, the potential for economic loss and human reinfection is most apparent. There is also the potential for infection in wild animal populations, which may threaten endangered species and decrease biodiversity. The emergence and reemergence of human\u2010borne pathogens in wildlife may also have negative consequences for human health if these pathogens cycle back into humans.

AIM: To investigate the association between laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections and potential sources of exposure during the previous 7 days. METHODS: In this nested case\u2013control analysis, healthcare personnel from nine Canadian hospitals who developed acute respiratory illnesses during the winters of 2010/11\u20132013/14 submitted swabs that were tested for viral pathogens. Associated illness diaries and the weekly diaries of non-ill participants provided information on contact with people displaying symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the previous week. Conditional logistic regression assessed the association between cases, who were matched by study week and site with controls with no respiratory symptoms. FINDINGS: There were 814 laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory illnesses. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a viral illness was higher for healthcare personnel reporting exposures to ill household members [7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4\u20139.1], co-workers (3.4, 95% CI 2.4\u20134.7) or other social contacts (5.1, 95% CI 3.6\u20137.1). Exposures to patients with respiratory illness were not associated with infection (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7\u20131.2); however, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact did have higher odds (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1\u20131.6). The aORs for exposure and for direct patient contact were similar for illnesses caused by influenza. CONCLUSION: Community and co-worker contacts are important sources of viral respiratory illness in healthcare personnel, while exposure to patients with recognized respiratory infections is not associated. The comparatively low risk associated with direct patient contact may reflect transmission related to asymptomatic patients or unrecognized infections.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buckrell, S.; Coleman, B.L.; McNeil, S.A.; Katz, K.; Muller, M.P.; Simor, A.; Loeb, M.; Powis, J.; Kuster, S.P.; Di Bella, J.M.; Coleman, K.K.L.; Drews, S.J.; Kohler, P.; McGeer, A.","journal":"J Hosp Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f51d1ecbc42537a83a9a01f6a6aa4f7284978fb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172118.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120300128; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31954763/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120300128","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Associated","CI","Community"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral respiratory illnesses","viral respiratory infections","viral illness","respiratory symptoms","acute respiratory illnesses","important sources of viral respiratory illness","symptoms of acute respiratory illness","recognized respiratory infections","Associated illness diaries","viral pathogens","direct patient contact","healthcare personnel reporting exposures","asymptomatic patients","potential sources of exposure","higher odds","unrecognized infections","association","laboratory","previous week","co-worker contacts","study week","social contacts","weekly diaries of non-ill participants","ill household members","adjusted odds ratio","information","people","Canadian hospitals","transmission","common causes of outbreaks","nested case","control analysis","Community","site","controls","confidence interval","cases","low risk","winters","BACKGROUND","Conditional logistic regression","CONCLUSION","swabs","aORs","METHODS","influenza","days","AIM","FINDINGS","co-workers"],"language":"en"},

Several risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC, such as chronic persistent infection with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, chronic untreated inflammation of liver with different etiology, oxidative stress and fatty liver disease. Several treatment protocols are used in the treatment of HCC but they also associated with diverse side effects. Many natural products are helpful in the co-treatment and prevention of HCC. Several mechanisms are involved in the action of these herbal products and their bioactive compounds in the prevention and co-treatment of HCC. They can inhibit the liver cancer development and progression in several ways as protecting against liver carcinogens, enhancing effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis, and suppression of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. In this review, we will discuss the utility of diverse natural products in the prevention and co-treatment of HCC, through its capturing of the common risk factors known to lead to HCC and shed the light on their possible mechanisms of action. Our theory assumes that shutting down the risk factor to cancer development pathways is a critical strategy in cancer prevention and management.

As the new disease was very similar to the deadly SARS (2002\u20132003) and since it was provoked by a Betacoronavirus, chiroptera were first suspected to be at the origin of this infection. Morever, recent studies performed in Saudi Arabia showed that one individual of the bat Taphozous perforatus harbored a short nucleotide segment identical to the homologous segment present in the viral strain isolated from the index-case of the epidemic. In addition, many strains of Betacoronavirus more or less related to those responsible for the MERS disease in man have been isolated from bats in Africa, Asia and Europe. However, another hypothesis was simultaneously proposed incriminating dromedary (Camelus dromedarius L.) as a likely actor in the transmission to human beings of the disease.We then reviewed data relative to other viral zoonosis in which dromedary was possibly implicated. This led to the provisional conclusion that this large mammal might play a role in the dissemination of the MERS-COV, the etiologic agent of the disease.

Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately-applicable protocol. METHODS: RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8- ,16-, 32- and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8. RESULTS: A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction. CONCLUSIONS: As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yelin, Idan; Aharony, Noga; Shaer Tamar, Einat; Argoetti, Amir; Messer, Esther; Berenbaum, Dina; Shafran, Einat; Kuzli, Areen; Gandali, Nagham; Shkedi, Omer; Hashimshony, Tamar; Mandel-Gutfreund, Yael; Halberthal, Michael; Geffen, Yuval; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Kishony, Roy","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1dc6c975b290058faee40892e00981f606d2e57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358960/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Detection of positive samples","Single positive samples","RNA extracts of positive samples","transport media of negative samples","sample pools","standard protocols","Transport media of additional","pools of different sizes","expanding current screening capacities","shortages of reagents","current pandemic of unprecedented scale","presence of SARS","current clinical testing laboratories","estimated false negative rate","standard kits","expansion of detection","pool test","pooling method","RNA extraction","recent emergence of SARS","additional amplification cycles","hospital departments","army units","COVID","lead","equipment","ability","close organic groups","METHODS","overwhelmed healthcare systems","factory shifts","diagnostic tests","implementation","community","BACKGROUND","RT-qPCR","RESULTS","applicable protocol","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, development of veterinary vaccines is a challenging task, in part, due to a variety of pathogens, hosts, and the uniqueness of host-susceptibility to each pathogen. Therefore, novel concepts of vaccines should be explored to overcome the limitation of conventional vaccines.

It has been shown to be multiphosphorylated. However, the phosphorylation sites are still unknown. In this study, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) to analyze the phosphorylation sites of N protein expressed in Sf9 cells. The results showed that N protein contains two phosphorylation sites. Since N protein can regulate IL-10, which may facilitate PRRSV replication, we constructed four plasmids (pCA-XH-GD, pCA-A105, pCA-A120 and pCA-A105-120) and transfected them into Pig alveolar macrophages (PAMs,3D4/2). The qPCR results showed that mutations at residues 105 and 120 were associated with down-regulation of the IL-10 mRNA level, potentially decreasing the viral growth ability. Then, we mutated the phosphorylation sites (S105A and S120A) and rescued three mutated viruses, namely, A105, A120 and A105-120. Compared with wild-type virus titers, the titers of the mutated viruses at 48 hpi were significantly decreased. The Nsp(non-structural protein) 9 qPCR results were consistent with the multistep growth kinetics results. The infected PAMs (primary PAMs) results were similar with Marc-145.The findings indicated that the mutations impaired the viral replication ability. The confocal microscopy results suggested that mutations to residues 105 and 120 did not affect N protein distribution. Whether the mutations affected other functions of N protein and what the underlying mechanisms are need further investigation. In conclusion, our results show that residues 105 and 120 are phosphorylation sites and are important for N protein function and for viral replication ability.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yao; Xing, Xiulin; Li, Qi; Feng, Songlin; Han, Xiaoliang; He, Shuyi; Zhang, Guihong","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60c83cfedf98238b33cbcb76551180c494eebd5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117435.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518302098; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.04.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518302098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778185/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marc"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phosphorylation sites of N protein","N protein function","functions of N protein","N protein distribution","non-structural protein","qPCR results","pCA-A105","mutations","abundant protein of porcine reproductive","pCA-A120","confocal microscopy results","viral replication ability","residues","multistep growth kinetics results","viral growth ability","pCA-XH","PRRSV replication","mutated viruses","primary PAMs","infected PAMs","wild-type virus titers","respiratory syndrome virus","LC","liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry","GD","plasmids","S120A","3D4","Pig alveolar macrophages","mRNA level","Marc","underlying mechanisms","Sf9 cells","study","Nsp","S105A","investigation","regulation","findings","hpi","conclusion","nucleocapsid"],"language":"en"},

Expression of FIP1C and Rab14 led to an enhancement of Env incorporation, indicating that these trafficking factors are normally limiting for CT-dependent Env incorporation onto particles.

Here, we report a rationally designed novel HIV-1 fusion inhibitor derived from CHR-derived peptide (Trp628~Gln653, named CP), but with an innovative Ile-Asp-Leu tail (IDL) that dramatically increased the inhibitory activity by up to 100 folds. We also determined the crystal structures of artificial fusion peptides N36- and N43-L6-CP-IDL. Although the overall structures of both fusion peptides share the canonical six-helix bundle (6-HB) configuration, their IDL tails adopt two different conformations: a one-turn helix with the N36, and a hook-like structure with the longer N43. Structural comparison showed that the hook-like IDL tail possesses a larger interaction interface with NHR than the helical one. Further molecular dynamics simulations of the two 6-HBs and isolated CP-IDL peptides suggested that hook-like form of IDL tail can be stabilized by its binding to NHR trimer. Therefore, CP-IDL has potential for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor, and this strategy could be widely used in developing artificial fusion inhibitors against HIV and other enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2016-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Yun; Su, Shan; Qin, Lili; Wang, Qian; Shi, Lei; Ma, Zhenxuan; Tang, Jianchao; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu; Ye, Sheng; Zhang, Rongguang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bba54a43464e4fda9280139894c5467524ef2faf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5036048.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep31983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27666394/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IDL tails","isolated CP-IDL peptides","form of IDL tail","new HIV fusion inhibitor","artificial fusion inhibitors","effective fusion inhibitors","HIV gp41","hook","novel HIV","crystal structures of artificial fusion peptides N36","Leu tail","CHR-derived peptide","N43-L6","longer N43","overall structures","helix bundle","NHR trimer","development","larger interaction interface","C-terminal heptad repeat","Trp628","HBs","innovative Ile-Asp","configuration","Gln653","potential","different conformations","enveloped viruses","binding","strategy","inhibitory activity","molecular dynamics simulations","challenges","potency","stability","folds","Structural comparison"],"language":"en"},

The most common motifs utilize hybridization to a complementary detection strand coupled with a sensitive reporter molecule. Here, a paper-based colorimetric assay for DNA detection based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-induced nanoparticle aggregation is reported as an alternative to traditional colorimetric approaches. PNA probes are an attractive alternative to DNA and RNA probes because they are chemically and biologically stable, easily synthesized, and hybridize efficiently with the complementary DNA strands. The acpcPNA probe contains a single positive charge from the lysine at C-terminus and causes aggregation of citrate anion-stabilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the absence of complementary DNA. In the presence of target DNA, formation of the anionic DNA-acpcPNA duplex results in dispersion of the AgNPs as a result of electrostatic repulsion, giving rise to a detectable color change. Factors affecting the sensitivity and selectivity of this assay were investigated, including ionic strength, AgNP concentration, PNA concentration, and DNA strand mismatches. The method was used for screening of synthetic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA based on a colorimetric paper-based analytical device developed using the aforementioned principle. The oligonucleotide targets were detected by measuring the color change of AgNPs, giving detection limits of 1.53 (MERS-CoV), 1.27 (MTB), and 1.03 nM (HPV). The acpcPNA probe exhibited high selectivity for the complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch, and noncomplementary DNA targets. The proposed paper-based colorimetric DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative approach for simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective DNA detection.","publish_time":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teengam, Prinjaporn; Siangproh, Weena; Tuantranont, Adisorn; Vilaivan, Tirayut; Chailapakul, Orawon; Henry, Charles S.","journal":"Analytical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/011c7c4ce9ad8c20533be1791a4ff09e3c536532.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077925.xml.json","url":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28394582/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00255","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PNA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["care DNA","selective DNA detection","colorimetric DNA sensor","absence of complementary DNA","complementary DNA strands","DNA strand mismatches","noncomplementary DNA targets","presence of target DNA","colorimetric paper","anionic DNA-acpcPNA duplex results","complementary detection strand","RNA detection","colorimetric assays","detection limits","acpcPNA probe","complementary oligonucleotides","color change of AgNPs","traditional colorimetric approaches","PNA concentration","attractive alternative","MERS-CoV","alternative approach","single-base","base-mismatch","PNA probes","RNA probes","proposed paper","MTB","HPV","detectable color change","AgNP concentration","high selectivity","oligonucleotide targets","single positive charge","development of simple fluorescent","induced nanoparticle aggregation","sensitive reporter molecule","aggregation of citrate anion-stabilized silver nanoparticles","screening of synthetic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid","utility","rise","dispersion","formation","ionic strength","C-terminus","lysine","analytical device","hybridization","point","potential","result of electrostatic repulsion","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","human papillomavirus","topic of significant research","text","resource limited settings","common motifs","aforementioned principle","sensitivity","Image","method","Factors","nM"],"language":"en"},

The dynamics of the airborne propagation and the genetic diversity of S. aureus isolated in an academic dental clinic environment were investigated using isoenzyme typing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The isoenzymes of 44 previously reported isolates were obtained from fresh cultures and extracted using glass beads. Nine isoenzymes were investigated using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). The genetic diversity and relationship among the strains (electrophoretic type \u2013 ET) were determined using statistics previously described by Nei (25) (1972) and the SAHN grouping method (UPGMA algorithm). RESULTS: Clonal pattern analyses indicated a high level of genetic polymorphism occurring among the 33 ETs, which were grouped into five taxa. Each taxon presented one or more clusters that were moderately related and that contained two or more identical/highly related isolates, revealing seasonal airborne propagation in these dental clinic environments. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the occurrence of active microevolutionary processes in S. aureus as well as the possibility of environmental propagation during a 14-month time span. Such findings are important to show that multiuser academic dental clinics can retain certain strains that are spreadable to different niches.","publish_time":"2018-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bernardo, Wagner Luiz de Carvalho; da Silva, Jeferson J\u00FAnior; H\u00F6fling, Jos\u00E9 Francisco; Rosa, Edvaldo Ant\u00F4nio Ribeiro; Boriollo, Marcelo Fabiano Gomes","journal":"J Appl Oral Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53ac5d89055610d2b199e67d8438eba84dbfcf84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5912401.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-7757-2017-0141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29641749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dental treatments","genetic diversity","Staphylococcus aureus strains","dental clinic environments","academic dental clinic environment","certain strains","seasonal airborne propagation","multiuser academic dental clinics","related isolates","isoenzymes","possibility of environmental propagation","high level of genetic polymorphism","reported isolates","important public health problem","Clonal pattern analyses","dentists","fresh cultures","relationship","occurrence of active microevolutionary processes","contamination","data","multilocus enzyme electrophoresis","electrophoretic type","different niches","SAHN","UPGMA algorithm","infection of patients","MLEE","glass beads","RESULTS","month time span","OBJECTIVE","statistics","CONCLUSIONS","clusters","MATERIAL","METHODS","findings","ETs","dynamics","Nei","taxon","taxa"],"language":"en"},

The characteristic clinical features of Kawasaki\u0027s disease are fever \u2265 102\u00B0F for \u2265 5 days accompanied by a bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis/conjunctival suffusion, erythematous rash, cervical adenopathy, pharyngeal erythema, and swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet. Kawasaki\u0027s disease primarily affects children and is rare in adults. In children, Kawasaki\u0027s disease is more likely to be associated with aseptic meningitis, coronary artery aneurysms, and thrombocytosis. In adult Kawasaki\u0027s disease, unilateral cervical adenopathy, arthritis, conjunctival suffusion/conjunctivitis, and elevated serum transaminases (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) are more likely. Kawasaki\u0027s disease in adults may be mimicked by other acute infections with fever and rash, that is, group A streptococcal scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF). Because there are no specific tests for Kawasaki\u0027s disease, diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and the syndromic approach. In addition to rash and fever, scarlet fever is characterized by circumoral pallor, oropharyngeal edema, Pastia\u0027s lines, and peripheral eosinophilia, but not conjunctival suffusion, splenomegaly, swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet, thrombocytosis, or an elevated SGOT/SGPT. In TSS, in addition to rash and fever, there is conjunctival suffusion, oropharyngeal erythema, and edema of the dorsum of the hands/feet, an elevated SGOT/SGPT, and thrombocytopenia. Patients with TSS do not have cervical adenopathy or splenomegaly. RMSF presents with fever and a maculopapular rash that becomes petechial, first appearing on the wrists/ankles after 3 to 5 days. RMSF is accompanied by a prominent headache, periorbital edema, conjunctival suffusion, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, an elevated SGOT/SGPT, swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet, but not oropharyngeal erythema. We present a case of adult Kawasaki\u0027s disease with myocarditis and splenomegaly. The patient\u0027s myocarditis rapidly resolved, and he did not develop coronary artery aneurysms. In addition to splenomegaly, this case of adult Kawasaki\u0027s disease is remarkable because the patient had highly elevated serum ferritin levels of 944-1303 ng/mL; (normal \u003C 189 ng/mL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of adult Kawasaki\u0027s disease with highly elevated serum ferritin levels. This is also the first report of splenomegaly in adult Kawasaki\u0027s disease. We conclude that Kawasaki\u0027s disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in adult patients with rash/fever for \u2265 5 days with conjunctival suffusion, cervical adenopathy, swelling of the dorsum of the hands/feet, thrombocytosis and otherwise unexplained highly elevated ferritin levels.","publish_time":"2009-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, Burke A.; Pherez, Francisco M.; Alexiadis, Varvara; Gagos, Marios; Strollo, Stephanie","journal":"Heart Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abfba729cf9e69e4c3f84749de9e9a1d1096a59e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20207278/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956309001484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.06.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956309001484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever","SGPT","RMSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of adult Kawasaki\u0027s disease","report of adult Kawasaki\u0027s disease","conjunctival suffusion","characteristic clinical features of Kawasaki\u0027s disease","elevated SGOT","disease of unknown cause","feet","dorsum","hands","elevated serum ferritin levels","elevated serum transaminases","elevated ferritin levels","streptococcal scarlet fever","adult patients","report of splenomegaly","SGPT","erythematous rash","maculopapular rash","unilateral cervical adenopathy","oropharyngeal edema","Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever","TSS","oropharyngeal erythema","thrombocytosis","days","RMSF","addition","serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase","serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase","periorbital edema","thrombocytopenia","coronary artery aneurysms","children","adults","differential diagnosis","clinical criteria","patient\u0027s myocarditis","bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis","arthritis","Pastia\u0027s lines","circumoral pallor","toxic shock syndrome","peripheral eosinophilia","prominent headache","aseptic meningitis","specific tests","acute infections","syndromic approach","wrists","knowledge","ankles","best"],"language":"en"},

The cause of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The existence of asymptomatic seroconvertors and the detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in plasma during the course of infection all suggest that SARS could, as least theoretically, be transmitted by transfusion. An estimate of the risk of SARS transmission through blood transfusion will contribute to decisions concerning blood safety monitoring and may be useful in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Study design and methods Case onset dates from the 2003 Shenzhen SARS epidemic and investigational results from Taiwan on viremia in humans are used to estimate the number of cases that were viremic throughout the epidemic. Estimates of the asymptomatic-to-clinically confirmed SARS-CoV infection ratio, the proportion of asymptomatic infections reported in a seroprevalence survey in Hongkong, and the population size of Shenzhen are used to infer the SARS-CoV transfusion\u2013transmission risk. Statistical resampling methods are used. Results Based on data from Shenzhen, Hongkong and Taiwan, the maximum and mean risk (per million) of SARS-CoV transmission from donors in Shenzhen were estimated as 23.57 (95% CI: 6.83\u201347.69) and 14.11 (95% CI: 11.00\u201317.22), respectively. The estimated risk peaked on April 02, 2003. Conclusions Although there are currently no confirmed reports of the transmission of SARS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals, recent research data indicate that transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV is at least theoretically possible. Although the risk is low, with its rapid spread of the disease, appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and high fatality rate, public health authorities need to consider strategies for blood donor recruitment and virus inactivation during an epidemic to further ensure blood safety.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shang, Guifang; Biggerstaff, Brad J.; Yang, Baocheng; Shao, Chaopeng; Farrugia, Albert","journal":"Transfusion and Apheresis Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fc7de662b09794c65b08e0817d24fde149bb8e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106443.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050207001371; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050207001371","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Taiwan","Hongkong","Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV transfusion","transmission of SARS","SARS-CoV transmission","risk of SARS transmission","transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV RNA","Shenzhen SARS epidemic","cause of SARS","risk of transfusion","transmission risk","confirmed SARS-CoV infection ratio","blood transfusion","estimated risk","mean risk","asymptomatic individuals","transmitted infections","proportion of asymptomatic infections","blood safety monitoring","Taiwan","blood donor recruitment","design of strategies","existence of asymptomatic seroconvertors","Hongkong","population size of Shenzhen","high infectivity","investigational results","course of infection","Study design","confirmed reports","high fatality rate","recent research data","recognized infectious disease","Statistical resampling methods","methods Case onset dates","public health authorities","appearance","Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","detection","virus inactivation","outbreak","plasma","decisions","rapid spread","seroprevalence survey","humans","viremia","maximum","donors","number of cases","viremic","novel coronavirus","south China","Conclusions","Estimates"],"language":"en"},

Based on these effects, we therefore postulated the hypothesis that patients with acute bronchitis would also benefit from therapy with Cineole. METHODS: As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center-study, a total of 242 patients with confirmed acute bronchitis was randomly selected to participate. Over a period of 10 days, all patients were administered 3 x 200 mg of Cineole, or a respective placebo, per day. The primary outcome measure was a Bronchitis Sum Score, which summarises the relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis. RESULTS: After 4 days of treatment it was notable, that the patient group treated with Cineole, showed significantly more improvements of the bronchitis-sum-score than those of the placebo group (p = 0.0383). The statistical significant difference of the individual outcome measures was especially underlined by the frequency of cough fits by p = 0.0001 after 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days.

IFs have not only roles in maintaining the structural integrity of the cell, but they are also involved in many cellular processes including cell adhesion, immune signaling, and autophagy, processes that are important in the context of bacterial infections. Here, we summarize the knowledge about the role of IFs in bacterial infections, focusing on the type III IF protein vimentin. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of vimentin in host cell defenses, acting as ligand for several pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system. Two main aspects of bacteria-vimentin interactions are presented in this review: the role of vimentin in pathogen-binding on the cell surface and subsequent bacterial invasion and the interaction of cytosolic vimentin and intracellular pathogens with regards to innate immune signaling. Mechanistic insight is presented involving distinct bacterial virulence factors that target vimentin to subvert its function in order to change the host cell fate in the course of a bacterial infection.","publish_time":"2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mak, Tim N.; Br\u00FCggemann, Holger","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9033d46664d7ded6d2cd79ddb75c2c36beab4802.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4931667.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27096872/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells5020018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["III"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial interaction","bacterial survival","host cell cytoskeleton","host cell defenses","host cell fate","cell surface","role of vimentin","cell adhesion","context of bacterial infections","involvement of vimentin","vimentin interactions","protein vimentin","subsequent bacterial invasion","interaction of cytosolic vimentin","distinct bacterial virulence factors","well-studied bacterial strategies","role of IFs","innate immune system","cellular processes","intracellular pathogens","actin","ligand","regards","pattern recognition receptors","pathogen-binding","order","course","intermediate filaments","components","main aspects of bacteria","autophagy","review","type","Mechanistic insight","roles","structural integrity","replication","dissemination","function","Recent studies","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

ANIMAL STUDIED: Dogs and cats presenting for investigation of anterior uveitis (April 2008\u2013December 2013). PROCEDURES: Aqueous was collected via limbal entry under sedation/general anesthesia, for cytopathology and occasionally bacterial culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Further workup included blood testing (hematology, biochemistry, and serology), diagnostic imaging, nonocular cytopathology, and available histopathology. RESULTS: Fifty\u2010six dogs and 39 cats were included in the study. An aqueous cytopathologic diagnosis of lymphoma (or discrete cell neoplasia) was made in six dogs and seven cats, and a diagnosis of large cell carcinoma made in one dog. This diagnosis of lymphoma was confirmed by ocular histopathology in two dogs and one cat; nonocular cytopathology corroborated lymphoma in another three dogs and five cats. Lymphoma was not evident on aqueous cytopathology but confirmed on nonocular histopathology in two dogs and by cytopathology in one cat. Additionally, aqueous cytopathology in three cats suggested, but was not considered diagnostic of, lymphoma; one of these cats had a confirmatory diagnosis of lymphoma on subsequent clinical investigation. Aqueous humor cytopathology alone was not diagnostic in non\u2010neoplastic anterior uveitis cases, but supplemented the clinical picture with other systemic diagnostic tests. No clinically important complications were reported in association with aqueocentesis. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueocentesis is performed readily with minimal risk. The results were primarily useful in aiding a diagnosis of lymphoma in both dogs and cats.","publish_time":"2014-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linn\u2010Pearl, Rose N.; Powell, Roger M.; Newman, Hayley A.; Gould, David J.","journal":"Vet Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ec828c8d3668e5bac6882c7c4e557bab4f2ff46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169297.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25557502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aqueocentesis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dogs","cats","aqueous cytopathology","nonocular cytopathology corroborated lymphoma","Aqueous humor cytopathology","aqueocentesis cytopathology results","aqueous cytopathologic diagnosis of lymphoma","confirmatory diagnosis of lymphoma","nonocular histopathology","uveitis investigation","investigation of anterior uveitis","diagnostic imaging","diagnosis of large cell carcinoma","subsequent clinical investigation","systemic diagnostic tests","available histopathology","non\u2010neoplastic anterior uveitis cases","clinical picture","blood testing","discrete cell neoplasia","polymerase chain reaction","bacterial culture","limbal entry","general anesthesia","hematology","PCR","sedation","biochemistry","serology","workup","association","OBJECTIVE","important complications","safe procedure","minimal risk","PROCEDURES","ANIMAL","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

This study was designed to examine the effects of sorafenib on macrophages, the major ontogeny of innate immunity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Macrophages were derived from sorted CD14(\u002B) monocytes of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cell viability and surface antigens were examined by trypan blue analysis. Autophagy was characterized by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for morphology, Western blotting for microtubule associated light chain protein 3B (LC-3B) I lipidation, and acridine orange staining for acidic component vacuoles. Soluble factors contained in culture medium and serum were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: We found that sorafenib inhibited the viability of macrophages accompanied by morphological changes characteristic of autophagy. This autophagy-inducing effect was validated by LC3B-I lipidation and autophagosome accumulation. The surface antigen expression and the function of activated macrophages were inhibited by sorafenib, including the expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD80, phagocytosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species. The secretion of IL-10, but not IL-6, TNF-\u03B1 nor TGF-\u03B2, was reduced by sorafenib. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib, in addition to being a cancer targeted therapeutic agent, can induce autophagy and modulate the function of human macrophages.","publish_time":"2013-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Jiunn-Chang; Liu, Chien-Liang; Lee, Jie-Jen; Liu, Tsan-Pai; Ko, Wen-Chin; Huang, Yu-Chuen; Wu, Chih-Hsiung; Chen, Yu-Jen","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1612baee210878f1ee35103be54173bc29281b80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106104.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576913000209; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2013.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23337882/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576913000209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sorafenib"],"organizations":["ELISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viability of macrophages","effects of sorafenib","function of human macrophages","function of activated macrophages","light microscopy","lipidation","Cell viability","morphological changes characteristic of autophagy","surface antigen expression","surface antigens","dendritic cells","secretion of IL","transmission electron microscopy","light chain protein","monocytes of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma","expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD80","Western blotting","microtubule","morphology","acridine orange staining","phagocytosis","multi-kinase inhibitor","acidic component vacuoles","culture medium","major ontogeny of innate immunity","serum","LC3B","TNF-\u03B1","malignancies","addition","sorted CD14","production of reactive oxygen species","trypan blue analysis","Soluble factors","TGF-\u03B2","therapeutic agent","cancer","autophagosome accumulation","METHODS","BACKGROUND","ELISA","modulator","MATERIALS","CONCLUSION","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Findings are based on qualitative research consisting of semi-structured interviews with industry leaders from assorted sectors. Tourism in Penang emerges as vulnerable to regional and global events which act as a trigger for tourism crises, demanding a response in which various strategies are employed. The destination is also seen to recover fairly quickly from experiences of crises, but a well designed and formulated tourism crisis management plan under the stewardship of the public sector is necessary to mitigate further damage in the future.","publish_time":"2012-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghaderi, Zahed; Mat Som, Ahmad Puad; Henderson, Joan C.","journal":"Tour Manag Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50ee50868ba3b31b9b67b4bbfbed49e2615f2e7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147625.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2012.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289006/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221197361200030X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221197361200030X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South East Asia"],"keyphrases":["tourism crises","issues of tourism crisis management","formulated tourism crisis management plan","response strategies","experiences of crises","number of severe crises","industry leaders","industry practice","popular Malaysian destination of Penang","various strategies","specific reference","semi-structured interviews","stewardship","increasing attention","subject of academic enquiry","qualitative research","assorted sectors","global events","public sector","recent years","trigger","paper","damage","South East Asia","Findings","future","organisations"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000\u20135,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the full-length genome sequences of the Chinese IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I and its embryo-passaged, attenuated level to identify sequence substitutions responsible for the attenuation and define markers of attenuation. METHODS: The full-length genomes of CK/CH/LDL/97I P5 and P115 were amplified and sequenced. The sequences were assembled and compared using the MEGALIGN program (DNAStar) and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4 software. RESULTS: The CK/CH/LDL/97I virus population contained subpopulations with a mixture of genetic mutants. Changes were observed in nsp4, nsp9, nsp11/12, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, and ORF3a, but these did not result in amino acid substitutions or did not show functional variations. Amino acid substitutions occurred in the remaining genes between P5 and P115; most were found in the S region, and some of the nucleotide mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions. Among the 9 nsps in the ORF1 region, nsp3 contained the most nucleotide substitutions. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence variations in different genes, especially the S gene and nsp3, in the genomes of CK/CH/LDL/97I viruses might contribute to differences in viral replication, pathogenicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and tissue tropism.","publish_time":"2014-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Fei; Han, Zongxi; Zhang, Tingting; Shao, Yuhao; Kong, Xiangang; Ma, Huijie; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98aea99719ff99b2447abd6a0401b91658fded25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179551.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000365193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LDL","amino acid substitutions","nucleotide substitutions","full-length genomes of CK","sequence substitutions responsible","Chinese IBV strain CK","nsp3","virus population","Sequence variations","P5","P115","S region","infectious bronchitis virus","full-length genome sequences","homologous pathogenic virus","different genes","remaining genes","nucleotide mutations","markers of attenuation","S gene","attenuated level","ORF1 region","functional variations","antigenicity","immunogenicity","pathogenicity","viral replication","subpopulations","phylogenetic tree","nsp9","nsp15","DNAStar","nsp11","nsp14","differences","CONCLUSIONS","viruses","mixture of genetic mutants","nsp4","nsp16","MEGA4 software","tissue tropism","protection","nsps","embryo","METHODS","MEGALIGN program","Changes","ORF3a","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES: Published articles identified through Medline (1980\u20132003) using the search terms zinc, rhinovirus, and other pertinent subject headings. Additional sources were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION: By the author. DATA EXTRACTION: By the author. DATA SYNTHESIS: Human rhinoviruses, by attaching to the nasal epithelium via the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptor, cause most colds. Ionic zinc, based on its electrical charge, also has an affinity for ICAM-1 receptor sites and may exert an antiviral effect by attaching to the ICAM-1 receptors in the rhinovirus structure and nasal epithelial cells. Clinical tests of zinc for treatment of common colds have been inconsistent, primarily because of study design, blinding, and lozenge contents. Early formulations of lozenges also were unpalatable. In three trials with similar study designs, methodologies, and efficacy assessments, zinc effectively and significantly shortened the duration of the common cold when it was administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Recent reports of trials with zinc gluconate administered as a nasal gel have supported these findings; in addition, they have shown that treatment with zinc nasal gel is effective in reducing the duration and severity of common cold symptoms in patients with established illness. CONCLUSION: Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms. Additional clinical and laboratory evaluations are warranted to further define the role of ionic zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms through which zinc exerts its symptom-relieving effects.","publish_time":"2015-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hulisz, Darrell","journal":"J Am Pharm Assoc (2003)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18c823ca3451f8fe8d352b82a0602c18cafaf4fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185598.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319115317908; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319115317908","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zinc gluconate","zinc nasal gel","Clinical tests of zinc","severity of common cold symptoms","onset of common cold symptoms","medicinal value of zinc","role of ionic zinc","treatment of common colds","search terms zinc","severity of symptoms","duration","ICAM","Clinical trial data","onset of symptoms","DATA SOURCES","nasal epithelium","clinical evidence","DATA SYNTHESIS","DATA EXTRACTION","nasal epithelial cells","STUDY SELECTION","hours","Additional sources","author","similar study designs","rhinovirus structure","receptor sites","Published articles","laboratory evaluations","retrieved articles","Recent reports of trials","methodologies","patients","prevention","affinity","intracellular adhesion molecule","efficacy assessments","established illness","blinding","bibliographies","receptors","biochemical mechanisms","lozenge contents","antiviral effect","Human rhinoviruses","electrical charge","pertinent subject headings","symptom-relieving effects","Early formulations of lozenges","Medline","findings","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus2. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Kangpeng; Zhai, Junqiong; Feng, Yaoyu; Zhou, Niu; Zhang, Xu; Zou, Jie-Jian; Li, Na; Guo, Yaqiong; Li, Xiaobing; Shen, Xuejuan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Shu, Fanfan; Huang, Wanyi; Li, Yu; Zhang, Ziding; Chen, Rui-Ai; Wu, Ya-Jiang; Peng, Shi-Ming; Huang, Mian; Xie, Wei-Jun; Cai, Qin-Hui; Hou, Fang-Hui; Liu, Yahong; Chen, Wu; Xiao, Lihua; Shen, Yongyi","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.951335","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["nCoV","Pangolin-CoV","Bat-CoV","identified coronavirus","SARS-CoV","S protein","new coronavirus","S genes","amino acid identity","Infected pangolins","Malayan pangolins","identified bat coronavirus2","amino acid difference","reservoir host","intermediate host","poses unprecedent public health challenges","high sequence identity","end","histopathological changes","continuous threat","China","clinical signs","circulating antibodies","central Chinese city of Wuhan","receptor-binding domain","wildlife trade","trafficked mammal","various coronaviruses","potential","RaTG13","recombination","Comparison of available genomes","rest world1","bats","animals","study","hosts","isolation","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety margins for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), parvovirus B19, and variant form of Creutzfeldt\u2010Jakob disease (vCJD) were calculated for the two fibrin sealants licensed in the United States and for thrombin. These products were selected because their use in a clinical setting is, in most cases, optional, and both were relatively recently approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, thrombin and fibrinogen both undergo two dedicated virus inactivation steps and/or removal steps in accord with the recommendations of regulatory agencies worldwide. Safety margins were determined by comparing the potential maximum viral loads in contaminated units to viral clearance factors, ultimately leading to the calculation of the residual risk per vial. RESULTS: The residual risk of pathogen transmission per vial was calculated to be less than 1 in 10(\u221215) for HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV for both fibrinogen and thrombin. Owing to the greater quantities that can be present and its greater thermal stability, the calculated risk for parvovirus transmission was 1 in 500,000 vials for fibrinogen and less than 1 in 10(7) per vial for thrombin. Assuming that vCJD is found to be present in plasma donations, its risk of transmission by these purified and processed plasma derivatives would appear to be very low. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen safety initiatives implemented by plasma fractionators over the past 10 to 20 years have resulted in products with excellent pathogen safety profiles. Of the agents examined, parvovirus continues to have the lowest calculated margin of safety. Despite this, parvovirus transmissions should be rare. Manufacturers are encouraged to continue exploring processes to further enlarge parvovirus safety margins and to continue exploring ways of eliminating prions.","publish_time":"2008-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horowitz, Bernard; Busch, Michael","journal":"Transfusion","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99a6b47fe248c7fd014ccabba681871bc5308c99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18466171/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01717.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["parvovirus safety margins","risk of transmission","pathogen safety initiatives","probability of safety","calculated risk","thrombin","residual risk of pathogen transmission","excellent pathogen safety profiles","lowest calculated margin of safety","hepatitis C virus","hepatitis B virus","likelihood of pathogen transmission","parvovirus B19","Plasma fractionators","parvovirus transmissions","fibrinogen","plasma donations","human immunodeficiency virus","dedicated virus inactivation steps","HIV","HCV","HBV","improvements","HAV","processed plasma derivatives","blood products","vCJD","removal steps","past decade","greater quantities","viral clearance factors","greater thermal stability","potential maximum viral loads","contaminated units","METHODS","variant form of Creutzfeldt\u2010Jakob disease","US Food","accord","Drug Administration","FDA","United States","STUDY DESIGN","calculation","processes","recommendations of regulatory agencies","cases","clinical setting","fibrin sealants","marketing","use","final product","years","ways","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","vials","overall impact","BACKGROUND","prions","Manufacturers","agents"],"language":"en"},

This study was aimed to investigate the roles of host differentially expressed genes on metabolic pathways in PDCoV infections. RESULTS: Twenty thousand six hundred seventy-four differentially expressed mRNAs were identified in 5-day-old piglets responded to PDCoV experimental infections. Many of these genes were correlated to the basic metabolism, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway which plays a critical role in digestion. At the same time, in the PPAR pathway genes of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family members were observed with remarkably differential expressions. The differential expressed genes were associated with appetite decrease and weight loss of PDCoV- affected piglets. DISCUSSION: Fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) and fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) were found to be regulated by PDCoV. These two genes not only mediate fatty acid transportation to different cell organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisome, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus, but also modulate fatty acid metabolism and storage as a signaling molecule outside the cell. Therefore, it can be preliminarily concluded that PPAR differential expression caused by PDCoV was mostly associated with weight loss and death from emaciation. CONCLUSIONS: The host differentially expressed genes were associated with infection response, metabolism signaling and organismal systems signaling pathways. The genes of FABP family members in the PPAR signaling pathway were the most highly altered and played important roles in metabolism. Alteration of these genes were most likely the reason of weight loss and other clinical symptoms. Our results provided new insights into the metabolic mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.

We describe the occurrence of an outbreak among HCWs and attempt to characterize at-risk exposures to improve future infection control interventions. Methods This study included an index case and all HCW contacts. All contacts were screened for MERS-CoV using polymerase chain reaction. Results During the study period in 2015, the index case was a 30-year-old Filipino nurse who had a history of unprotected exposure to a MERS-CoV\u2013positive case on May 15, 2015, and had multiple negative tests for MERS-CoV. Weeks later, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and MERS-CoV infection. A total of 73 staff were quarantined for 14 days, and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on days 2, 5, and 12 postexposure. Of those contacts, 3 (4%) were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. An additional 18 staff were quarantined and had MERS-CoV swabs. A fourth case was confirmed positive on day 12. Subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth-generation transmission. Only 7 (4.5%) of the total 153 contacts were positive for MERS-CoV. Conclusions The role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission is complex. Although most MERS-CoV\u2013infected HCWs are asymptomatic or have mild disease, fatal infections can occur and HCWs can play a major role in propagating health care facility outbreaks. This investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission in health care outbreaks, especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposures, who to test, and the frequency of MERS-CoV testing; criteria for who to quarantine and for how long; and clearance and return to active duty criteria.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfaraj, Sarah H.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Altuwaijri, Talal A.; Alanazi, Marzouqa; Alzahrani, Nojoom; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6afa8c5639ac39717e68778d7637ac300fe4c2e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115310.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655317309574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28958446/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655317309574; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2017.08.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV transmission","MERS-CoV swabs","frequency of MERS","CoV testing","role of HCWs","positive case","health care outbreaks","infected HCWs","health care settings","index case","propagating health care facility outbreaks","involved health care workers","HCW contacts","major role","infection control guidance","generation transmission","days","staff","total","future infection control interventions","at-risk exposures","complex questions","study period","nasopharyngeal swabs","outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","definition of risky exposures","active duty criteria","mild disease","history of unprotected exposure","fatal infections","year-old Filipino nurse","need","multiple negative tests","polymerase chain reaction","pulmonary tuberculosis","Subsequent contact investigations","clearance","Methods","Conclusions","Results","occurrence","postexposure","Weeks"],"language":"en"},

Different morphological settings and variable biogeophysical conditions characterize this continuously evolving system that rapidly responds to the anthropic impacts. When the lockdown measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 10th 2020, the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice, one of the major pressures in the lagoon, came to a halt. This provided a unique opportunity to analyse the environmental effects of restrictions to mobility on water transparency. Pseudo true-colour composites Sentinel-2 satellite imagery proved useful for qualitative visual interpretation, showing the reduction of the vessel traffic and their wakes from the periods before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. A quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns, based on satellite-derived turbidity, in the absence of traffic perturbations, allowed to focus on natural processes and the residual stress from human activities that continued throughout the lockdown. We conclude that the high water transparency can be considered as a transient condition determined by a combination of natural seasonal factors and the effects of COVID-19 restrictions.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braga, Federica; Scarpa, Gian Marco; Brando, Vittorio Ernesto; Manf\u00E8, Giorgia; Zaggia, Luca","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba2c172b833bfc0f5ba3ebca59088878aaaf29dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720331326?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720331326; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139612","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ordinary urban water traffic","vessel traffic","high water transparency","SARS-CoV","lagoon of Venice","environmental effects of restrictions","absence of traffic perturbations","satellite imagery","effects of COVID","natural processes","lockdown measures","satellite-derived turbidity","combination of natural seasonal factors","variable biogeophysical conditions","anthropogenic stressors","qualitative visual interpretation","Pseudo true-colour composites Sentinel","regional geomorphological evolution","Different morphological settings","residual stress","reduction","mobility","quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns","global changes","human activities","evolving system","Italy","transient condition","unique opportunity","wakes","spread","major pressures","periods","infection","outbreak","anthropic impacts","halt"],"language":"en"},

Ferrets are carnivorous and require a suitable diet. A diet that is high in good-quality animal protein and fat and low in complex carbohydrates and fiber is recommended. Ferrets are routinely immunized against canine distemper virus (CDV) and rabies virus. Ferrets are quite susceptible to CDV, and there is a 100% mortality rate in unvaccinated ferrets infected with CDV. When a new ferret is brought into the household, a quarantine period is recommended before introducing it to other animals, particularly other ferrets. The purpose of the quarantine period is to identify and prevent transmission of infectious disease potentially carried by the new ferret. The duration of this period allows for the development of any clinical signs in a seemingly healthy ferret following entrance into the new household.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolf, Tiffany M.","journal":"Manual of Exotic Pet Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/869e9185cd78de0100e9eec5765160273aa5b2bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170204.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500160","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unvaccinated ferrets","new ferret","healthy ferret","CDV","new household","quarantine period","basic knowledge of ferret biology","short ears","rabies virus","suitable diet","short muscular legs","canine distemper virus","fat","veterinarians","good-quality animal protein","medicine","tail","slender body","chapter","small eyes","complex carbohydrates","clinical signs","surgery","entrance","Publisher Summary","mortality rate","transmission of infectious disease","fiber","development","difficulty","temperatures","care","appropriate precautions","life span","purpose","extreme weather","exposure","extremes","duration","years","animals","groups"],"language":"en"},

HYPOTHESIS: Broadly reactive PCR might aid in the identification of infectious agents in GME and NME. ANIMALS: Sixty\u2010eight client\u2010owned dogs evaluated by necropsy at 1 university referral hospital. METHODS: A mixed prospective/retrospective case\u2010control study was performed. Brain tissue prospectively collected at necropsy from GME, NME, and control cases was evaluated by broadly reactive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for adenoviruses, bunyaviruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, flaviviruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses, and parechoviruses. In addition, these tissues were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of mycoplasmas by PCR, culture, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: Brain tissue was collected from 11 GME and 27 NME cases and 30 controls. Viral nucleic acids were not identified in the 6 GME cases, 25 NME cases, and 2 controls evaluated by viral PCR. Mycoplasma canis was identified by Mycoplasma genus PCR in 1/5 GME and 4/25 NME cases and subsequently was cultured from 4/5 GME and 4/8 NME cases as well as 2/9 controls. The IHC did not detect M. canis in any of the 11 GME and 27 NME cases or 14 controls evaluated with strain PG14 polyclonal antiserum. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The negative results suggest that viral pathogens are not common in the brain tissue of dogs with GME and NME.

Methods According to the clinical characteristics and initial laboratory findings of 175 suspected cases defined by the WHO criteria (20 confirmed as cases of SARS) in 3 university teaching hospitals in Taipei between March 1 and April 20, 2003, the scoring system for SARS was designed by multivariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression as the simple arithmetic sum of point values assigned to 7 parameters. We thereafter applied the scoring system for SARS to the consecutive 232 patients (the validation group) who met the WHO criteria of suspected cases from April 21 to May 22, 2003. Final diagnosis of SARS was determined by the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction and paired serum. Results The scoring system for SARS was defined as radiographic findings of multilobar or bilateral infiltrates (3 points), sputum monocyte predominance (3 points), lymphocytopenia (2 points), history of exposure (1 point), lactate dehydrogenase more than 450 U/L (1 point), C-reactive protein more than 5.0 mg/dL (1 point), and activated partial prothrombin time more than 40 seconds (1 point). Of the validation group, 60 patients (group A) were confirmed as having cases of SARS, and the other 172 (group B) patients tested negative for SARS. The total points of the scoring system for SARS at initial presentation were significantly higher in the SARS group (median 9; range 6 to 11) than in the non-SARS group (median 4; range 3 to 7; P\u003C.001). At the cutoff value of 6 points, the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for SARS in diagnosing SARS were 100% and 93%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the scoring system for SARS were 83% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion The scoring system for SARS can provide a rapid and reliable clinical decision to help emergency physicians detect cases of SARS more accurately in the endemic area.","publish_time":"2004-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Tzong-Luen; Jang, Tsrang-Neng; Huang, Chien-Hsien; Kao, Shang-Jyh; Lin, Chor-Ming; Lee, Fang-Niarn; Liu, Cheng-Yao; Chong, Chee-Fah; Lin, Chu-Mei; Dorji, Harnod; Teng, Hsueh-Ju; Chang, Hang","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50a80ee3c43a0cf9389b0d0b40c13b7e32fd798a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135684.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064403008254; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064403008254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of SARS","diagnosing SARS","scoring system","non-SARS group","Final diagnosis of SARS","validation group","group B","criteria of suspected cases","total points","patients","simple arithmetic sum of point values","specificity","sensitivity","range","reliable clinical decision","initial laboratory findings","negative predictive values","initial presentation","clinical characteristics","absence of reliable rapid confirmatory tests","radiographic findings of multilobar","Abstract Study objective","phase cohort study","results of real-time polymerase chain reaction","severe acute respiratory syndrome","stepwise logistic regression","emergency physicians","bilateral infiltrates","multivariate analysis","paired serum","World Health Organization","sputum monocyte predominance","university teaching hospitals","seconds","endemics","history of exposure","lymphocytopenia","partial prothrombin time","lactate dehydrogenase","Taipei","C-reactive protein","Conclusion","cutoff value","Methods","endemic area","parameters"],"language":"en"},

Presently, the malady is being treated by focusing on Renin- angiotensin system (RAS), voltage-gated calcium channels, peripheral vasodilators, renal and sympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular and renal abnormalities are associated with the overactivation of RAS, which can be constrained by angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II (Ang-II) -AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. The latter is a new player in the old system. The renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang-I). This can be overcome by inhibiting renin, a preliminary step, eventually hinders the occurrence of the cascade of events in the RAS. Various peptidomimetics, the first-generation renin inhibitors developed six decades ago have limited drug-like properties as they suffered from poor intestinal absorption, high liver first-pass metabolism and low oral bioavailability. The development of chemically diverse molecules from peptides to nonpeptides expanded the horizon to achieving direct renin inhibition. Aliskiren, a blockbuster drug that emerged as a clinical candidate and got approved by the US FDA in 2007 was developed by molecular modeling studies. Aliskiren indicated superior to average efficacy and with minor adverse effects relative to other RAS inhibitors. However, its therapeutic use is limited by poor oral bioavailability of less than 2% that is similar to first-generation peptidic compounds. In this review, we present the development of direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) from peptidic to nonpeptidics that lead to the birth of aliskiren, its place in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and its limitations.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramya, Krishnappa; Suresh, Ramalingam; Kumar, Honnavalli Yogish; Kumar, B.

These pathways act in concert to mediate innate antiviral immunity and to initiate the inflammatory response against infection. The RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a group of cytosolic RNA helicase proteins that can identify viral RNA as nonself via binding to pathogen associated molecular patter (PAMP) motifs within RNA ligands that accumulate during virus infection. This interaction then leads to triggering of an innate antiviral response within the infected cells through RLR induction of downstream effector molecules such as type I interferon (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that serve to induce antiviral and inflammatory gene expression within the local tissue. Cellular regulation of RLR signaling is a critical process that can direct the outcome of infection and is essential for governance of the overall immune response and avoidance of immune toxicity. Mechanisms of positive and negative regulation of RLR signaling have been identified that include signaling crosstalk between RLR pathways and Nuclear Oligomerization Domain (NOD)-Like Receptor (NLR) pathways and Caspase networks. Furthermore, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to target these pathways to promote enhanced replication and spread within the host. These virus-host interactions therefore carry important consequences for host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Understanding the pivotal role of RLRs in immune regulation and signaling crosstalk in antiviral immunity may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for the control of virus infection and immunity.","publish_time":"2011-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramos, Hilario J; Gale, Michael","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db15bc2f35f9715994b2a1699e9cd0a5f0889a93.json; document_parses/pdf_json/144b4bcac126bb577d000cc7b9443f069f84c43a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3177754.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625711000058; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3177754?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2011.04.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625711000058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21949557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RLR pathways","host immunity","immune regulation","innate antiviral immunity","control of virus infection","innate antiviral response","negative regulation of RLR","Cellular regulation of RLR","inflammatory response","pathways act","virus-host interactions","outcome of infection","overall immune response","viral RNA","multiple immune","host cell","infected cells","RNA ligands","avoidance of immune toxicity","crosstalk","infected tissue","RLR induction of downstream effector molecules","inflammatory gene expression","pro-inflammatory cytokines","bystander cells","viral pathogenesis","local tissue","Mechanisms of positive","evolved mechanisms","group of cytosolic RNA helicase proteins","important consequences","PRRs","molecular patter","PAMP","binding","NOD","therapeutic strategies","new insights","Nuclear Oligomerization Domain","family of pattern recognition receptors","motifs","nonself","NLR","governance","concert","pivotal role of RLRs","interferon","IFN","Caspase networks","critical process","enhanced replication","viruses","RIG"],"language":"en"},

Persistently symptomatic patients worsen with a disabling, potentially fatal clinical course. To determine a possible infectious cause, we correlated in a case-control study the clinical information with the presence of bacterial DNA in sarcoidosis mediastinal lymph nodes compared with control lymph nodes resected during cancer surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively studied formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, mediastinal lymph nodes from 30 patients with sarcoidosis and 30 control patients with lung cancer. Nucleic acids were extracted from nodes, evaluated by ribosomal RNA PCR for bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA and the results were sequenced and compared with a bacterial sequence library. Clinical information was correlated. RESULTS: 11/30 (36.7%) of lymph nodes from patients with sarcoidosis had detectable bacterial DNA, significantly more than control patient lymph nodes (2/30, 6.7%), p=0.00516. At presentation, 19/30 (63.3%) patients with sarcoidosis were symptomatic including all patients with detectable bacterial DNA. Radiographically, there were 18 stage I and 12 stage II patients. All stage II patients were symptomatic and 75% had PCR-detectable bacteria. After a mean follow-up of 52.8\u00B132.8 months, all patients with PCR-detectable bacteria in this series were persistently symptomatic requiring treatment. DISCUSSION: 36.6% of patients with sarcoidosis had detectable bacterial DNA on presentation, all of these patients were quite symptomatic and most were radiographically advanced stage II. These findings suggest that bacterial DNA-positive, symptomatic patients have more aggressive sarcoidosis that persists long term and might benefit from antimicrobial treatment directed against this presumed chronic granulomatous infection.","publish_time":"2013-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robinson, Lary A; Smith, Prudence; SenGupta, Dhruba J; Prentice, Jennifer L; Sandin, Ramon L","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6b4bc9d758eb2542292da9540b16861b6e1b023.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9a494f17a77c5920be077ac59abc8a7546f4ee67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3884606.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24366580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sarcoidosis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptomatic patients","control patients","detectable bacterial DNA","control lymph nodes","sarcoidosis mediastinal lymph nodes","presence of bacterial DNA","bacterial DNA-positive","control patient lymph nodes","aggressive sarcoidosis","lymph nodes of unknown aetiology","PCR-detectable bacteria","S ribosomal DNA","bacterial sequence library","symptomatic requiring treatment","clinical information","advanced stage","case-control study","ribosomal RNA PCR","presentation","results","chronic granulomatous disease","fatal clinical course","presumed chronic granulomatous infection","antimicrobial treatment","cancer surgery","lung cancer","lungs","series","non-specific anti-inflammatory","incurable","disabling","long term","months","paraffin","immunosuppressive drugs","findings","possible infectious cause","formalin","mean follow-up","Nucleic acids","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

Nucleolin (NCL) is a cellular protein reported for its functions upon G4 recognition, such as induction of neurodegenerative diseases, tumor and virus mechanisms activation. We here aimed at defining NCL/G4 binding determinants. METHODS: Electrophoresis mobility shift assay was used to detect NCL/G4 binding; circular dichroism to assess G4 folding, topology and stability; dimethylsulfate footprinting to detect G bases involved in G4 folding. RESULTS: The purified full-length human NCL was initially tested on telomeric G4 target sequences to allow for modulation of loop, conformation, length, G-tract number, stability. G4s in promoter regions with more complex sequences were next employed. We found that NCL binding to G4s heavily relies on G4 loop length, independently of the conformation and oligonucleotide/loop sequence. Low stability G4s are preferred. When alternative G4 conformations are possible, those with longer loops are preferred upon binding to NCL, even if G-tracts need to be spared from G4 folding. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide insight into how G4s and the associated proteins may control the ON/OFF molecular switch to several pathological processes, including neurodegeneration, tumor and virus activation. Understanding these regulatory determinants is the first step towards the development of targeted therapies. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The indication that NCL binding preferentially stimulates and induces folding of G4s containing long loops suggests NCL ability to modify the overall structure and steric hindrance of the involved nucleic acid regions. This protein-induced modification of the G4 structure may represent a cellular mechanosensor mechanism to molecular signaling and disease pathogenesis.

Its application fields range from medical research, to drug discovery, to epidemiology, to population dynamics. The literature on molecular phylogenetics proposes a number of criteria for selecting a phylogeny from among plausible alternatives. Usually, such criteria can be expressed by means of objective functions, and the phylogenies that optimize them are referred to as optimal. One of the most important estimation criteria is the parsimony which states that the optimal phylogeny T(\u2217)for a set [Formula: see text] of n haplotype sequences over a common set of variable loci is the one that satisfies the following requirements: (i) it has the shortest length and (ii) it is such that, for each pair of distinct haplotypes [Formula: see text] , the sum of the edge weights belonging to the path from h(i) to h(j) in T(\u2217) is not smaller than the observed number of changes between h(i) and h(j). Finding the most parsimonious phylogeny for [Formula: see text] involves solving an optimization problem, called the Most Parsimonious Phylogeny Estimation Problem (MPPEP), which is [Formula: see text]-hard in many of its versions. RESULTS: In this article we investigate a recent version of the MPPEP that arises when input data consist of single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes extracted from a population of individuals on a common genomic region. Specifically, we explore the prospects for improving on the implicit enumeration strategy of implicit enumeration strategy used in previous work using a novel problem formulation and a series of strengthening valid inequalities and preliminary symmetry breaking constraints to more precisely bound the solution space and accelerate implicit enumeration of possible optimal phylogenies. We present the basic formulation and then introduce a series of provable valid constraints to reduce the solution space. We then prove that these constraints can often lead to significant reductions in the gap between the optimal solution and its non-integral linear programming bound relative to the prior art as well as often substantially faster processing of moderately hard problem instances. CONCLUSION: We provide an indication of the conditions under which such an optimal enumeration approach is likely to be feasible, suggesting that these strategies are usable for relatively large numbers of taxa, although with stricter limits on numbers of variable sites. The work thus provides methodology suitable for provably optimal solution of some harder instances that resist all prior approaches.","publish_time":"2013-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Catanzaro, Daniele; Ravi, Ramamoorthi; Schwartz, Russell","journal":"Algorithms Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3599976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23343437/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-7188-8-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Phylogeny"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal solution","optimal phylogeny T","text","optimal enumeration approach","Parsimonious Phylogeny Estimation Problem","implicit enumeration of possible optimal phylogenies","implicit enumeration strategy of implicit enumeration strategy","solution space","hard problem instances","optimization problem","number of criteria","novel problem formulation","important estimation criteria","series of provable valid constraints","MPPEP","common set of variable loci","n haplotype sequences","aligned haplotype sequences","numbers of variable sites","valid inequalities","previous work","preliminary symmetry breaking constraints","input data","population of individuals","harder instances","prior art","population dynamics","recent years","prior approaches","basic formulation","recent version","large numbers of taxa","common genomic region","observed number of changes","pair of distinct haplotypes","single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes","fine-scale genetic data","non-integral linear programming","stricter limits","medical research","analysis","parsimony","drug discovery","faster processing","epidemiology","importance","strategies","molecular phylogenetics","gap","BACKGROUND","methodology suitable","edge weights","significant reductions","application fields","article","literature","path","sum","attention","conditions","indication","objective functions","plausible alternatives","prospects","following requirements","shortest length","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","versions"],"language":"en"},

Together, our data identify Trex1 as a regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and IFN-independent activation of antiviral genes, and shows dysregulation of lysosomes can elicit innate immune responses.","publish_time":"2012-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasan, Maroof; Koch, James; Rakheja, Dinesh; Pattnaik, Asit K.; Brugarolas, James; Dozmorov, Igor; Levine, Beth; Wakeland, Edward K.; Lee-kirsch, Min Ae; Yan, Nan","journal":"Nat Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35c420fb4598e8d833173d957564539f37162d0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3522772.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160154/; https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.2475","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-independent activation of antiviral genes","Trex1-deficient cells","IFN-independent pathways","TREX1-mutant human cells","cytosolic exonuclease Trex1","high levels of antiviral genes","interferon-stimulated genes","multifaceted antiviral response","subset of ISGs","innate immune responses","viral infections","Innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids triggers","expanded lysosomal compartment","regulator of lysosomal biogenesis","subcellular localization","TFEB","transcription factor EB","dysregulation of lysosomes","mouse","STING","TBK1","IRF3","precise mechanisms","production","reduced mTORC1 activity","IRF7","data"],"language":"en"},

At first, it was thought that the patients who use immunmodulator therapy could be even at higher risks of disease complications. However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis. Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. Methods : In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. Results : Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia. He was discharged to home-quarantine with no symptoms. Discussion : This report supports the idea of using type 1 interferon in the treatment could be effective in COVID-19 affected patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"GEMCIOGLU, Emin; DAVUTOGLU, Mehmet; OZDEMIR, Ese Ece; ERDEN, Abdulsamet","journal":"Multiple sclerosis and related disorders","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e054b957dcf1bbe3131832b290d4d49e01c2ad25.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820302728; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820302728?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","elderly patients","affected patients","interferon","type","symptoms","report","immunmodulators","immunmodulator therapy","potential treatment","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","pandemic reasoned respiratory insufficiency","high risk","death","SARS-CoV","idea","multiple sclerosis","higher risks of disease complications","advantage","hospitalization","Abstract Background","comorbidities","elevated D-dimer","clinical prognosis","paper","home-quarantine","Discussion","identification","China","Methods","lymphopenia","Results"],"language":"en"},

He infected 26 cases in Hospital C, and consecutive nosocomial transmission proceeded throughout the nation. We provide an epidemiologic description of the outbreak, as of July 2015. METHODS: Epidemiological research was performed by direct interview of the confirmed patients and reviewing medical records. We also analyzed the incubation period, serial interval, the characteristics of superspreaders, and factors associated with mortality. Full genome sequence was obtained from sputum specimens of the index patient. RESULTS: A total of 186 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection across 16 hospitals were identified in the Republic of Korea. Some 44.1% of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8% were caregivers, and 13.4% were healthcare personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills. The estimated incubation period was 6.83 days and the serial interval was 12.5 days. A total of 83.2% of the transmission events were epidemiologically linked to five superspreaders, all of whom had pneumonia at presentation and contacted hundreds of people. Older age [odds ratio (OR) = 4.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90\u201312.45] and underlying respiratory disease (OR = 4.90, 95% CI 1.64\u201314.65) were significantly associated with mortality. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the MERS-CoV of the index case clustered closest with a recent virus from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: A single imported MERS-CoV infection case imposed a huge threat to public health and safety. This highlights the importance of robust preparedness and optimal infection prevention control. The lessons learned from the current outbreak will contribute to more up-to-date guidelines and global health security.","publish_time":"2015-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Osong Public Health Res Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd6a6cd1c453c47af156f6e42ba837207ab45c63.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a58220fe30325ce4b67376b18556722c2192c990.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4588443.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2015.08.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221090991530045X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221090991530045X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Republic of Korea","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["single imported MERS-CoV infection case","confirmed patients","serial interval","index case clustered closest","fever","index patient","current outbreak","days","hospitals","confidence interval","Republic of Korea","cases","total","mortality","outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","optimal infection prevention control","estimated incubation period","public health","characteristics of superspreaders","respiratory disease","transmission events","consecutive nosocomial transmission","global health security","recent virus","huge threat","up-to-date guidelines","importance of robust preparedness","Riyadh","sputum specimens","Hospital C","direct interview","presentation","Epidemiological research","Saudi Arabia","pneumonia","common presenting symptom","chills","safety","contacted hundreds of people","Older age","odds ratio","genome sequence","nation","factors","CONCLUSION","medical records","OBJECTIVES","Phylogenetic analysis","METHODS","caregivers","epidemiologic description","lessons","RESULTS","healthcare personnel"],"language":"en"},

However, the regulatory mechanisms of these \u0022histone codes\u0022 in plants remain largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that a salinity stress inducible PHD (plant homeodomain) finger domain containing protein GmPHD5 can read the \u0022histone code\u0022 underlying the methylated H3K4. GmPHD5 interacts with other DNA binding proteins, including GmGNAT1 (an acetyl transferase), GmElongin A (a transcription elongation factor) and GmISWI (a chromatin remodeling protein). Our results suggest that GmPHD5 can recognize specific histone methylated H3K4, with preference to di-methylated H3K4. Here, we illustrate that the interaction between GmPHD5 and GmGNAT1 is regulated by the self-acetylation of GmGNAT1, which can also acetylate histone H3. GmGNAT1 exhibits a preference toward acetylated histone H3K14. These results suggest a histone crosstalk between methylated H3K4 and acetylated H3K14. Consistent to its putative roles in gene regulation under salinity stress, we showed that GmPHD5 can bind to the promoters of some confirmed salinity inducible genes in soybean. CONCLUSION: Here, we propose a model suggesting that the nuclear protein GmPHD5 is capable of regulating the crosstalk between histone methylation and histone acetylation of different lysine residues. Nevertheless, GmPHD5 could also recruit chromatin remodeling factors and transcription factors of salt stress inducible genes to regulate their expression in response to salinity stress.","publish_time":"2011-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Tao; Pi, Er-Xu; Tsai, Sau-Na; Lam, Hon-Ming; Sun, Sai-Ming; Kwan, Yiu Wa; Ngai, Sai-Ming","journal":"BMC Plant Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f62efb20f820241aeb1a8e16af68502fedc9b43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3288756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22168212/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-11-178","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["histone crosstalk","histone methylation","histone codes","specific histone methylated H3K4","acetylated histone H3K14","nuclear protein GmPHD5","salinity stress inducible PHD","RESULTS","specific patterns of histone posttranslational modifications","histone acetylation of different lysine residues","confirmed salinity inducible genes","transcription factors of salt stress inducible genes","chromatin remodeling protein","self-acetylation of GmGNAT1","chromatin remodeling factors","preference","acetylated H3K14","transcription elongation factor","plant homeodomain","finger domain","GmISWI","expression","putative roles","gene regulation","GmElongin","PTMs","promoters","Accumulated evidence","DNA binding proteins","crosstalks","soybean","response","time","acetyl transferase","BACKGROUND","plants","regulatory mechanisms","transcriptional outcomes","interaction","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We reported the first Hong Kong patient without risk factors for severe A(H7N9) disease. METHODS: Direct sequencing was performed on the endotracheal aspirate collected from a 36-year-old female with history of poultry contact. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to compare the current strain and previous A(H7N9) isolates. RESULTS: The influenza A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus strain was detected in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, deranged liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia, and rhabdomyolysis. The HA, NA and MP genes of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with those of other human A(H7N9) strains. The PB1, PB2 and NS genes are most closely related to those of A/Guangdong/1/2013 strain identified in August 2013, but are distinct from those of other human and avian A(H7N9) strains. The other internal genes NP and PA genes are more closely related to those of non-A(H7N9) avian influenza A viruses. A unique PA L336M mutation, associated with increased polymerase activity, was found. The patient required salvage by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: The A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus is a novel reassortant derived from A/Guangdong/1/2013 virus.

Very little is known about the host pathways that regulate the stability of CoV mRNAs, which carry some unusual features. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic RNA surveillance pathway that detects mRNAs harboring aberrant features and targets them for degradation. Although CoV mRNAs are of cytoplasmic origin, the presence of several NMD-inducing features (including multiple ORFs with internal termination codons that create a long 3\u2032 untranslated region) in CoV mRNAs led us to explore the interplay between the NMD pathway and CoVs. Our study using murine hepatitis virus as a model CoV showed that CoV mRNAs are recognized by the NMD pathway as a substrate, resulting in their degradation. Furthermore, CoV replication induced the inhibition of the NMD pathway, and N protein (a viral structural protein) had an NMD inhibitory function that protected viral mRNAs from rapid decay. Our data further suggest that the NMD pathway interferes with optimal viral replication by degrading viral mRNAs early in infection, before sufficient accumulation of N protein. Our study presents clear evidence for the biological importance of the NMD pathway in controlling the stability of mRNAs and the efficiency of replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus.","publish_time":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wada, Masami; Lokugamage, Kumari G.; Nakagawa, Keisuke; Narayanan, Krishna; Makino, Shinji","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3d86967ec5f08ad06752781d947283ac4434e8d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1124c1e10cc4c2274b4e328c53347c34ed77727f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6205489.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30297408/; https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/43/E10157.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811675115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["NMD pathway","viral mRNAs","stability of CoV mRNAs","CoV replication","stability of mRNAs","model CoV","NMD inhibitory function","eukaryotic RNA surveillance pathway","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","viral structural protein","optimal viral replication","cytoplasmic RNA virus","enveloped RNA viruses","efficiency of replication","aberrant features","CoVs","unusual features","study","degradation","sufficient accumulation of N protein","cytoplasmic origin","rapid decay","large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome","murine hepatitis virus","Nonsense-mediated decay","variety of diseases","multiple ORFs","internal termination codons","biological importance","infection","humans","clear evidence","presence","untranslated region","interplay","inhibition","domestic animals","substrate","host pathways","Coronaviruses","data"],"language":"en"},

The role of the HE protein during the torovirus infection cycle remains unknown, although it is believed to be important in the natural infection process. The phylogenetic analysis of HE coding sequences from porcine torovirus (PToV) field strains revealed the existence of two distinct HE lineages.

Many other arboviruses have since emerged from their sylvatic reservoirs and dispersed globally due to evolving factors that include anthropological behaviour, commercial transportation and land-remediation. Here, we outline some characteristics of these highly divergent arboviruses, including the variety of life cycles they have developed and the mechanisms by which they have adapted to evolving changes in habitat and host availability. We cite recent examples of virus emergence that exemplify how arboviruses have exploited the consequences of the modern human lifestyle. Using our current understanding of these viruses, we also attempt to demonstrate some of the limitations encountered in developing control strategies to reduce the impact of future emerging arbovirus diseases. Finally, we present recommendations for development by an international panel of experts reporting directly to World Health Organization, with the intention of providing internationally acceptable guidelines for improving emerging arbovirus disease control strategies. Success in these aims should alleviate the suffering and costs encountered during recent decades when arboviruses have emerged from their sylvatic environment.","publish_time":"2015-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Guodong; Gao, Xiaoyan; Gould, Ernest A","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1951545d70e8568083cde219d2583c1aae0c4061.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4395659.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2015.18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038768/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["divergent arboviruses","dengue virus","recent examples of virus emergence","emerging arbovirus disease control strategies","yellow fever virus","developing control strategies","New World","recorded emergence","recent decades","evolving factors","sylvatic reservoirs","sylvatic environment","impact of future emerging arbovirus diseases","World Health Organization","anthropological behaviour","commercial transportation","acceptable guidelines","international panel of experts","development","intention","costs","land-remediation","suffering","consequences","arthropod","present recommendations","variety of life cycles","Slave trading of Africans","Americas","changes","habitat","host availability","modern human lifestyle","aims","limitations","century","current understanding","characteristics","mechanisms","Success"],"language":"en"},

However, it does occur with common mild to severe ailments afflicting the world population. Several allopathic medicines are available to attenuate fever by targeting the pathogen or the symptom itself. However, many people in marginal civilizations are obligated to use locally grown medicinal plants due to limited access to common pharmaceuticals. The Karen ethnic group is the biggest ethnic minority group in the hill-tribes of Thailand. They utilise a vast repertoire of medicinal plant species. Since many modern drugs were discovered out of traditional therapies, it is possible to discover new allopathic drugs in the treatment of fever and associated pathogens from the Karen people. Thus, this study aims to identify and record the ethnomedicinal plants they used for the treatment of \u0022fever\u0022. The names of plants used by the Thai Karen people for the treatment of fever were mined from publications on ethnomedicinal uses. Useful plant species and families were identified using the Cultural Importance Index (CI). With the mined data, 125 plant species from 52 families were identified, distributed across 25 Karen villages. A chemical cross-examination of these species provided valuable insights into chemical classes worthy of further investigation in the context of fever and associated pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phumthum, Methee; Sadgrove, Nicholas J","journal":"Antibiotics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics9050220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Karen"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["treatment of fever","context of fever","Karen ethnic group","Useful plant species","Thai Karen people","Karen villages","ethnomedicinal plants","vast repertoire of medicinal plant species","associated pathogens","families","names of plants","symptom","new allopathic drugs","biggest ethnic minority group","chemical cross-examination","allopathic medicines","common pharmaceuticals","modern drugs","mined data","chemical classes worthy","valuable insights","severe ailments","hill-tribes","investigation","limited access","Cultural Importance Index","world population","traditional therapies","publications","Thailand","marginal civilizations","terminal condition","study"],"language":"en"},

The study aimed to investigate the frequency of porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) and its coinfection with canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) in dogs in the Guangxi province from 2015 to 2017, China, and to examine the genome diversity of PCV3. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing, 96 of 406 (23.6%)samples were positive for PCV3, 38 out of 406 (9.4%) samples were coinfected with both PCV3 and CPV-2. The CPV-positive rate was significantly higher in the PCV3-positive samples than in the non-PCV3 samples, and the difference was extremely significant (P \u003C 0.01). The complete genome (n=4) and ten capsid genes (n=10) of PCV3 were sequenced. Multiple sequence alignment results showed that these sequences shared 98.5\u2013100% nucleotide similarity with the reference genome sequence and 97.5\u2013100% nucleotide similarity with the reference capsid gene sequence. PCV3 was classified into two different genotypes, according to phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome. These strains were clustered in PCV3a, showing a close relationship with PCV3-US/SD2016. Surprisingly, we separately analyzed these PCV3 strains from the Guangxi province and found that the dog and pig PCV3 are from different branches. In summary, this was the first seroprevalence and genetic investigation of PCV3 in dogs in the Guangxi province, China, and the first complete genome PCV3 from dogs obtained in the world. The results provide insights into the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this important virus.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Wenchao; Wang, Wei; Xin, Jialiang; Cao, Liang; Zhuang, Xinyu; Zhang, Cong; Zhu, Yilong; Zhang, He; Qin, Yuhao; Du, Qian; Han, Zhixiao; Lu, Huijun; Zheng, Min; Jin, Ningyi","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31035ba89e852edc635738e995d6ed27a2652921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114628.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301332/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219301935; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219301935","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangxi","China"],"keyphrases":["PCV3 strains","PCV3-US","pig PCV3","PCV3-positive samples","complete genome PCV3","genome diversity of PCV3","non-PCV3 samples","genetic investigation of PCV3","reference genome sequence","dogs","Guangxi province","CPV-positive rate","nucleotide similarity","reference capsid gene sequence","Abstract Porcine circovirus type","frequency of porcine circovirus","China","Multiple sequence alignment results","emerging circovirus species","different genotypes","different branches","capsid genes","canine parvovirus type","PCR","amplification","epidemiology","difference","close relationship","polymerase chain reaction","pathogenesis","seroprevalence","phylogenetic analysis","sequences","coinfection","important virus","sequencing","insights","PCV3a","diseases","SD2016","world","summary","study"],"language":"en"},

Identifying possible routes of the airborne transmission and predicting the potential infection risk are meaningful for infectious disease control. In the present study, an internal spread route between horizontal adjacent flats induced by air infiltration was investigated. On-site measurements were conducted, and tracer gas technique was employed. Two measurement scenarios, closed window mode and open window mode, were compared. Using the calculated air change rate and mass fraction, the cross-infection risk was estimated using the Wells\u2013Riley model. It found that tracer gas concentrations in receptor rooms are one order lower than the source room, and the infection risks are also one order lower. Opening windows results in larger air change rate on the one hand, but higher mass fraction on the other hand. Higher mass fraction not necessarily results in higher infection risk as the pathogen concentration in the source room is reduced by the higher air change rate. In the present study, opening windows could significantly reduce the infection risk of the index room but slightly reduce the risks in receptor rooms. The mass fraction of air originated from the index room to the receptor units could be 0.28 and the relative cross-infection risk through the internal transmission route could be 9%, which are higher than the external spread through single-sided window flush.

The nature of the coronavirus genome is nonsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA. Its size ranges from 27 to 32 kb, which is significantly larger when compared with other RNA viruses. The gene encoding the large surface glycoprotein is up to 4.4 kb, encoding an imposing trimeric, highly glycosylated protein. This soars some 20 nm above the virion envelope, giving the virus the appearance-with a little imagination-of a crown or coronet. Coronavirus research has contributed to the understanding of many aspects of molecular biology in general, such as the mechanism of RNA synthesis, translational control, and protein transport and processing.

Abstract Mucosal epithelial interfaces, essential for a proper interaction of the individual with the environment of the digestive, respiratory or reproductive tracts, are protected by a powerful immune system that appears more and more sophisticated and controlled. This system involves the newly described cells and molecules of innate immunity, which appear phylogenetically highly conserved. Mucosae are moreover seeded by immunocompetent cells (antigen presenting cells, B and T lymphocytes), that traffic between the major inductive sites of Peyer\u0027s patches, and diversified effector sites. These cells elaborate original effector and regulatory molecules (secretory IgA, cytokines, chemokines). This complex and tightly controlled system is usually quite silent. Specific pathologies may however develop, the exploration of which being progressively more possible. Increasing knowledge about the mucosae associated immune system suggests that new treatments with mucosal impact should develop in the future.","publish_time":"2000-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00E9n\u00E9, Marie-Christine; Faure, Gilbert C.","journal":"Revue Fran\u00E7aise des Laboratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00e7a32a8286cd9eb5b2b570fba0417547863f18.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0338989800802279; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0338989800802279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Il","Les"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellules et","\u00E9labor\u00E9 et contr\u00F4l\u00E9","pathologies sp\u00E9cifiques et","controlled system","sites effecteurs diversifi\u00E9s et produisant","described cells","immunocompetent cells","mol\u00E9cules effectrices et r\u00E9gulatrices originales","powerful immune system","cellules immunitaires","diversified effector sites","cytokines","mucosal impact","chemokines","Mucosae","Cet ensemble complexe est physiologiquement particuli\u00E8rement contr\u00F4l\u00E9 et reste habituellement silencieux","cellules pr\u00E9sentatrices d\u0027antig\u00E8ne","interfaces \u00E9pith\u00E9liales muqueuses","sont d\u00E9fendues par","muqueuses sont d\u0027autre","ensemble physiologique","secretory IgA","IgA s\u00E9cr\u00E9toires","regulatory molecules","Il peut n\u00E9anmoins \u00EAtre","T lymphocytes","Abstract Mucosal epithelial interfaces","plus en","original effector","Specific pathologies","\u00E0 pouvoir \u00EAtre explor\u00E9 biologiquement","major inductive sites of Peyer\u0027s patches","modalit\u00E9s th\u00E9rapeutiques nouvelles \u00E0 impact muqueux","lign\u00E9es lymphocytaires T","molecules of innate immunity","Il comporte une participation efficace","indispensables aux relations","respiratoire","connaissance r\u00E9cente","l\u0027organisme avec son environnement digestif","syst\u00E8me immunitaire apparaissant","reproductif","si\u00E8ge","l\u0027immunit\u00E9 inn\u00E9e","connaissances fait esp\u00E9rer","mobiles entre","site inducteur principal","plaques","colonis\u00E9es","mais phylog\u00E9n\u00E9tiquement tr\u00E8s ancien","new treatments","digestive","proper interaction","traffic","antigen","environment","individual","progr\u00E8s","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","reproductive tracts","knowledge","exploration","future"],"language":"en"},

We observed a distinctive dual peak pattern of influenza epidemic during the A/H1N1 2009pdm in Beijing, China, which was formed by the A/H1N1 2009pdm, and a subsequent influenza B epidemic in year 2009/2010.

Parallel detection of multiple respiratory viruses shows that the epidemic of common respiratory viruses, except human rhinovirus, was delayed during the pandemic of the A/H1N1 2009pdm. The H1N1 2009pdm mainly caused upper respiratory tract infections in the sampled patients; patients infected with H1N1 2009pdm had a higher percentage of cough than those infected with seasonal influenza or other respiratory viruses.

In most cases, severe clinical signs caused by such virus infections are normally not seen in bats. This indicates differences in the virus-host interactions and underlines the necessity to develop natural host related models to study these phenomena. Due to the strict protection of European bat species, immortalized cell lines are the only alternative to investigate the innate anti-virus immune mechanisms. Here, we report about the establishment and functional characterization of Myotis myotis derived cell lines from different tissues: brain (MmBr), tonsil (MmTo), peritoneal cavity (MmPca), nasal epithelium (MmNep) and nervus olfactorius (MmNol) after immortalization by SV 40 large T antigen. The usefulness of these cell lines to study antiviral responses has been confirmed by analysis of their susceptibility to lyssavirus infection and the mRNA patterns of immune-relevant genes after poly I:C stimulation. Performed experiments indicated varying susceptibility to lyssavirus infection with MmBr being considerably less susceptible than the other cell lines. Further investigation demonstrated a strong activation of interferon mediated antiviral response in MmBr contributing to its resistance. The pattern recognition receptors: RIG-I and MDA5 were highly up-regulated during rabies virus infection in MmBr, suggesting their involvement in promotion of antiviral responses. The presence of CD14 and CD68 in MmBr suggested MmBr cells are microglia-like cells which play a key role in host defense against infections in the central nervous system (CNS). Thus the expression pattern of MmBr combined with the observed limitation of lyssavirus replication underpin a protective mechanism of the CNS controlling the lyssavirus infection. Overall, the established cell lines are important tools to analyze antiviral innate immunity in M. myotis against neurotropic virus infections and present a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of future investigations in cellular biology of M. myotis.","publish_time":"2014-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Xiaocui; Koryt\u00E1\u0159, Tom\u00E1\u0161; Zhu, Yaqing; Pikula, Ji\u0159\u00ED; Bandouchova, Hana; Zukal, Jan; K\u00F6llner, Bernd","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19e9c8796df362aa81ecfabf7730cfa4df5e5be6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4190323.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25295526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SV","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MmBr cells","lyssavirus infection","immortalized cell lines","established cell lines","expression pattern of MmBr","rabies virus infection","functional characterization of Myotis myotis derived cell lines","neurotropic virus infections","virus-host interactions","study antiviral responses","antiviral innate immunity","promotion of antiviral responses","innate anti-virus immune mechanisms","host defense","CNS","Bats","observed limitation of lyssavirus replication","natural host related models","varying susceptibility","natural reservoirs","mRNA patterns of immune","pattern recognition receptors","different tissues","immortalization","important tools","relevant genes","broad spectrum of future investigations","MmNep","MmPca","nasal epithelium","strict protection of European bat species","valuable tool","necessity","brain","alternative","peritoneal cavity","nervus olfactorius","cellular biology","strong activation of interferon","SV","MmNol","poly","MmTo","tonsil","central nervous system","protective mechanism","key role","CD68","involvement","analysis","severe clinical signs","large T antigen","RIG","establishment","experiments","microglia","C stimulation","presence of CD14","cases","emerging viruses","phenomena","differences","usefulness","MDA5","resistance"],"language":"en"},

These foci are transient and dynamic, and contain components of the cellular translation machinery as well as certain mRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Stress granules are known to be induced by conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress, and a number of cellular factors have been identified that are commonly associated with these foci. More recently it was discovered that poliovirus infection also induces the formation of stress granules, although these cytoplasmic foci appear to be somewhat compositionally unique. Work described here examined the punctate pattern of SRp20 (a host cell mRNA splicing protein) localization in the cytoplasm of poliovirus-infected cells, demonstrating the partial co-localization of SRp20 with the stress granule marker protein TIA-1. We determined that SRp20 does not co-localize with TIA-1, however, under conditions of oxidative stress, indicating that the close association of these two proteins during poliovirus infection is not representative of a general response to cellular stress. We confirmed that the expression of a dominant negative version of TIA-1 (TIA-1-PRD) results in the dissociation of stress granules. Finally, we demonstrated that expression of wild type TIA-1 or dominant negative TIA-1-PRD in cells during poliovirus infection does not dramatically affect viral translation.

Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. SUMMARY: For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wei; Zhang, Shuping; Nekhai, Sergei; Liu, Sijin","journal":"Curr Clin Microbiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f858b22a381595d78a50ff529481cc66688e6c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169647.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-020-00140-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["iron chelation","iron regulation","intracellular iron efflux","conditions of iron overload","iron chelator deferiprone","key iron regulators","venous injection of iron chelators","increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression","patients","COVID","viral infections","infections of viruses","REVIEW","immunodeficiency syndrome","ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia","human immunodeficiency virus","promising adjuvant strategy","alternative beneficial adjuvant","antiviral effect","oral uptake","manipulation","CoVs","HIV","AIDS","example","treatment","enzymes","SARS-CoV","China","survival","RECENT FINDINGS","poor prognosis","widespread concerns","replication process","coronaviruses","PURPOSE","implications","metals","therapeutic options","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

The application of classical computational methodologies, such as molecular docking, for the rational development of RNA-binding candidates is, however, complicated by the peculiarities characterizing these macromolecules, such as the marked conformational flexibility, the singular charges distribution, and the relevant role of solvent molecules. In this work, we have thus validated and extended the applicability domain of SuMD, an all-atoms molecular dynamics protocol that allows to accelerate the sampling of molecular recognition events on a nanosecond timescale, to ribonucleotide targets of pharmaceutical interest.

In addition, some of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were up-regulated in the early infection stage without obvious expression of IFN-\u03B2. Moreover, we show that activation of IFN responses induced by poly(I:C) could inhibit viral replication in the early infection stage, but failed in the late infection stage in IPEC-J2 cells.

Rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are critical to the diagnosis and control of the disease. A specific one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) assay for detection and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues was developed using a dual-labeled fluorescent probe. The fluorogenic probe labeled with a reporter dye (FAM, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamin) and a quencher dye (AbsoluteQuencher\u2122) was designed to bind to a 186 base-pair fragment flanked by the two PCR primers targeting the 3\u2032 end of spike gene of TCoV. The assay was performed on different avian viruses and bacteria to determine the specificity as well as serial dilutions of TCoV for the sensitivity. Three animal trials were conducted to further validate the assay. Ten-day-old turkey poults were inoculated orally with 100 EID50 of TCoV. Intestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum), feces from the cloacal swabs, or feces from the floor were collected at 12h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and/or 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to the RRT-PCR. The designed primers and probe were specific for TCoV. Other non-TCoV avian viruses and bacteria were not amplified by RRT-PCR. The assay was highly sensitive and could quantitate between 102 and 1010 copies/\u03BCl of viral genome. The viral RNA in the intestine segments reached the highest level, 6\u00D71015 copies/\u03BCl, in the jejunum at 5 DPI. Eighty-four intestine segments assayed by the developed RRT-PCR and immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) revealed that there were 6 segments negative for TCoV by both assays, 45 positive for TCoV by IFA, and 77 positive for TCoV by RRT-PCR. Turkey coronavirus was detected in the feces from the cloacal swabs or floor 1\u201314 DPI; however, the viral RNA load varied among different turkey poults at different intervals from different trials. The highest amount of viral RNA, 2.8\u00D71010 copies/\u03BCl, in the feces was the one from the cloacal swab collected at 1 DPI. The average amount of TCoV RNA in the cloacal fecal samples was 10 times higher than that in the fecal droppings on the floor. Taken together, the results indicated that the developed RRT-PCR assay is rapid, sensitive, and specific for detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues and should be helpful in monitoring the progression of TCoV induced acute enteritis in the turkey flocks.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yi-Ning; Wu, Ching Ching; Bryan, Thomas; Hooper, Tom; Schrader, Donna; Lin, Tsang Long","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef78166253de329621b80f8ea193609d0330f0b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112835.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19917315/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409004820; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.11.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409004820","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["Turkey"],"keyphrases":["TCoV RNA","quantitation of TCoV","progression of TCoV","EID50 of TCoV","turkey tissues","developed RRT-PCR assay","different turkey poults","serial dilutions of TCoV","turkey industry","turkey flocks","non-TCoV avian viruses","PCR primers","end of spike gene of TCoV","Abstract Turkey coronavirus","feces","day-old turkey poults","viral RNA load","different trials","copies","cloacal swabs","floor","different avian viruses","immunofluorescence antibody assay","\u03BCl of viral genome","different intervals","Rapid detection","intestine segments","cloacal fecal samples","acute enteritis","bacteria","IFA","differentiation","Intestinal tissues","jejunum","fluorogenic probe","fluorescent probe","designed primers","acute atrophic enteritis","fecal droppings","reporter dye","quencher dye","highest level","animal trials","specific one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","infection","times higher","significant economic loss","duodenum","ileum","cecum","carboxytetramethylrhodamin","specificity","diagnosis","assays","control","FAM","base-pair fragment","sensitivity","days post-inoculation","disease","AbsoluteQuencher","results"],"language":"en"},

We also noted that a \u0394MN mutant lacking both MA and NC produces a relatively higher amount of VLPs than those in which MA was substituted for NC. Although \u0394MN contains approximately 30% the RNA of wt, it still exhibits virion densities equal (or very similar) to those of wt. The data suggest that neither NC nor RNA are major virion density determinants. Furthermore, we noted that NC(ZIP)\u2014a NC replacement with a leucine zipper dimerization motif\u2014produces VLPs as efficiently as wt. However, the markedly reduced assembly efficiency of NC(ZIP) is associated with the formation of VLPs with densities slightly lower than those of wt following MA removal, suggesting that (a) MA is required to help the inserted leucine zipper motif perform efficient Gag multimerization, and (b) MA plays a role in the virus assembly process.","publish_time":"2008-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Ching-Yuan; Chang, Yu-Fen; Wang, Shiu-Mei; Tseng, Ying-Tzu; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Wang, Chin-Tien","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f774a2decc541f4bf1265b269e37ae9c0753a321.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103396.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208003395; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208003395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550141/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.05.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["MA"],"organizations":["NC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NC results","NC replacement","RNA of wt","MA removal","wt level","level RNA","reduced assembly efficiency of NC","RNA content","lower densities","formation of VLPs","virion densities equal","inserted leucine zipper motif","leucine zipper dimerization motif","virus assembly process","VLP production","production of wild type","\u0394MN mutant lacking","major virion density determinants","efficient Gag multimerization","form virions","proteins","self-interaction","propensity","role","nucleocapsid","association","matrix","substitute","particles","constructs","finding","contrast","HIV","data"],"language":"en"},

We reported here a new method for sequence comparison. It considers whole distribution of dual bases and employs polar coordinates method to map a biological sequence into a closed curve. The curve tree was then constructed to numerically characterize the closed curve of biological sequences, and further compared biological sequences by evaluating the distance of the curve tree of the query sequence matching against a corresponding curve tree of the template sequence. The proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis, and its performance was further compared with alignment-based methods.

Indeed neurotropic animal viruses are currently used to study demyelination in well-established models, but animal models of demyelination by human virus infection have only recently been developed, using animal gammaherpesviruses closely related to Epstein Barr virus (EBV), or using marmosets expressing the specific viral receptor for Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). The present review will illustrate the main potential mechanisms of MS pathogenesis possibly associated with viral infections and viruses currently used to study demyelination in animal models.

Systematic tests where the performance of alternative physico-chemical disinfection methods is systematically compared and optimized must be based on reliable protocols. These protocol are currently not adequately addressing the neutralization related issues: the neutralization of the tested disinfectant after specified conditions of concentration and contact time (CT) is necessary to prevent continued disinfection after the intended contact time; moreover such neutralization is often necessary in practice and on a large scale to prevent adverse health and ecological impacts from remaining disinfectant after the target CT is achieved. Few studies adequately assess the extent of neutralization of the chemical disinfectant and are intended to optimize on-site disinfection practices for waste matrices posing high microbial risks. Hence, there is a need for effective and reproducible neutralization protocols in chemical disinfection trials and practice. Furthermore, for most of chemical disinfectants used in healthcare settings there is no practical methodology to reliably and conveniently measure the residual disinfectant concentration after its neutralization and also determine the optimum concentration of the neutralizer. Because some neutralizing compounds can themselves be toxic to the test microorganisms, it is necessary to optimize neutralization procedures in disinfection experiments for the development of infection control practices using accepted positive control microbes. In the presented work, a stepwise bioassay-based protocol using representative faecal indicator microbes is described for optimizing chemical disinfection and subsequent disinfectant neutralization of any infectious faecal waste matrix. The example described is for the quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride and its recommended chemical neutralizer in a high strength human faecal waste matrix.","publish_time":"2018-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sozzi, Emanuele; Baloch, Mahnoor; Strasser, Joseph; Fisher, Michael B.; Leifels, Mats; Camacho, Juan; Mishal, Nadia; Elmes, Sam F.; Allen, Grace; Gadai, Gregory; Valenti, Lexi; Sobsey, Mark D.","journal":"Int J Hyg Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27ad6787fac866ead3cb1407e86cb57653c17cc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30424942/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463917307332; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463917307332; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2018.07.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chemical disinfection trials","subsequent disinfectant neutralization","neutralization procedures","extent of neutralization","disinfection experiments","continued disinfection","chemical disinfectants","reproducible neutralization protocols","situ physico-chemical disinfection of high risk faecal waste","recommended chemical neutralizer","on-site disinfection practices","neutralization related issues","performance of alternative physico-chemical disinfection methods","tested disinfectant","residual disinfectant concentration","infectious faecal waste matrix","high strength human faecal waste matrix","waste matrices","development of infection control practices","representative faecal indicator microbes","conditions of concentration","intended contact time","optimum concentration","accepted positive control microbes","high microbial risks","infection prevention","stepwise bioassay-based protocol","target CT","reliable protocols","adverse health","quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride","ecological impacts","large scale","healthcare settings","sanitation management strategy","need","presented work","Systematic tests","practical methodology","test microorganisms","neutralizing compounds","example","studies"],"language":"en"},

The results suggest that the domain conferring the ability to direct VLP assembly and release in SARS-CoV N is largely contained between residues 168 and 421.","publish_time":"2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shui-Mei; Chang, Yu-Fen; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Wang, Chin-Tien","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088652.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18592403/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11373-008-9265-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N residues","N carboxyl-terminal half sequence","N amino-terminal half sequence","wt HIV","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid","efficient VLP production","replacement of NC","NC replacement","VLP assembly","different N-coding sequences","production of wild type","wild-type levels","domain","production of substantial amounts of VLPs","direct virus","Analysis results","level virus","levels comparable","release","chimeras","self-interaction capacity","capabilities","particles","ability","density"],"language":"en"},

However, there is substantial uncertainty about the degree and direction of influence owing to different definitions of genetic variation, most of which are not in line with the current understanding of the genetic architecture of disease traits. Also, the relevance of previous results for diseases transmitted through environmental sources is unclear. In this article a compartmental genetic\u2013epidemiological model was developed to quantify the impact of host genetic diversity on epidemiological characteristics of diseases transmitted through a contaminated environment. The model was parameterized for footrot in sheep. Genetic variation was defined through continuous distributions with varying shape and degree of dispersion for different disease traits. The model predicts a strong impact of genetic heterogeneity on the disease risk and its progression and severity, as well as on observable host phenotypes, when dispersion in key epidemiological parameters is high. The impact of host variation depends on the disease trait for which variation occurs and on environmental conditions affecting pathogen survival. In particular, compared to homogeneous populations with the same average susceptibility, disease risk and severity are substantially higher in populations containing a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals, and the differences are strongest when environmental contamination is low. The implications of our results for the recording and analysis of disease data and for predicting response to selection are discussed.","publish_time":"2011-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doeschl-Wilson, Andrea B.; Davidson, R.; Conington, J.; Roughsedge, T.; Hutchings, M.

Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8(\u002B) lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8(\u002B) and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8(\u002B) cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8(\u002B) cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8(\u002B) T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD(\u002B) T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 \u002B T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon \u03B1, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Kashir, Junaid","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/568be1a46f91475fda7b87320b66d9733a44c5cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344314/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720306241; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109777; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720306241","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NK cells of COVID","NK group","Cytotoxic T-cells","NK cell function","NK cytokine secretion","effective immune response","compromised innate immune response","severe COVID","Overexpression of NKG2A","NKG2A overexpression","function of CD8","over-expressing NKG2A","weakened immune system","infected patients","cases of severe infection","functional exhaustion","cancers","SARS-CoV","healthy individuals","tumor progression","disease progression","mild infection","tumor growth","healthy controls","use of Monalizumab","resultant disease","effects","inhibitory signalling","host","CTLs","lower lymphocyte","chloroquine","receptor","overrides","viruses","Natural Killer","higher neutrophil","interferon \u03B1","Phase","novel coronavirus","member","clinical trials","outbreak","studies","proposed mechanism","cytotoxicity","inhibiting antibody","viral pathogen","lymphocytes","antiviral agents","blood"],"language":"en"},

The virus-induced host inflammatory response in the nasopharynx plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AOM. Suppression of this inflammatory process might prevent the development of AOM as a complication. Objective: We sought to assess the effect of intranasally administered fluticasone propionate on prevention of AOM during a viral respiratory infection. Methods: A total of 210 children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 0.7-3.9 years) with normal middle ear status and URI of 48 hours\u2019 duration or less were randomly allocated to receive either fluticasone (100 \u03BCg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days. The specific viral cause of the infection was determined from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained at the first visit. The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period. Results: In the fluticasone group AOM developed in 40 (38.1%) of 105 children compared with 29 (28.2%) of 103 children receiving placebo (P = .13). The viral cause of the respiratory infection was determined in 167 (86.1%) of 194 children from whom a nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained. In children with rhinovirus infection, AOM developed significantly more often in the fluticasone group (45.7%) than in the placebo group (14.7%, P = .005). Conclusion: Intranasally administered fluticasone does not prevent the development of AOM during URI but may increase the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infection.

The aim of this study was to identify the lincRNA profile in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and evaluate their potential role in host-pathogen interaction. The majority of previous RNA-Seq transcriptome studies in Ae. aegypti have focused on the expression pattern of annotated protein coding genes under different biological conditions. Here, we used 35 publically available RNA-Seq datasets with relatively high depth to screen the Ae. aegypti genome for lincRNA discovery. This led to the identification of 3,482 putative lincRNAs. These lincRNA genes displayed a slightly lower GC content and shorter transcript lengths compared to protein-encoding genes. Ae. aegypti lincRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species such as Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae. We examined their expression in dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Wolbachia infected and non-infected adult mosquitoes and Aa20 cells. The results revealed that DENV-2 infection increased the abundance of a number of host lincRNAs, from which some suppress viral replication in mosquito cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of lincRNA_1317 led to enhancement in viral replication, which possibly indicates its potential involvement in the host anti-viral defense.

In addition, we find that human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) also takes advantage of the ER to form IBs and that these IBs are also enriched with PI4P.

In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of 17 common respiratory pathogens in children (\u226414 years old) with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China over a 3-year period using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pathogens were identified in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients, and the positivity rate varied seasonally. Ten of the 17 pathogens investigated showed positivity rates of more than 5%. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (768/2361, 32.5%), influenza A virus (428/2361, 18.1%), enterovirus (138/2361, 13.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (267/2361, 11.3%) and adenovirus (213/2361, 9.0%). Co-pathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive samples. When ranked according to frequency of occurrence, the pattern of co-pathogens was similar to that of the primary pathogens, with the exception of human bocavirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. Significant differences were found in age prevalence in 10 of the 17 pathogens (p\u22640.009): four basic patterns were observed, A: detection rates increased with age, B: detection rates declined with age, C: the detection rate showed distinct peaks or D: numbers of patients were too low to detect a trend or showed no significant difference among age groups (p\u003E0.05).

Single approaches to the study of reservoirs are unlikely to generate conclusive insights whereas the formal integration of data and methodologies, involving interventions, pathogen genetics, and contemporary surveillance techniques, promises to open up new opportunities to advance understanding of complex multihost systems.","publish_time":"2014-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viana, Mafalda; Mancy, Rebecca; Biek, Roman; Cleaveland, Sarah; Cross, Paul C.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Haydon, Daniel T.","journal":"Trends in Ecology \u0026 Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e862e55ef8b64c35c4fee7da8a1d04a699d57f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4007595.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169534714000603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726345/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714000603; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2014.03.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of reservoirs","reservoirs function","identification of infection reservoirs crucial","effective interventions","understanding of complex multihost systems","mechanistic understanding","crucial role","pathogen genetics","methodologies","conclusive insights","quasi-experimental studies","prevalence","adaptive management frameworks","formal integration of data","contemporary surveillance techniques","patterns of incidence","new opportunities","recent scientific advances","conceptual framework","Single approaches","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

One health is a concept that was officially adopted by international organizations and scholarly bodies in 1984. It is the notion of combining human, animal, and environmental components to address global health challenges that have an ecological interconnectedness. Methods. A cross-sectional study of the available literature cited was conducted from January 1984 when the one health concept was adopted till December 2012 to examine the role of the one health approach towards zoonoses. Inclusion criteria included publications, professional presentations, funding allocations, official documentation books, and book chapters, and exclusion criteria included those citations written outside the period of review. Results. A total of 737 resources met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this review. Resources showed a continuous upward trend for the years from 2006 to 2012. The predominant resources were journal publications with environmental health as the significant scope focus for one health. There was also an emphasis on the distribution of the work from developed countries. All categories of years, resources, scopes, and country locale differed from the means (P = 0.000). Year of initiative, scope, and country locale showed a dependent relationship (P = 0.022, P = 0.003, and P = 0.021, resp.). Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate the rapid growth in embracing the concept of one health, particularly in developed countries over the past six years. The advantages and benefits of this approach in tackling zoonoses are manifold, yet they are still not seemingly being embraced in developing countries where zoonoses have the greatest impact.","publish_time":"2014-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bidaisee, Satesh; Macpherson, Calum N.

The anti-nucleolar effects were most pronounced in postmitotic neurons. Moreover, in the latter system, nucleolar presence of ZIKV capsid protein (ZIKV-C) was associated with ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Deletion of 22 C-terminal residues of ZIKV-C prevented nucleolar localization, ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Consistent with a casual relationship between ZIKV-C-induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis, ZIKV-C-overexpressing neurons were protected by loss-of-function manipulations targeting the ribosomal stress effector Tp53 or knockdown of the ribosomal stress mediator RPL11. Finally, capsid protein of Dengue virus, but not West Nile virus, induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Thus, anti-nucleolar and pro-apoptotic effects of protein C are flavivirus-species specific.

Visible actions representing typical flu-like symptoms include sneeze and cough that are associated with changing patterns of hand to head distances, among others. The technical difficulties lie in the high complexity and large variation of those actions as well as numerous similar background actions such as scratching head, cell phone use, eating, drinking and so on. RESULTS: In this paper, we make a first attempt at the challenging problem of recognizing flu-like symptoms from videos. Since there was no related dataset available, we created a new public health dataset for action recognition that includes two major flu-like symptom related actions (sneeze and cough) and a number of background actions. We also developed a suitable novel algorithm by introducing two types of Action Matching Kernels, where both types aim to integrate two aspects of local features, namely the space-time layout and the Bag-of-Words representations. In particular, we show that the Pyramid Match Kernel and Spatial Pyramid Matching are both special cases of our proposed kernels. Besides experimenting on standard testbed, the proposed algorithm is evaluated also on the new sneeze and cough set. Empirically, we observe that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-arts, while recognition on the new public health dataset is shown to be a non-trivial task even with simple single person unobstructed view. CONCLUSIONS: Our sneeze and cough video dataset and newly developed action recognition algorithm is the first of its kind and aims to kick-start the field of action recognition of flu-like symptoms from videos. It will be challenging but necessary in future developments to consider more complex real-life scenario of detecting these actions simultaneously from multiple persons in possibly crowded environments.","publish_time":"2014-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thi, Tuan Hue; Wang, Li; Ye, Ning; Zhang, Jian; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Cheng, Li","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a286d1120f3b36b22f1b9e4e6409cad9b8471370.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4180141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217118/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Action Matching Kernels"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Visible actions","new sneeze","number of background actions","field of action recognition of flu","developed action recognition algorithm","cough video dataset","symptom related actions","symptoms","new public health dataset","numerous similar background actions","major flu","typical flu","types of Action Matching Kernels","cough set","proposed algorithm","related dataset available","challenging problem of recognizing flu","proposed kernels","videos","Spatial Pyramid Matching","suitable novel algorithm","scratching head","head distances","Pyramid Match Kernel","Vision-based surveillance","early detection of respiratory disease outbreaks","molecular diagnostics","urban areas","hospital","potential alternative","doctor visit","monitoring","special cases","simple single person unobstructed view","high complexity","non-trivial task","changing patterns of hand","complex real-life scenario","future developments","cell phone use","Bag","space-time layout","attempt","multiple persons","large variation","standard testbed","aspects of local features","alert systems","competitive performance","state","crowded environments","technical difficulties","experimenting","arts","CONCLUSIONS","paper","Words representations","approach","kind","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although based on a relatively simple principle, its complex interaction with the cardiovascular system remains challenging and open to debate. The aim of this work was focused on the development of a new numerical model of IABP. Methods : The new module was implemented in CARDIOSIM\u00A9, which is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research and e-learning environment. The IABP is inserted into the systemic bed divided in aortic, thoracic and two abdominal tracts modelled with resistances inertances and compliances. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances connected to PIABP generator and resistances. PIABP generator reproduces the balloon pressure with the option to change IABP timing.We have used literature data to validate the potential of this new numerical model. Results : The results have shown that our simulation reproduced the typical effects induced during IABP assistance. We have also simulated the effects induced by the device on the hemodynamic variables when the IABP ratio was set to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. The outcome of these simulations is in accordance with literature data measured in the clinical environment. Conclusions : The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting. Although based on literature data, the outcome of the simulations is encouraging. Additional work is ongoing with a view to further validate its features. The configuration of CARDIOSIM\u00A9 presented in this work allows to simulate the effects induced by mechanical ventilatory assistance. This facility may have significant importance in the management of patients affected by COVID-19 when they require mechanical circulatory support devices.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Lazzari, Claudio; De Lazzari, Beatrice; Iacovoni, Attilio; Marconi, Silvia; Papa, Silvia; Capoccia, Massimo; Badagliacca, Roberto; Vizza, Carmine Dario","journal":"Computer methods and programs in biomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98d009462275e88cac36390c31ff4ca45dbb4eac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260720308257?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260720308257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IABP","PIABP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IABP assistance","new IABP module","IABP timing","IABP ratio","new numerical model of IABP","literature data","new module","short-term mechanical circulatory support","mechanical circulatory support devices","cardiovascular system","available device","balloon pressure","PIABP generator","mechanical ventilatory assistance","typical effects","clinical environment","simulations","Additional work","outcome","Results","intra-aortic balloon pump","presence of compliances","left ventricular assist device","resistances inertances","clinical setting","configuration of CARDIOSIM","extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support","e-learning environment","bridge","Objective","complex interaction","abdominal tracts","research","potential","modular software simulator","significant importance","management of patients","view","systemic bed","hemodynamic variables","option","accordance","development","cardiopulmonary bypass","Abstract Background","simple principle","training tool","aorta","debate","COVID","Conclusions","facility","Methods","features","aim"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients\u2019 demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Rong; Zhang, Yuan; Huang, Lei; Cheng, Bi-heng; Xia, Zhong-yuan; Meng, Qing-tao","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0708f87b05b0f71043ea2e4f9464ea7616200baa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090434.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32180175/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["general anesthesia","standardized anesthesia","COVID","continuous epidural anesthesia","Cesarean delivery","neonatal SARS-CoV","involved medical staff","medical staff access procedures","surgery procedures","standardized procedures","safety of epidural","cases of parturients","clinical characteristics","coronavirus disease","emergency surgery","neonatal complications","non-pregnant adult patients","surgery-related data","nucleic acid tests","nucleic acid positivity","pregnant women","serious neonatal asphyxia events","infection disease","incidence of hypotension","Proper patient transfer","significant intraoperative hypotension","patient care period","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","chest computed tomography scans","laboratory measurements","effective biosafety precautions","tracheal intubation","epidemiologic history","health status","deaths","management","patients\u2019 demographic","CONCLUSIONS","hospital treatment","RESULTS","newborns","METHODS","PURPOSE","neonates"],"language":"en"},

We studied 57 MS patients and 59 controls with similar age and sex distributions. In MS patients, we found the classical increased frequency of HLA-DR2, HLA-DQw1 and also an excess of Gm (3; \u00B123; 5*). Mumps antibody levels were higher in MS patients than in controls; elevation was not significant for measles antibodies. Analysis suggests that an association between HLA-DQwl and antibody titers against various viruses exists in controls but is absent in MS patients. In particular, we found that mumps antibody titers were higher in DQwl-positive than in DQwl-negative controls, while there was no significant difference among MS cases. Accordingly, we found that the overall difference between patients and controls was due to the fact that DQwl-positive patients had higher titers than controls, while DQwl-negative cases had similar titers as controls. These findings suggest that biological and molecular characteristics of DQwl might differ in MS patients.","publish_time":"1991-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alp\u00E9rovitch, A.; Berr, C.; Cambon-Thomsen, A.; Puel, J.; Dugoujon, J.-M.; Ruidavets, J.-B.; Clanet, M.","journal":"Human Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a845c20d2ca640c7c19e88adfb96205f7d9ba361.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019888599190011W; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/019888599190011W","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gm"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS patients","HLA-DQwl","DQwl-negative controls","DQwl-positive patients","MS cases","higher titers","mumps antibody titers","similar titers","DQwl-negative cases","molecular characteristics of DQwl","Mumps antibody levels","HLA-class","HLA-DQw1","significant difference","classical increased frequency of HLA","various viruses","similar age","excess of Gm","measles antibodies","overall difference","immunoglobulin Gm allotypes","herpes simplex","DR2","elevation","varicella-zoster","cytomegalovirus","antigens","coronavirus","multiple sclerosis","rubella","possible interrelations","sex distributions","association","fact","findings","purpose","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper identifies four common reasons given for the lack of effective canine rabies control in Africa: (a) a low priority given for disease control as a result of lack of awareness of the rabies burden; (b) epidemiological constraints such as uncertainties about the required levels of vaccination coverage and the possibility of sustained cycles of infection in wildlife; (c) operational constraints including accessibility of dogs for vaccination and insufficient knowledge of dog population sizes for planning of vaccination campaigns; and (d) limited resources for implementation of rabies surveillance and control. We address each of these issues in turn, presenting data from field studies and modelling approaches used in Tanzania, including burden of disease evaluations, detailed epidemiological studies, operational data from vaccination campaigns in different demographic and ecological settings, and economic analyses of the cost-effectiveness of dog vaccination for human rabies prevention. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that there are no insurmountable problems to canine rabies control in most of Africa; that elimination of canine rabies is epidemiologically and practically feasible through mass vaccination of domestic dogs; and that domestic dog vaccination provides a cost-effective approach to the prevention and elimination of human rabies deaths.","publish_time":"2010-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lembo, Tiziana; Hampson, Katie; Kaare, Magai T.; Ernest, Eblate; Knobel, Darryn; Kazwala, Rudovick R.; Haydon, Daniel T.; Cleaveland, Sarah","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5dd178e6cfe607d118df9d16716cd68605dbee4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2826407.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20186330/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["rabies burden","elimination of canine rabies","human rabies prevention","domestic dog vaccination","lack of effective canine rabies control","elimination of human rabies deaths","cost-effectiveness of dog vaccination","planning of vaccination campaigns","implementation of rabies surveillance","mass vaccination of domestic dogs","disease control","Africa","required levels of vaccination coverage","operational data","operational constraints","epidemiological constraints","thousands of human deaths","detailed epidemiological studies","burden of disease evaluations","field studies","accessibility of dogs","result of lack","insufficient knowledge of dog population sizes","different demographic","ecological settings","wildlife","economic analyses","Tanzania","uncertainties","cost-effective approach","possibility of sustained cycles of infection","modelling approaches","limited resources","paper","common reasons","turn","year","awareness","insurmountable problems","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","low priority","METHODOLOGY","BACKGROUND","issues","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","continent"],"language":"en"},

However, it is incompletely understood how IFITM1\u20133 exert antiviral activity. Two phenylalanine residues, F75 and F78, within the intramembrane domain 1 (IM1) were previously shown to be required for IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions and for inhibition of viral entry, suggesting that IFITM/IFITM interactions might be pivotal to antiviral activity. Here, we employed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay to analyze IFITM/IFITM interactions. For assay calibration, we equipped two cytosolic, non-interacting proteins, super yellow fluorescent protein (SYFP) and super cyan fluorescent protein (SCFP), with signals that target proteins to membrane rafts and also analyzed a SCFP-SYFP fusion protein. This strategy allowed us to discriminate background signals resulting from colocalization of proteins at membrane subdomains from signals elicited by protein\u2013protein interactions. Coexpression of IFITM1\u20133 and IFITM5 fused to fluorescent proteins elicited strong FRET signals, and mutation of F75 and F78 in IFITM3 (mutant IFITM3-FF) abrogated antiviral activity, as expected, but did not alter cellular localization and FRET signals. Moreover, IFITM3-FF co-immunoprecipitated efficiently with wild type (wt) IFITM3, lending further support to the finding that lack of antiviral activity of IFITM3-FF was not due to altered membrane targeting or abrogated IFITM3-IFITM3 interactions. Collectively, we report an assay that allows quantifying IFITM/IFITM interactions. Moreover, we confirm residues F75 and F78 as critical for antiviral activity but also show that these residues are dispensable for IFITM3 membrane localization and IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions.","publish_time":"2019-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Winkler, Michael; Wrensch, Florian; Bosch, Pascale; Knoth, Maike; Schindler, Michael; G\u00E4rtner, Sabine; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39cf63270ea4247abd489125c9d3c78d8f400987.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6719045.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20163859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["abrogated IFITM3-IFITM3 interactions","IFITM interactions","IFITM3 membrane localization","protein interactions","lack of antiviral activity of IFITM3","mutant IFITM3-FF","IFITM3-FF co-immunoprecipitated","fluorescent proteins","quantifying IFITM","strong FRET signals","F78","colocalization of proteins","background signals","transmembrane proteins","residues F75","super yellow fluorescent protein","super cyan fluorescent protein","membrane subdomains","membrane rafts","altered membrane","SCFP-SYFP fusion protein","non-interacting proteins","mutation of F75","assay calibration","phenylalanine residues","Coexpression of IFITM1","cellular localization","inhibition of viral entry","host cell entry","wild type","wt","IFITM5","fluorescence resonance energy transfer","support","finding","intramembrane domain","viruses","IM1","interferon","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Three groups of 6- to 7-month-old feedlot calves from New Mexico (NM) (n=103), Arkansas (AR) (n=100) and Ohio (OH) (n=140) and a group of 7- to 10-day-old Ohio veal calves (n=47) were studied.

Virus-like particles of Bo/CV186-OH/00/US and Bo/NB/80/US were expressed using the baculovirus expression system and were used in ELISA to measure antibodies. A high seroprevalence of 94-100 % and 78-100 % was observed for antibodies to GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus, respectively, in the feedlot calves tested.

This study seeks to explore whether this epidemic has altered the willingness of Hong Kong medical students to perform basic life support and mouth-to-mouth ventilation during an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods A questionnaire was used to survey Year 4 medical students at the end of their undergraduate anaesthesia attachment, during which basic life support (BLS) skills were taught. The survey was conducted during July and August 2003, approximately two months after Hong Kong was removed from the World Health Organisation SARS Infected Areas list, and was designed to examine student confidence in BLS skills, their perceptions of the risks associated with performing BLS and their willingness to perform BLS in varying situations. Results The response rate was over 60% (35 from a possible 54). Students were positive regarding the adequacy of their BLS training. They were concerned about disease transmission during resuscitation but were less positive regarding whether the risks had increased due to SARS. In all situations they were significantly more likely to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation for a family member compared with a stranger (p \u003C0.001) and to withhold mouth-to-mouth ventilation if either vomit or blood were present in the victim\u0027s mouth. Conclusions Hong Kong medical students feel able to perform BLS if required. They are concerned about the risk of disease transmission, including SARS, during resuscitation, but would be more likely to withhold mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in the presence of vomit or blood than due to a fear of contracting SARS.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caves, N.

MHV is a collection of strains, which provide models systems for the study of viral tropism and pathogenesis in several organs systems, including the central nervous system, the liver, and the lung, and has been cited as providing one of the few animal models for the study of chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. SARS-CoV emerged in the human population in China in 2002, causing a worldwide epidemic with severe morbidity and high mortality rates, particularly in older individuals. We review the pathogenesis of both viruses and the several reverse genetics systems that made much of these studies possible. We also review the functions of coronavirus proteins, structural, enzymatic, and accessory, with an emphasis on roles in pathogenesis. Structural proteins in addition to their roles in virion structure and morphogenesis also contribute significantly to viral spread in vivo and in antagonizing host cell responses. Nonstructural proteins include the small accessory proteins that are not at all conserved between MHV and SARS-CoV and the 16 conserved proteins encoded in the replicase locus, many of which have enzymatic activities in RNA metabolism or protein processing in addition to functions in antagonizing host response.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weiss, Susan R.; Leibowitz, Julian L.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6be4fe1605ea1a6f558204da253019a399be3178.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149603.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-385885-6.00009-2; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123858856000092; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123858856000092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22094080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["conserved proteins","functions of coronavirus proteins","MHV","Nonstructural proteins","SARS-CoV","review","small accessory proteins","models systems","addition","severe acute respiratory coronavirus","organs systems","chronic diseases","roles","pathogenesis of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","study of chronic demyelinating diseases","study of viral tropism","antagonizing host response","reverse genetics systems","severe morbidity","enzymatic activities","antagonizing host cell responses","animal models","protein processing","high mortality rates","RNA metabolism","worldwide epidemic","morphogenesis","humans","central nervous system","species of animals","liver","multiple sclerosis","virion structure","older individuals","human population","collection of strains","replicase locus","Abstract Coronaviruses","China","emphasis","studies possible","lung"],"language":"en"},

In the field of aesthetic surgery, the self-imposed moratorium for all aesthetic surgery procedures recommended by most international scientific societies has been adopted by many surgeons worldwide and resulted in a huge socioeconomic impact for most private practices and clinics. An important question still unanswered in most countries is when and how should elective/aesthetic procedures be scheduled again and what kind of organizational changes are necessary to protect patients and healthcare workers when clinics and practices reopen. Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures. METHODS We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed research for all available publications on COVID-19 and surgery and COVID-19 and anesthesia. Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19-positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery. Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management. Current recommendations and published protocols on contamination control, avoidance of cross-contamination and procedural patient flow are reviewed. A COVID-19 testing guideline protocol for patients planning to undergo elective aesthetic surgery is presented and recommendations are made regarding adaptation of current patient information/informed consent forms and patient health questionnaires. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 crisis has led to unprecedented challenges in the acute management of the crisis, and the wave only recently seems to flatten out in some countries. The adaptation of surgical and procedural steps for a risk-minimizing management of potential COVID-19-positive patients seeking to undergo elective aesthetic procedures in the wake of that wave will present the next big challenge for the aesthetic surgery community. We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients. New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed. We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare the elective surgical specialties better for a possible second wave of the pandemic.

Ideally, samples from the lower respiratory tract are collected, but they are difficult to obtain. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we compared the diagnostic yield in sputum and oropharyngeal samples (OPS) for the detection of respiratory pathogens in patients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP), with the objective to optimize our diagnostic testing algorithm. METHODS: Matched sputum samples, OPS, blood cultures, serum, and urine samples were taken from patients (\u003E18 years) with CAP and tested for the presence of possible respiratory pathogens using bacterial cultures, PCR for 17 viruses and five bacteria and urinary antigen testing. RESULTS: When using only conventional methods, that is, blood cultures, sputum culture, urinary antigen tests, a pathogen was detected in 49\u00B76% of patients (n = 57). Adding molecular detection assays increased the yield to 80%. A pathogen was detected in 77 of the 115 patients in OPS or sputum samples by PCR. The sensitivity of the OPS was lower than that of the sputum samples (57% versus 74%). In particular, bacterial pathogens were more often detected in sputum samples. The sensitivity of OPS for the detection of most viruses was higher than in sputum samples (72% versus 66%), except for human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSION: Addition of PCR on both OPS and sputum samples significantly increased the diagnostic yield. For molecular detection of bacterial pathogens, a sputum sample is imperative, but for detection of most viral pathogens, an OPS is sufficient.","publish_time":"2013-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huijskens, Elisabeth G.

Previous studies suggested a close association between the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genetic variant rs12252 and influenza. Here, we explored the correlation between the rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity using meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant studies published before May 22, 2014 were retrieved from PubMed, ISI web of knowledge, EBSCO, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials databases. Association between rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity were determined using statistical analysis of odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of four studies consisting of 445 cases and 4180 controls were included in our analysis. Generally, there is increased risk of influenza in subjects carrying rs12252 in the recessive model (CC vs. CT\u002BTT: OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.49-3.70, P\u003C0.001), the dominant model (CC\u002BCT vs. TT: OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.18\u20132.22, P=0.003), the homozygote comparison (CC vs. TT: OR=4.11, 95% CI: 2.15\u20137.84, P\u003C0.001), and the allele contrast (C vs. T: OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.32\u20132.13, P\u003C0.001). Stratification analysis of ethnicity and severity revealed a significant increase in influenza susceptibility by IFITM3-SNP rs12252 among both Asian and Caucasian population. SNP rs12252 shows significant impact on severe infections (P\u003C0.05), but not on mild influenza. Besides, our result also associated rs12252 with influenza severity (severe vs. mild: OR=2.37, 95% CI: 1.32\u20134.25, P=0.004), (severe vs. control: OR=2.70, 95% CI: 1.85\u20133.94, P\u003C0.001). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests a significant association between a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) with severe influenza susceptibility, but not in mild influenza subjects, in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese population. The rs12252-C allele causes a 23.7% higher chance of infection and also constitutes a risk factor for more severe influenza.","publish_time":"2015-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xianxian; Tan, Bin; Zhou, Xipeng; Xue, Jian; Zhang, Xian; Wang, Peng; Shao, Chuang; Li, Yingli; Li, Chaorui; Xia, Huiming; Qiu, Jingfu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/396312dfae0562afce275a99e96c903e91aa96c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4420464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25942469/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0124985","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISI","CC CT","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza severity","severe influenza susceptibility","avian influenza","pandemic influenza","mild influenza subjects","increased risk of influenza","IFITM3-SNP rs12252","SNP rs12252-C","rs12252-C allele","genetic variant rs12252","severe morbidity","severe infections","meta-analysis","significant association","CC","TT","minor IFITM3 allele","Stratification analysis of ethnicity","significant increase","significant impact","pdm09 virus","close association","allele contrast","statistical analysis of odds ratios","Previous studies","Relevant studies","recessive model","dominant model","risk factor","Caucasian population","Han Chinese population","UK Caucasians","EBSCO","Cochrane central register of controlled trials databases","H1N1","ISI web of knowledge","H7N9","H5N1","interferon","ORs","transmembrane protein","mortality","higher chance of infection","homozygote comparison","PubMed","world","correlation","METHODS","RESULTS","total","cases","controls","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Each virion consists of three major subviral components, namely (i) a viral envelope decorated with three transmembrane proteins hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and M2, (ii) an intermediate layer of matrix protein (M1), and (iii) an innermost helical viral ribonucleocapsid [vRNP] core formed by nucleoprotein (NP) and negative strand viral RNA (vRNA). Since complete virus particles are not found inside the cell, the processes of assembly, morphogenesis, budding and release of progeny virus particles at the plasma membrane of the infected cells are critically important for the production of infectious virions and pathogenesis of influenza viruses as well. Morphogenesis and budding require that all virus components must be brought to the budding site which is the apical plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells whether in vitro cultured cells or in vivo infected animals. HA and NA forming the outer spikes on the viral envelope possess apical sorting signals and use exocytic pathways and lipid rafts for cell surface transport and apical sorting. NP also has apical determinant(s) and is probably transported to the apical budding site similarly via lipid rafts and/or through cortical actin microfilaments. M1 binds the NP and the exposed RNAs of vRNPs, as well as to the cytoplasmic tails (CT) and transmembrane (TM) domains of HA, NA and M2, and is likely brought to the budding site on the piggy-back of vRNP and transmembrane proteins. Budding processes involve bud initiation, bud growth and bud release. Presence of lipid rafts and assembly of viral components at the budding site can cause asymmetry of lipid bilayers and outward membrane bending leading to bud initiation and bud growth. Bud release requires fusion of the apposing viral and cellular membranes and scission of the virus buds from the infected cellular membrane. The processes involved in bud initiation, bud growth and bud scission/release require involvement both viral and host components and can affect bud closing and virus release in both positive and negative ways. Among the viral components, M1, M2 and NA play important roles in bud release and M1, M2 and NA mutations all affect the morphology of buds and released viruses. Disassembly of host cortical actin microfilaments at the pinching-off site appears to facilitate bud fission and release. Bud scission is energy dependent and only a small fraction of virus buds present on the cell surface is released. Discontinuity of M1 layer underneath the lipid bilayer, absence of outer membrane spikes, absence of lipid rafts in the lipid bilayer, as well as possible presence of M2 and disassembly of cortical actin microfilaments at the pinching off site appear to facilitate bud fission and bud release. We provide our current understanding of these important processes leading to the production of infectious influenza virus particles.","publish_time":"2009-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nayak, Debi P.; Balogun, Rilwan A.; Yamada, Hiroshi; Zhou, Z.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1\u20137), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease. The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"South, Andrew M.; Diz, Debra I.; Chappell, Mark C.","journal":"Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191628.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00217.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang"],"organizations":["SARS","Recognition","ANG II","ANG","RAAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 blockade","express ACE2","ACE2 regulation","cardiovascular benefits of ACE2","RAAS blockers","novel SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV","potential consequences of RAAS blockade","statins","infection","effects of ANG","older patients","enzyme","underlying cardiovascular disease","renin-angiotensin","receptor antagonists","mineralocorticoid antagonists","attenuate COVID","experimental evidence","new clinical concerns","new therapeutic approaches","chronic respiratory disease","membrane-bound form of angiotensin","lung","type","ACE inhibitors","related pathologies","kidney","heart","CVDs","peptide","viable approach","aldosterone system","tissues","pandemic","brain","hypertension","key enzymatic component","requisite binding","complex","internalization","cellular entry","coreceptor","greater risk","multiple actions","expression","fact","statin therapy","host cell","current perspective","gut","Recognition","mechanism","regimens"],"language":"en"},

Pregnant sows experimentally inoculated with Virus X (ISUYP604671) or homogenate (filtrate) of tissues from a clinically affected animal developed clinical signs and pathological changes similar to field observations including the loss of pregnancy. Furthermore, caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived young pigs developed mild encephalomyelitis lesions in brains after experimental inoculation with the virus or the tissue homogenate although clinical neurologic signs were not observed. More importantly, Virus X was re-isolated from all inoculated animals while control pigs remained negative for the virus during the study.

Moreover, the ER stress sensor inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), but not its substrate X-box protein 1 (XBP1), was also essential for the induction of autophagy during IBV infection. Finally, the anti-apoptotic extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) also contributed to IBV-induced autophagy.

In this article, we address the important issue of recombinant protein degradation in plant expression platforms, which directly impacts on the final yield, homogeneity and overall quality of the resulting protein product. Unlike several more stable and structurally less complex pharmaceuticals, recombinant proteins present a natural tendency to structural heterogeneity, resulting in part from the inherent instability of polypeptide chains expressed in heterologous environments. Proteolytic processing, notably, may dramatically alter the structural integrity and overall accumulation of recombinant proteins in plant expression systems, both in planta during expression and ex planta after extraction.

Methods We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons\u2019 opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before any hospital admission for cardiac surgery, nasopharyngeal swab, r-PCR and chest CT should be performed; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patient\u2019s COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on a rapidly convened multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery during the pandemic was controversial. Conclusions In this unprecedented pandemic period, this survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benedetto, Umberto; Goodwin, Andrew; Kendall, Simon; Uppal, Rakesh; Akowuah, Enoch","journal":"The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.05.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522320311673; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022522320311673?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","PPE"],"locations":["Great Britain","Ireland"],"keyphrases":["cardiac surgery","Cardiothoracic Surgery","mitral surgery","heart surgery","survey","consultant cardiac surgeons","cardiac procedure","UK cardiac units","patients","UK surgeons\u2019 opinion","clinical decision","clinical observations","interim recommendations","consultant surgeons","risk of COVID","Strong consensus","role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery","data","information","firm recommendations","nationwide UK consultants\u2019 opinion","unprecedented pandemic period","theatre team regardless patient\u2019s COVID","Systematic appraisal of senior surgeons\u2019 consensus","web-based questionnaire","convened multidisciplinary team discussion","Ireland","nasopharyngeal swab","Society","Great Britain","r-PCR","SCTS","status","hospital admission","exposure","mailing list","chest CT","Abstract Background","following key questions","Conclusions","items","selected cases","mortality","majority","Methods","total","use","PPE"],"language":"en"},

These patients travelled with a group of 29 other Dutch travellers. We conducted an epidemiological assessment of the travel group to identify likely source(s) of infection and presence of potential risk factors. METHODS: All travellers, including the two cases, completed a questionnaire focussing on potential human, animal and food exposures to MERS-CoV. The questionnaire was modified from the WHO MERS-CoV questionnaire, taking into account the specific route and activities of the travel group. RESULTS: Twelve non-cases drank unpasteurized camel milk and had contact with camels. Most travellers, including one of the two patients (Case 1), visited local markets, where six of them consumed fruits. Two travellers, including Case 1, were exposed to coughing patients when visiting a hospital in Medina. Four travellers, including Case 1, visited two hospitals in Mecca. All travellers had been in contact with Case 1 while he was sick, with initially non-respiratory complaints. The cases were found to be older than the other travellers and both had co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiological study revealed the complexity of MERS-CoV outbreak investigations with multiple potential exposures to MERS-CoV reported such as healthcare visits, camel exposure, and exposure to untreated food products. Exposure to MERS-CoV during a hospital visit is considered a likely source of infection for Case 1 but not for Case 2. For Case 2, the most likely source could not be determined. Exposure to MERS-CoV via direct contact with animals or dairy products seems unlikely for the two Dutch cases. Furthermore, exposure to a common but still unidentified source cannot be ruled out. More comprehensive research into sources of infection in the Arabian Peninsula is needed to strengthen and specify the prevention of MERS-CoV infections.","publish_time":"2014-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fanoy, Ewout B; van der Sande, Marianne AB; Kraaij-Dirkzwager, Marleen; Dirksen, Kees; Jonges, Marcel; van der Hoek, Wim; Koopmans, Marion PG; van der Werf, Douwe; Sonder, Gerard; van der Weijden, Charlie; van der Heuvel, Jet; Gelinck, Luc; Bouwhuis, Jolande W; van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B","journal":"Emerg Themes Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c0e91904a6c84a7ee80cc69fe83370aaa3ca708.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4200475.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-7622-11-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25328533/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Mecca","Medina"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV questionnaire","Dutch travellers","complexity of MERS","prevention of MERS","CoV infections","likely source of infection","camel exposure","Dutch cases","CoV outbreak investigations","non-cases","patients","sources of infection","travel group","unidentified source","multiple potential exposures","food exposures","potential human","direct contact","Mecca","Medina","Dutch residents","untreated food products","non-respiratory complaints","presence of potential risk factors","dairy products","hospital visit","epidemiological study","epidemiological assessment","unpasteurized camel milk","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","animals","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","specific route","activities","pilgrimage","account","healthcare visits","KSA","comprehensive research","Arabian Peninsula","RESULTS","viral genomes","CONCLUSIONS","camels","co-morbidities","local markets","hospitals","BACKGROUND","METHODS","fruits"],"language":"en"},

The effects on cellular aging processes are incompletely understood. METHODS: Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by qPCR in this longitudinal cohort study with blood samples taken at birth and at 2 years of age from 60 children (16 preterm and 44 term). Viral respiratory infections the first year were evaluated. Epigenetic biological DNA methylation (DNAm) age was predicted based on methylation array data in 23 children (11 preterm and 12 term). RTL change/year and DNAm age change/year was compared in preterm and term during the 2 first years of life. RESULTS: Preterm infants had longer telomeres than term born at birth and at 2 years of age, but no difference in telomere attrition rate could be detected. Predicted epigenetic DNAm age was younger in preterm infants, but rate of DNAm aging was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite early exposure to risk factors for accelerated cellular aging, children born preterm exhibited preserved telomeres. Stress during the neonatal intensive care period did not reflect accelerated epigenetic DNAm aging. Early-life aging was not explained by preterm birth. IMPACT: Preterm birth is associated with elevated disease risk later in life. Preterm children often suffer from inflammation early in life. Stress-related telomere erosion during neonatal intensive care has been proposed. Inflammation-accelerated biological aging in preterm is unknown. We find no accelerated aging due to prematurity or infections during the first 2 years of life.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henckel, Ewa; Landfors, Mattias; Haider, Zahra; Kosma, Paraskevi; Hultdin, Magnus; Degerman, Sofie; Bohlin, Kajsa","journal":"Pediatr Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7505f3e3ff9dabd65276932b8694bb374d33d8c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086539.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32170191/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-0833-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Preterm children","preterm birth","life aging","Preterm infants","accelerated aging","years of life","accelerated epigenetic DNAm aging","rate of DNAm aging","biological aging","years of age","epigenetic DNAm age","accelerated cellular aging","DNAm age change","cellular aging processes","preterm exhibited preserved telomeres","neonatal intensive care period","early exposure","neonatal intensive care triggers inflammatory processes","oxidative stress","risk factors","Stress-related telomere erosion","RTL change","elevated disease risk","Epigenetic biological DNA methylation","telomere attrition rate","Prematurity","inflammation","Relative telomere length","methylation array data","Viral respiratory infections","longitudinal cohort study","blood samples","difference","qPCR","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","effects","groups","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","IMPACT"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at providing preliminary estimates of influenza and other respiratory infections circulating among adults in Qatar. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of about 44,000 patients who visited Hamad General Hospital clinics, sentinel sites, and all primary healthcare centers in Qatar between 2012 and 2017. All samples were tested for influenza viruses, whereas about 38,000 samples were tested for influenza and a panel of respiratory viruses using Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) RT-PCR kit. RESULTS: Among all ILIs cases, 20,278 (46.5%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Influenza virus was predominating (22.6%), followed by human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (9.5%), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) (5%). A detection rate of 2\u20133% was recorded for mycoplasma pneumonia, adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). ILIs cases were reported throughout the year, however, influenza, RSV, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal peaks in the winter, while HRVs circulated more during fall and spring. Elderly (\u003E50 years) had the lowest rates of influenza A (13.9%) and B (4.2%), while presenting the highest rates of RSV (3.4%) and HMPV (3.3%). While males had higher rates of HRVs (11.9%), enteroviruses (1.1%) and MERS CoV (0.2%), females had higher proportions of influenza (26.3%), HPIVs (3.2%) and RSV (3.6%) infections. CONCLUSION: This report provides a comprehensive insight about the epidemiology of ILIs among adults in the Qatar, as a representative of Gulf States.

Pigs were intranasally inoculated with the European PRRSV strain, Lelystad virus ter Huurne, and were vaccinated intramuscularly with PRV 2 weeks later (LV-PRV group). Control pigs were vaccinated with PRV only (PRV group). Eight weeks after PRV vaccination, pigs from both groups were challenged intranasally with wild-type PRV. We measured the lymphoproliferative, and the cytolytic responses to PRV of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), isolated from blood samples. In addition, serum samples were examined for antibodies against PRV and LV. One week after PRV vaccination, PBMC proliferated abundantly to PRV in both groups. However, in the LV-PRV group the lymphoproliferative response declined after 1 week, whereas, in the PRV group, the lymphoproliferative response was high for 3 weeks and declined thereafter (P\u003C0.05). After challenge, the lymphoproliferative response was 1 week earlier and was consistently and significantly higher in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group. The PRV-specific killing was higher at 3 weeks after PRV vaccination and 5 weeks after PRV challenge 19\u00B13 and 24\u00B16%, respectively, in the PRV group, compared to 7\u00B14 and 6\u00B19%, respectively, in the LV-PRV group (P\u003C0.05). However, later after vaccination and challenge the cytolytic response was identical in both groups. The antibody titre against PRV developed equally in both groups. After challenge, no PRV virus was isolated from both groups. From these results we conclude that, although PRRSV infection did cause changes in the time course of the T-lymphocyte response after PRV vaccination, PRRSV infection did not inhibit the development of vaccine-induced protection after PRV.","publish_time":"2000-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Bruin, M.G.M; Samsom, J.

Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been found to be effective against several DNA viruses, such as Herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus. Recently, we and others have reported the inhibitory effect of LiCl on avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) infection, an RNA virus. In the current study, the action mechanism of LiCl on cell infection by TGEV was investigated. Plaque assays and 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assays showed that the cell infection by TGEV was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, when LiCl was added to virus-infected cells; the cell infection was not affected when either cells or viruses were pretreated with the drug. The inhibition of TGEV infection in vitro by LiCl was observed at different virus doses and with different cell lines. The inhibitory effect of LiCl against TGEV infection and transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR targeting viral S and 3CL-protease genes. The time-of-addition effect of the drug on TGEV infection indicated that LiCl acted on the initial and late stage of TGEV infection. The production of virus was not detected at 36 h post-infection due to the drug treatment. Moreover, immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry analyses based on staining of Annexin V and propidium iodide staining of nuclei indicated that early and late cell apoptosis induced by TGEV was inhibited efficiently. The ability of LiCl to inhibit apoptosis was investigated by IF analysis of caspase-3 expression. Our data indicate that LiCl inhibits TGEV infection by exerting an anti-apoptotic effect. The inhibitory effect of LiCl was also observed with porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus. Together with other reports concerning the inhibitory effect of lithium salts on IBV in cell culture, our results indicate that LiCl may be a potent agent against porcine and avian coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2011-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Xiaofeng; Meng, Fandan; Yin, Jiechao; Li, Guangxing; Li, Xunliang; Wang, Chao; Herrler, Georg","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82448eac471a17fd751603f9b91450b6961d3a0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3089605.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21573100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell infection","inhibitory effect of LiCl","inhibition of TGEV infection","ability of LiCl","late stage of TGEV infection","action mechanism of LiCl","h post-infection","vaccinia virus","RNA virus","production of virus","cell culture","addition effect","late cell apoptosis","different virus doses","virus-infected cells","inhibitory effect of lithium salts","different cell lines","Herpes simplex virus","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","porcine coronavirus","anti-apoptotic effect","IBV","porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus","drug treatment","avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus","real-time PCR","RT-PCR","avian coronaviruses","DNA viruses","Lithium chloride","Plaque assays","staining of Annexin V","propidium iodide staining of nuclei","viral S","potent agent","flow cytometry analyses","transcription","MTT","results","current study","dose-dependent manner","phenyl tetrazoliumbromide","reports","data","protease genes","analysis of caspase","dimethylthiahiazo","z-y1","expression","immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

However, such surveys among the French general population are rare. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006 in a representative sample of 600 subjects living in the Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes region (south-east France) to investigate self-reported knowledge about infectious diseases and anxiety generated by epidemic risk with particular reference to avian influenza. Data on reactions to potentially new epidemics and the confidence level in various sources of information were also collected. RESULTS: Respondents were most knowledgeable about AIDS, followed by avian influenza. Overall, 75% of respondents had adequate knowledge of avian influenza. The percentage was even higher (88%) among inhabitants of the Ain district, where an avian influenza epidemic had previously been reported. However, 39% expressed anxiety about this disease. In total, 20% of respondents with knowledge about avian influenza stated that they had changed their behaviours during the epizooty. Epidemics were perceived as a real threat by 27% of respondents. In the event of a highly contagious outbreak, the majority of respondents said they would follow the advice given by authorities. The study population expressed a high level of confidence in physicians and scientists, but had strong reservations about politicians, deputies and the media. CONCLUSIONS: Although the survey was conducted only four months after the avian influenza outbreak, epidemics were not perceived as a major threat by the study population. The results showed that in the event of a highly infectious disease, the population would comply with advice given by public authorities.","publish_time":"2010-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saadatian-Elahi, Mitra; Facy, Fran\u00E7oise; Del Signore, Corinne; Vanhems, Philippe","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0469d052ac583aa5b739be7fedecec5307548d49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2874530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20385030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["avian influenza epidemic","avian influenza outbreak","knowledge of epidemics","adequate knowledge of avian influenza","study population","possible epidemics","new epidemics","majority of respondents","French general population","confidence level","self-reported knowledge","high level of confidence","level of compliance","anxiety","public authorities","cross-sectional study","event","advice","RESULTS","various sources of information","epidemic risk","infectious diseases","communities\u0027 trusted sources of information","contagious outbreak","major threat","real threat","appropriate public health interventions","governments","government measures","south-east France","particular reference","scientists","physicians","consideration","strong reservations","following factors","Ain district","subjects","politicians","deputies","Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes region","fears","months","AIDS","psychological responses","inhabitants","Data","reactions","surveys","representative sample","media","BACKGROUND","METHODS","behaviours","epizooty","percentage","CONCLUSIONS","total"],"language":"en"},

However, a recent study found that one-third of FIPV isolates have an intact 3c and suggested that it is not solely involved in FIP but is essential for intestinal replication. In order to confirm these assumptions, 27 fecal and 32 FIP coronavirus isolates were obtained from resident or adopted cats from a large metropolitan shelter during 2008\u20132009 and their 3a\u2013c, E, and M genes sequenced. Forty percent of coronavirus isolates from FIP tissues had an intact 3c gene, while 60% had mutations that truncated the gene product. The 3c genes of fecal isolates from healthy cats were always intact. Coronavirus from FIP diseased tissues consistently induced FIP when given either oronasally or intraperitoneally (i.p.), regardless of the functional status of their 3c genes, thus confirming them to be FIPVs. In contrast, fecal isolates from healthy cats were infectious following oronasal infection and shed at high levels in feces without causing disease, as expected for FECVs. Only one in three cats shed FECV in the feces following i.p. infection, indicating that FECVs can replicate systemically, but with difficulty. FIPVs having a mutated 3c were not shed in the feces following either oronasal or i.p. inoculation, while FIPVs with intact 3c genes were shed in the feces following oronasal but not i.p. inoculation. Therefore, an intact 3c appears to be essential for intestinal replication. Although FIPVs with an intact 3c were shed in the feces following oronasal inoculation, fecal virus from these cats was not infectious for other cats. Attempts to identify potential FIP mutations in the 3a, 3b, E, and M were negative. However, the 3c gene of FIPVs, even though appearing intact, contained many more non-synonymous amino acid changes in the 3\u2032 one-third of the 3c protein than FECVs. An attempt to trace FIPV isolates back to enteric strains existing in the shelter was only partially successful due to the large region over which shelter cats and kittens originated, housing conditions prior to acquisition, and rapid movement through the shelter. No evidence could be found to support a recent theory that FIPVs and FECVs are genetically distinct.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Niels C.; Liu, Hongwei; Scarlett, Jennifer; Leutenegger, Christian M.; Golovko, Lyudmila; Kennedy, Heather; Kamal, Farina Mustaffa","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee076832e07a1d1bd6afc3c18c1573110a66cb67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114484.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.12.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211005156; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211005156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22280883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["c gene of FIPVs","c genes of fecal isolates","c protein","FIP coronavirus isolates","feces","healthy cats","FIPV isolates","FIP tissues","FECVs","percent of coronavirus isolates","oronasal inoculation","infectious following oronasal infection","potential FIP mutations","fecal virus","FIP diseased tissues","large metropolitan shelter","nonpathogenic feline enteric coronavirus","intestinal replication","gene product","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis virus","enteric strains","large region","recent theory","recent study","housing conditions","high levels","acquisition","kittens","resident","rapid movement","non-synonymous amino acid changes","contrast","assumptions","functional status","attempt","order","evidence","difficulty"],"language":"en"},

Laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases may be asymptomatic, have mild disease, or have a life-threatening infection with a high case fatality rate. There are three patterns of transmission: sporadic community cases from presumed non-human exposure, family clusters arising from contact with an infected family index case, and healthcare-acquired infections among patients and from patients to healthcare workers. Healthcare-acquired MERS infection has become a well-known characteristic of the disease and a leading means of spread. The main factors contributing to healthcare-associated outbreaks include delayed recognition, inadequate infection control measures, inadequate triaging and isolation of suspected MERS or other respiratory illness patients, crowding, and patients remaining in the emergency department for many days. A review of the literature suggests that effective control of hospital outbreaks was accomplished in most instances by the application of proper infection control procedures. Prompt recognition, isolation and management of suspected cases are key factors for prevention of the spread of MERS. Repeated assessments of infection control and monitoring of corrective measures contribute to changing the course of an outbreak. Limiting the number of contacts and hospital visits are also important factors to decrease the spread of infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, J. A.; Auwaerter, P.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of NPA for detecting respiratory viruses in BAL; and to determine the relationship between viruses and lower airway neutrophilia in children with non-acute respiratory illness. STUDY DESIGN: 150 paired NPA and BAL samples were obtained from 75 children aged \u003C18 years undergoing flexible bronchoscopy for investigation of chronic respiratory symptoms. Viral studies were performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cellularity studies were performed on BALs. Diagnostic parameters of NPA compared to BAL and associations between viruses and lower airway %neutrophils were evaluated. RESULTS: NPA had a higher yield than BAL for detection of any respiratory virus (52 versus 38, respectively). NPA had a high sensitivity (92%) and low specificity (57%) for detecting HRV in BAL with poor kappa agreement value of 0.398 (95% CI 0.218\u20130.578, p \u003C 0.001).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Ag/SBA\u201015 materials were prepared by means of incipient wetness impregnation, impregnation and direct hydrothermal synthesis methods. The antimicrobial activity of Ag/SBA\u201015 was investigated using Escherichia coli as an indicator bacterium, and the antimicrobial mechanism was explored. The properties and Ag(\u002B) release behaviour of Ag/SBA\u201015 materials were compared. Experimental results showed that Ag/SBA\u201015 materials resulted in 7\u00B75 log inactivation of E. coli for only 60 min, which exhibited very high antimicrobial activities at room temperature without using any light or electrical power input. The cell wall and cell membrane were destroyed in the antimicrobial process, leading to leakage of intracellular components. The formation of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the bactericidal process was confirmed. Production of intracellular ROS was also discovered. CONCLUSIONS: Ag/SBA\u201015 exhibited high antimicrobial activity against E. coli. This antimicrobial effect was a synergistic action between extracellular ROS and the toxicity of Ag(\u002B), which induced intracellular ROS production and subsequent cell death. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed for the first time the antimicrobial activities and mechanisms of Ag/SBA\u201015 materials prepared with different methods.","publish_time":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, L.; He, H.; Zhang, C.; Sun, L.; Liu, S.; Yue, R.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/703afaa9eb4bd44159f120d022b441171f9e1fd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167009.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.12443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["Ag/SBA","Escherichia"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial activity of Ag","antimicrobial action","antimicrobial process","antimicrobial mechanism","mechanisms of Ag","toxicity of Ag","antimicrobial effect","materials","high antimicrobial activities","exhibited high antimicrobial activity","release behaviour of Ag","mesoporous silica SBA","extracellular ROS","intracellular ROS production","Production of intracellular ROS","cell membrane","cell wall","Escherichia coli","STUDY","different methods","subsequent cell death","leakage of intracellular components","synergistic action","direct hydrothermal synthesis methods","Experimental results","bactericidal process","incipient wetness impregnation","formation of extracellular reactive oxygen species","room temperature","light","indicator bacterium","time","electrical power input","IMPACT","silver","log inactivation of","SIGNIFICANCE","properties","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

As most (re-)emerging viral infections originate from animal sources, it is important to obtain insight into viral pathogens present in the wildlife reservoir from a public health perspective. When monitoring living, free-ranging wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomics platforms allows a more comprehensive inventory of viruses present in wildlife. We report a metagenomic viral survey of the Western Arctic herd of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose swabs of 39 free-ranging caribou was investigated by random amplification combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that applied exhaustive iterative assembly of sequencing results to define taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through homology search methods we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, including different papillomaviruses, a novel parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a virus that potentially represents a member of a novel genus in the family Coronaviridae.","publish_time":"2014-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00FCrch, Anita C.; Schipper, Debby; Bijl, Maarten A.; Dau, Jim; Beckmen, Kimberlee B.; Schapendonk, Claudia M.

We then compared the priority groups to self-reported time spent on surveillance by epidemiologists and ongoing programmes for surveillance through mandatory and/or voluntary notifications and for surveillance of typing results. 106 pathogens were scored. The result of the prioritization process was similar to the outcome of the prioritization in Germany. Common pathogens such as calicivirus and Influenza virus as well as blood-borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, gastro-intestinal infections such as Campylobacter and Salmonella and vector-borne pathogens such as Borrelia were all in the highest priority group. 63% of time spent by epidemiologists on surveillance was spent on pathogens in the highest priority group and all pathogens in the highest priority group, except for Borrelia and varicella-zoster virus, were under surveillance through notifications. Ten pathogens in the highest priority group (Borrelia, calicivirus, Campylobacter, Echinococcus multilocularis, hepatitis C virus, HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS- and MERS coronavirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and varicella-zoster virus) did not have any surveillance of typing results. We will evaluate the possibilities of surveillance for the pathogens in the highest priority group where we currently do not have any ongoing surveillance and evaluate the need of surveillance for the pathogens from the low priority group where there is ongoing surveillance in order to focus our work on the pathogens with the highest relevance.","publish_time":"2015-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dahl, Viktor; Tegnell, Anders; Wallensten, Anders","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/280a11fb6a3cd27873efa93e4600bc4227e7ee0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4580468.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26397699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":["Robert Koch Institute","Borrelia"],"locations":["Sweden","Germany"],"keyphrases":["ongoing surveillance","Common pathogens","highest priority group","need of surveillance","possibilities of surveillance","low priority group","priority groups","surveillance of typing results","Influenza virus","hepatitis C virus","varicella-zoster virus","highest relevance","tick-borne encephalitis virus","respiratory syncytial virus","human immunodeficiency virus","Borrelia","ongoing programmes","prioritization process","Campylobacter","calicivirus","public health relevance","order","epidemiologists","outcome","Germany","Public Health Agency of Sweden","modified prioritization method","hepatitis B","voluntary notifications","self-reported time","Delphi process experts","HIV","SARS","MERS coronavirus","Echinococcus multilocularis","gastro-intestinal infections","Robert Koch Institute","Salmonella","strategic priorities","vector","blood","work","resource allocation","total score","variables"],"language":"en"},

During the outbreak, the premises-level incidence of PEDv was 40.5 percent (90/222 sites). One of the three companies from which data were collected had a lower incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two companies (41.1 and 47.2 percent). Sow sites had the highest incidence of PEDv during the outbreak (80.0 percent). Spatial analysis showed that PEDv was clustered rather than randomly distributed, which suggested that sites near a positive site had increased risk of acquiring PEDv infection. Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. If airborne dissemination played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to correlate with the predominant wind direction. Two methods were used to determine the direction of disease spread\u2014linear direction mean analysis in ArcGIS and the direction test in ClusterSeer. The former method indicated PEDv spread was south to slightly southwest, and the latter indicated spread was to the southeast. The predominant wind direction during the month of the outbreak was toward the south, with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. These findings support the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts between sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs or people. These types of contacts should be evaluated before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms. Although this study did not provide a definitive assessment of airborne spread of PEDv, we believe the findings justify additional research to investigate this potential mechanism of transmission.","publish_time":"2015-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beam, Andrea; Goede, Dane; Fox, Andrew; McCool, Mary Jane; Wall, Goldlin; Haley, Charles; Morrison, Robert","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a263f1ec26e982b0f070dcb721f6e51e7d970889.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4692406.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26709512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["PEDv spread","direction of disease spread","pathogen spread","definitive assessment of airborne spread of PEDv","highest incidence of PEDv","percent","predominant wind direction","direction test","premises-level incidence of PEDv","risk of acquiring PEDv infection","swine sites","Sow sites","linear direction mean analysis","lower incidence","southwest winds","airborne dissemination","airborne mechanisms","hypothesis","Meteorological data","southeast","findings","study","companies","outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","strongest wind gusts","contiguous states","indirect contacts","Spatial analysis","United States","types of contacts","ArcGIS","movement of trucks","counties area","spring","positive site","feed","pigs","additional research","month","potential mechanism of transmission","people","information","ClusterSeer","role","methods","results"],"language":"en"},

Previous work to assess immune function has relied upon relatively crude measures of immunocompetence. However, with next-generation RNA-sequencing, it is now possible to create a profile of gene expression in response to an immune challenge. In this study, captive zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata; adult males) were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle to stimulate the innate immune system. 2 hours after injection, birds were euthanized and hypothalami, spleen, and red blood cells (RBCs) were collected. Taking advantage of the fully sequenced genome of zebra finch, total RNA was isolated, sequenced, and partially annotated in these tissue/cells. RESULTS: In hypothalamus, there were 707 significantly upregulated transcripts, as well as 564 and 144 in the spleen and RBCs, respectively, relative to controls. Also, 155 transcripts in the hypothalamus, 606 in the spleen, and 61 in the RBCs were significantly downregulated. More specifically, a number of immunity-related transcripts (e.g., IL-1\u03B2, RSAD2, SOCS3) were upregulated among tissues/cells. Additionally, transcripts involved in metabolic processes (APOD, LRAT, RBP4) were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential trade-off in expression of genes that regulate immunity and metabolism in birds challenged with LPS. This finding is consistent with a hypothermic response to LPS treatment in small birds. Unlike mammals, birds have nucleated RBCs, and these results support a novel transcriptomic response of avian RBCs to immune challenge.

Ideally, new sampling strategies should be simple to implement, technologically uncomplicated, and applicable to areas where emergence events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals that often exist in sizable populations. As well, many domestic or peridomestic species of mosquitoes will preferentially take blood-meals from humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir to collect human blood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sought to take advantage of this phenomenon by systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trail in Northern Liberia to determine whether pathogen sequences from blood engorged mosquitoes accurately mirror those obtained directly from humans. Specifically, blood was collected from humans via finger-stick and by aspirating bloodfed mosquitoes from the inside of houses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these specimens was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from xenosurveillance and from finger-stick blood collection produced a similar number and quality of reads aligning to two human viruses, GB virus C and hepatitis B virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the first systematic comparison between xenosurveillance and more traditional sampling methodologies, while also demonstrating the viability of xenosurveillance as a tool to sample human blood for circulating pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fauver, Joseph R.; Weger-Lucarelli, James; Fakoli, Lawrence S.; Bolay, Kpehe; Bolay, Fatorma K.; Diclaro, Joseph W.; Brackney, Doug E.; Foy, Brian D.; Stenglein, Mark D.; Ebel, Gregory D.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4ab193f58a20b66aba4237f8d5f33d023bca4fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5880402.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29561834/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006348","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Northern Liberia"],"keyphrases":["human blood","blood engorged mosquitoes","blood collection","use of blood","blood-meals","bloodfed mosquitoes","humans","viability of xenosurveillance","peridomestic species of mosquitoes","human viruses","pathogen sequences","finger","new sampling strategies","emergence events","vertebrate pathogens","GB virus C","hepatitis B virus","traditional sampling methodologies","Novel surveillance strategies","continuous emergence of infectious disease agents","Northern Liberia","DNA","quality of reads","similar number","systematic comparison","hematophagous arthropods","field trail","Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA","study","areas","specimens","untapped reservoir","technique","tool","ubiquitous animals","BACKGROUND","inside of houses","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","sizable populations","METHODOLOGY","advantage","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","end","phenomenon","Samples"],"language":"en"},

However, there are limited data on severe RSV infection requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. This retrospective study described features of RSV-associated PICU admissions in Hong Kong and investigated factors for mortality and duration of PICU stay. METHODS: Children with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection and admitted to the PICUs of all eight government hospitals in Hong Kong between January 2009 and June 2011 were identified from computerized auditing systems and PICU databases. RSV in respiratory samples was detected by direct immunofluorescence and/or viral culture. The relationships between mortality and PICU duration and demographic and clinical factors were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 118 (2.4 %) PICU admissions were identified among 4,912 RSV-positive pediatric cases in all hospitals. Sixty-five (55.6 %) patients were infants. PICU admissions were higher between October and March. Eight (6.8 %) patients died, but only two were infants. RSV-associated mortality was related to prior sick contact, presence of older siblings, neurodevelopmental conditions, chromosomal and genetic diseases, and bacterial co-infections, but none was significant following logistic regression analyses (odds ratio 9.36, 95 % confidence interval 0.91\u201396.03 for prior sick contact, p = 0.060). Chronic lung disease was the only risk factor for the duration of PICU admission (\u03B2 = 0.218, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of RSV-infected children do not require PICU support. There is winter seasonality for RSV-associated PICU admission in Hong Kong. Prior sick contact is the only risk factor for RSV-associated mortality, whereas the presence of chronic lung disease is associated with longer PICU stay.

For countries at risk of introduction of H7N9, such as Vietnam, early detection of H7N9 virus is essential for the early containment of the virus. Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR (iiRT\u2010PCR) is a portable PCR system that can be deployed under field conditions to identify pathogens at the sampling site. Applying PCR at the sampling site will greatly reduce the time to obtain a diagnostic result which allows the veterinary authority to take immediate action to contain disease spreading. OBJECTIVE: To determine analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the portable iiRT\u2010PCR for H7N9 virus detection. METHODS: A panel of 59 virus isolates, including H7N9, avian influenza viruses of subtype H1 to H13, swine and human influenza viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus, were tested by H7 and N9 iiRT\u2010PCR reagents, using probes and primers specific to H7 or N9, in comparison with laboratory\u2010based real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assays to determine analytical sensitivity and specificity. Fifty oropharyngeal samples from experimentally infected chicken and ducks with H7N9 and 50 non\u2010infected control swabs were tested by the H7 iiRT\u2010PCR to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The H7 and N9 iiRT\u2010PCR reagents yielded comparable levels of analytical sensitivity and specificity with real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR for the detection of H7N9 virus. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of H7 iiRT\u2010PCR were 98% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The observed high sensitivity and specificity of iiRT\u2010PCR for H7N9 detection show its potential for early detection of H7N9 in risk\u2010based surveillance.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inui, Ken; Nguyen, Tung; Tseng, Hsin\u2010Jou; Tsai, ChuanFu Mark; Tsai, Yun\u2010Long; Chung, Simon; Padungtod, Pawin; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; Kalpravidh, Wantanee; Claes, Filip","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96f0cf86f03bfe173c1b161ae5936757fb6a9b0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6800302.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR reagents","H7N9 detection","H7N9 virus detection","specificity of iiRT","PCR assays","specificity of H7 iiRT","early detection of H7N9 virus","N9 iiRT","portable PCR system","diagnostic sensitivity","portable iiRT","virus isolates","Newcastle disease virus","Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR","infectious bursal disease virus","comparable levels of analytical sensitivity","observed high sensitivity","diagnostic result","human influenza viruses","real\u2010time RT","early containment","sampling site","avian influenza viruses of subtype H1","infected chicken","risk of introduction","based surveillance","non\u2010infected control swabs","H13","swine","ducks","probes","Vietnam","potential","primers specific","veterinary authority","comparison","laboratory","immediate action","pathogens","oropharyngeal samples","field conditions","CONCLUSION","panel","countries","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","China"],"language":"en"},

Methods We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. Findings Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days. Interpretation The consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.

Targeted in vivo antigen-delivery to cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) has proven to be extraordinarily efficient in stimulating antigen-specific T cell responses. To determine whether this approach would as well be suitable to induce local antiviral effector T cells in the liver we compared different vaccine formulations based on either the targeting of DEC-205 or TLR2/6 on cross-presenting DCs or formulations not involving in vivo DC targeting. As read-outs we used in vivo hepatotropic adenovirus challenge, histology and automated multidimensional fluorescence microscopy (MELC). We show that targeted in vivo antigen delivery to cross-presenting DCs is highly effective in inducing antiviral CTLs capable of eliminating virus-infected hepatocytes, while control vaccine formulation not involving DC targeting failed to induce immunity against hepatotropic virus. Moreover, we observed distinct patterns of CD8(\u002B) T cell interaction with virus-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes in the two DC-targeting groups suggesting that the different vaccine formulations may stimulate distinct types of effector functions. Our findings represent an important step toward the future development of vaccines against hepatotropic viruses and the treatment of patients with hepatic virus infection after liver transplantation to avoid reinfection.","publish_time":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Volckmar, Julia; Gereke, Marcus; Ebensen, Thomas; Riese, Peggy; Philipsen, Lars; Lienenklaus, Stefan; Wohlleber, Dirk; Klopfleisch, Robert; Stegemann-Koniszewski, Sabine; M\u00FCller, Andreas J.; Gruber, Achim D.; Knolle, Percy; Guzman, Carlos A.; Bruder, Dunja","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e232c192b439ef6a844be6a2f40bbbae64469fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5339819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28266658/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43985","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DC targeting","virus-infected hepatocytes","Hepatotropic viruses","cross","DCs","different vaccine formulations","antigen-delivery","antigen delivery","hepatitis C virus","hepatic virus infection","liver transplantation","T cell interaction","local antiviral effector T cells","hepatotropic adenovirus challenge","stimulating antigen-specific T cell responses","control vaccine formulation","life-threatening chronic liver infections","apoptotic hepatocytes","dendritic cells","distinct types of effector functions","antiviral CTLs capable","distinct patterns of CD8","histology","treatment of patients","automated multidimensional fluorescence microscopy","future development of vaccines","important step","millions of people","MELC","groups","immunity","reinfection","read-outs","findings","TLR2","approach"],"language":"en"},

Conclusion Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gautret, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Parola, Philippe; Hoang, Van Thuan; Meddeb, Line; Mailhe, Morgane; Doudier, Barbara; Courjon, Johan; Giordanengo, Val\u00E9rie; Vieira, Vera Esteves; Dupont, Herv\u00E9 Tissot; Honor\u00E9, St\u00E9phane; Colson, Philippe; Chabri\u00E8re, Eric; La Scola, Bernard; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Brouqui, Philippe; Raoult, Didier","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73243d95149d9f2260f3c852599d7d39f4cc8ccc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102549.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920300996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205204/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Untreated patients","hydroxychloroquine treatment","role of hydroxychloroquine","azithromycin","respiratory viral loads","viral load reduction","viral carriage","lower respiratory tract infection symptoms","upper respiratory tract infection symptoms","cases","D6-post inclusion","Day6-post inclusion","lower average","significant reduction","absence of virus","virus elimination","negative controls","Chinese COV","SARS-CoV","single arm protocol","methods French Confirmed COVID","small sample size","survey","disappearance","duration","center","nasopharyngeal swabs","Conclusion","Presence","study","end point","Abstract Background Chloroquine","effect","clinical presentation","Results","literature","hospital setting"],"language":"en"},

The heavily glycosylated IBV spike protein is responsible for binding to host tissues. Glycosylation sites in the spike protein are highly conserved across viral genotypes, suggesting an important role for this modification in the virus life cycle. Here, we analyzed the N-glycosylation of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of IBV strain M41 spike protein and assessed the role of this modification in host receptor binding. Ten single Asn\u2013to\u2013Ala substitutions at the predicted N-glycosylation sites of the M41\u2013RBD were evaluated along with two control Val\u2013to\u2013Ala substitutions. CD analysis revealed that the secondary structure of all variants was retained compared with the unmodified M41\u2013RBD construct. Six of the 10 glycosylation variants lost binding to chicken trachea tissue and an ELISA-presented \u03B12,3-linked sialic acid oligosaccharide ligand. LC/MS(E) glycomics analysis revealed that glycosylation sites have specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Overall, the glycosylation patterns of most variant RBDs were highly similar to those of the unmodified M41\u2013RBD construct. In silico docking experiments with the recently published cryo-EM structure of the M41 IBV spike protein and our glycosylation results revealed a potential ligand receptor site that is ringed by four glycosylation sites that dramatically impact ligand binding. Combined with the results of previous array studies, the glycosylation and mutational analyses presented here suggest a unique glycosylation-dependent binding modality for the M41 spike protein.","publish_time":"2019-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parsons, Lisa M.; Bouwman, Kim M.; Azurmendi, Hugo; de Vries, Robert P.; Cipollo, John F.; Verheije, Monique H.","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eea14a82db80e460ff5860f2b1f009f407ae8a20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6514631.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.007532; http://www.jbc.org/content/294/19/7797.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30902814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycosylation results","glycosylation variants","glycosylation patterns","M41 IBV spike protein","predicted N-glycosylation sites","ligand binding","IBV strain M41 spike protein","unmodified M41","unique glycosylation-dependent binding modality","glycosylated IBV spike protein","host receptor binding","receptor-binding domain","RBD construct","important role","potential ligand receptor site","modification","Ala substitutions","specific proportions of N","glycomics analysis","secondary structure","CD analysis","sialic acid oligosaccharide ligand","host tissues","infectious bronchitis virus","virus life cycle","published cryo-EM structure","results of previous array studies","important respiratory pathogens of poultry","chicken trachea tissue","viral genotypes","mutational analyses","\u03B12","ELISA","Avian coronaviruses","MS","glycan subtypes","variant RBDs","silico docking experiments","control Val","LC","single Asn"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of caveolin-1 (mCav-1) from mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) and study on the roles of mCav-1 in the fish Jak\u2013Stat signaling pathway and in virus infection. The cDNA sequence of mCav-1 was 707bp in size, encoding a protein of 181 amino acids, which was different from the mammalian protein (178 amino acids). The deduced amino acid sequence of mCav-1 shared similar architecture with vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins, but mCav-1 lacked a phosphorylation site (y14). The major subcellular location of mCav-1 was in the caveolae, where the protein appeared to have major functions. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression of the mandarin fish Mx, IRF-1, SOCS1, and SOCS3 genes involved in the poly(I:C)-induced Jak\u2013Stat signaling pathway was impaired by the mCav-1 scaffolding domain peptide (mSDP). In mandarin fish fry (MFF-1) cells, the protein levels of mCav-1 were markedly up-regulated at 12 and 24h post-infection with ISKNV (infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus). In addition, ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells was significantly inhibited by mSDP, and the inhibition was dose-dependent. Thus, ISKNV infection was apparently associated with mCav-1 protein and may utilize the caveolae-related endocytosis pathway.

Among these, several 5\u2032-O-masked analogues of 6-chloropurine-2\u2032-deoxyriboside (e.g., 5\u2032-O-benzoyl, 5\u2032-O-p-methoxybenzoyl, and 5\u2032-O-benzyl analogues) were found to exhibit effective anti-HCV activity. In particular, the 5\u2032-O-benzoyl analogue exhibited the highest potency with an EC50 of 6.1\u03BCM in a cell-based HCV replicon assay. Since the 5\u2032-O-unmasked analogue (i.e., 6-chloropurine-2\u2032-deoxyriboside) was not sufficiently potent (EC50 =47.2\u03BCM), masking of the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group seems to be an effective method for the development of anti-HCV agents. Presently, we hypothesize two roles for the 5\u2032-O-masked analogues: One is the role as an anti-HCV agent by itself, and the other is as a prodrug of its 5\u2032-O-demasked (deprotected) derivative.","publish_time":"2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ikejiri, Masahiro; Ohshima, Takayuki; Kato, Keizo; Toyama, Masaaki; Murata, Takayuki; Shimotohno, Kunitada; Maruyama, Tokumi","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b889b5e979a0b32228441c2fb350b5357134712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125560.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089607007195; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089607007195","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-masked analogues","O-p","O-benzyl analogues","O-benzoyl analogue","O-unmasked analogue","development of anti-HCV agents","effective anti-HCV activity","antiviral agents","hydroxyl groups","\u03BCM","series of nucleoside analogues","EC50","chloropurine","deoxyriboside","cell-based HCV replicon assay","novel anti-hepatitis C virus","effective method","various protective groups","coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","carboxylate","previous study","highest potency","basis","sulfonate","masking","methoxybenzoyl","Abstract","ether","derivative","roles","prodrug"],"language":"en"},

By using the mean-field theory and numerical simulation, we show that both local and contact awareness can raise the epidemic thresholds while the global awareness cannot, which mirrors the recent results of Wu et al. The obtained results point out that individual behaviors in the presence of an infectious disease has a great influence on the epidemic dynamics.

The first stage centered on leadership meetings and consensus building, the second on drafting the new standards with expert focus groups, and the third on a pilot study and subsequent revision. RESULTS: Our new teaching hospital accreditation standards have six categories and 95 standards as follows: educational resources (20 items), teaching and training plans and outcomes (42 items), research and results (9 items), development of clinical faculty and continuing education (8 items), academic exchanges and community education (8 items), and administration (8 items).

Four members of this family, CEACAM1, CEACAM8, CEACAM6, and CEACAM3 (recognized by CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, and CD66d mAbs, respectively), are expressed on human neutrophils. CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, and CD66d antibodies each increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. This increase in neutrophil adhesion caused by CD66 antibodies is blocked by CD18 mAbs and is associated with upregulation of CD11/CD18 on the neutrophil surface. To examine potential interactions of CEACAMs in neutrophil signaling, the effects on neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells of a set of CD66 mAbs was tested following desensitization to stimulation by various combinations of these mAbs. Addition of a CD66 mAb in the absence of calcium results in desensitization of neutrophils to stimulation by that CD66 mAb. The current data show that desensitization of neutrophils to any two CEACAMs results in selective desensitization to those two CEACAMs, while the cells remain responsive to the other two neutrophil CEACAMs. In addition, cells desensitized to CEACAM-3, -6, and -8 were still responsive to stimulation of CEACAM1 by CD66a mAbs. In contrast, desensitization of cells to CEACAM1 and any two of the other CEACAMs left the cells unresponsive to all CD66 mAbs. Cells desensitized to any combination of CEACAMs remained responsive to the unrelated control protein CD63. Thus, while there is significant independence of the four neutrophil CEACAMs in signaling, CEACAM1 appears to play a unique role among the neutrophil CEACAMs. A model in which CEACAMs dimerize to form signaling complexes could accommodate the observations. Similar interactions may occur in other cells expressing CEACAMs.","publish_time":"2008-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skubitz, Keith M; Skubitz, Amy PN","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aba67455b71206b20d9b978e994cb571392dd404.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2628881.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-6-78; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19077207/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutrophil CEACAMs","CEACAMs results","neutrophil adhesion","desensitization of cells","combination of CEACAMs","neutrophil activation","neutrophil surface","potential interactions of CEACAMs","CD66a mAbs","desensitization of neutrophils","set of CD66 mAbs","CD18 mAbs","CD66d mAbs","cells unresponsive","CD66 antibodies","stimulation of CEACAM1","human umbilical vein endothelial cells","following desensitization","human neutrophils","selective desensitization","CD66d antibodies","CD66b","CD66c","Members","Addition","increase","human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers","tumor suppression","tumor promotion","Similar interactions","absence of calcium results","carcinoembryonic antigen family","diverse functions","angiogenesis","effects","various combinations","unrelated control protein CD63","CEACAM3","CEACAM8","CEACAM6","upregulation of CD11","unique role","tissue","current data","significant independence","contrast","complexes","observations","model"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens in historic and contemporary populations, and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. RESULTS: We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p\u003E0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14\u20130.97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone had near-exponential growth, while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed near constant incidences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not airborne. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of \u201Cdeceleration parameters\u201D may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viboud, C\u00E9cile; Simonsen, Lone; Chowell, Gerardo","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe36363444df08c396756a3538ebbe44e00aa8b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4903879.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516000037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436516000037; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2016.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266847/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS"],"locations":["Ebola","Khulna","Uruguay","Japan","West African Ebola","Liberia","Kenema","Sierra Leone"],"keyphrases":["slow growth","Sub-exponential growth profiles","epidemic growth patterns","importance of sub-exponential growth","generalized-growth model","early growth dynamics","substantial growth variations","profile of slower growth","epidemic profiles","near exponential","disease forecasts","mouth disease outbreak","AIDS epidemic","Ebola outbreak","different infectious disease outbreaks","important drivers of disease transmission","Liberia","smallpox outbreak","existing transmission models","West African Ebola epidemic","range of transmission routes","empirical outbreak data","existing mathematical transmission models","Sierra Leone","mean p","districts of Bomi","largest district-level outbreaks","districts of Margibi","variety of viral pathogens","early onset of interventions strategies","risk groups","heterogeneity","reactive behavior changes","significant variation","unique opportunity","contact structures","Bombali","analysis","Kenema","Uruguay","consideration","contemporary populations","better characterization","simulations","geography","findings","HIV","common phenomenon","forecasting purposes","ascending phase","Japan","deceleration parameters","constant incidences","pandemic influenza","San Francisco","CONCLUSIONS","foot","BACKGROUND","Khulna","MATERIALS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods A 10-year retrospective study (January 2006 to December 2015) was conducted. The number of patients assessed, sources and reasons for referral, and treatments provided were reviewed. The numbers of ER assessments and reassessments for abortion, hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy from January 2004 to December 2005 (pre-EPAC) and January 2006 to December 2015 (post-EPAC) were also reviewed. Results There were 11 349 new referrals and 10 764 follow-up visits. The reasons for referral were threatened miscarriage (n = 3568, 31.4%), missed miscarriage (n = 3056, 26.9%), incomplete miscarriage (n = 1064, 9.4%), complete miscarriage (n = 991, 8.7%), ectopic pregnancy (n = 857, 7.6%), hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 139, 1.2%), and others (n = 1674, 14.8%). There has been a significant decreasing trend (tau = \u22120.60, P = 0.0127) and a significant decrease in the post-EPAC rate of ER reassessments (P = 0.0396) for hemorrhage, with a concomitant decrease in EPAC visits for hemorrhage. In addition, there has been a significant increasing trend (tau = 0.64, P = 0.0081) and a significant increase in the post-EPAC rate of ER assessments (P = 0.00001) for ectopic pregnancies. Conclusion Over the 10-year period, the EPAC has remained a vital service for managing early pregnancy complications for women. However, the clinic has not yet had a sustained impact on ER visits for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage. It is possible that a reduction in ER assessments and reassessments for early pregnancy complications can be achieved through a clinic with daily access.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinnaduwage, Lakmini; Honeyford, Joanne; Lackie, Elyse; Tunde-Byass, Modupe","journal":"Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ceeb2a3a137a1a1a4a86614ce734f07afea72d4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105035.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2017.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1701216317309118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103874/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1701216317309118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPAC","ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EPAC visits","ectopic pregnancy","ER visits","post-EPAC rate of ER assessments","post-EPAC rate of ER reassessments","pre-EPAC","hemorrhage","management of early pregnancy complications","early pregnancy assessment clinic","numbers of ER assessments","significant decrease","incomplete miscarriage","significant increase","follow-up visits","ectopic pregnancies","significant decreasing trend","significant increasing trend","tau","reasons","year retrospective study","sustained value","sustained impact","concomitant decrease","year period","effect","abortion","incidence emergency room","vital service","sources","new referrals","reduction","Methods","women","number of patients","hyperemesis gravidarum","Results","Abstract Objective","Conclusion","daily access","treatments","addition"],"language":"en"},

During the winter of 2008\u20132009, 73 respiratory specimens collected from 53 children under 2 years of age and admitted to an ICU were tested. At least one virus was detected in 78% (57/73) of the samples. The virological diagnosis was based on single infections in 65% (37/57) and on multiple infections in 35% (20/57) of cases. The array assay revealed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 73.6% (42/57) of the samples and rhinovirus in 24.6% (14/57), either on their own or in co\u2010infections. All viruses identified in single and multiple infections were tested, taking into account clinical features, risk factors, and severity criteria. Children with no risk factors presented more multiple infections, up to 42% of cases, than children with at least one risk factor.

Prior to 2014, MERS-CoV was mostly associated with sporadic cases of human illness, of presumed zoonotic origin, though chains of person-to-person transmission in the healthcare setting were reported. In spring 2014, large healthcare-associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection occurred in Jeddah and Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To date the epidemiological information published by public health investigators in affected jurisdictions has been relatively limited. However, it is important that the global public health community have access to information on the basic epidemiological features of the outbreak to date, including the basic reproduction number (R0) and best estimates of case-fatality rates (CFR). We sought to address these gaps using a publicly available line listing of MERS-CoV cases. Methods: R0 was estimated using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment (\u201CIDEA\u201D) method, while period-specific case fatality rates that incorporated non-attributed death data were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: 707 cases were available for evaluation. 52% of cases were identified as primary, with the rest being secondary. IDEA model fits suggested a higher R0 in Jeddah (3.5-6.7) than in Riyadh (2.0-2.8); control parameters suggested more rapid reduction in transmission in the former city than the latter. The model accurately projected final size and end date of the Riyadh outbreak based on information available prior to the outbreak peak; for Jeddah, these projections were possible once the outbreak peaked. Overall case-fatality was 40%; depending on the timing of 171 deaths unlinked to case data, outbreak CFR could be higher, lower, or equivalent to pre-outbreak CFR. Conclusions: Notwithstanding imperfect data, inferences about MERS-CoV epidemiology important for public health preparedness are possible using publicly available data sources. The R0 estimated in Riyadh appears similar to that seen for SARS-CoV, but CFR appears higher, and indirect evidence suggests control activities ended these outbreaks. These data suggest this disease should be regarded with equal or greater concern than the related SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2014-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Majumder, Maimuna S.; Rivers, Caitlin; Lofgren, Eric; Fisman, David","journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4322060.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.98d2f8f3382d84f390736cd5f5fe133c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25685622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["Middle East","Jeddah","Riyadh","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["CoV cases","Riyadh outbreak","case data","CoV infection","MERS-CoV epidemiology important","pre-outbreak CFR","information available","higher R0","outbreak peak","related SARS-CoV","available data sources","imperfect data","Jeddah","available line listing of MERS","Overall case-fatality","epidemiological information","large healthcare-associated outbreaks of MERS","public health preparedness","public health investigators","period-specific case fatality rates","global public health community","best estimates of case","non-attributed death data","end date","person transmission","sporadic cases of human illness","basic epidemiological features","IDEA model fits","source of severe respiratory illness","chains of person","control parameters","control activities","healthcare setting","basic reproduction number","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","access","inferences","presumed zoonotic origin","indirect evidence","projected final size","exponential adjustment","rapid reduction","renal failure","greater concern","incidence decay","Background","Monte Carlo simulation","affected jurisdictions","projections","deaths","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","gaps","spring","Conclusions","rest","city","timing","disease","Results","evaluation","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV precursors still exist and the likelihood of future outbreaks in the human population is high. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP) is an attractive target for pharmaceutical development because it is essential for virus replication and is conserved among human coronaviruses. A yeast-based assay was established for PLP activity that relies on the ability of PLP to induce a pronounced slow-growth phenotype when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Induction of the slow-growth phenotype was shown to take place over a 60-hour time course, providing the basis for conducting a screen for small molecules that restore growth by inhibiting the function of PLP. Five chemical suppressors of the slow-growth phenotype were identified from the 2000 member NIH Diversity Set library. One of these, NSC158362, potently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in cell culture without toxic effects on cells, and it specifically inhibited SARS-CoV replication but not influenza virus replication. The effect of NSC158362 on PLP protease, deubiquitinase and anti-interferon activities was investigated but the compound did not alter these activities. Another suppressor, NSC158011, demonstrated the ability to inhibit PLP protease activity in a cell-based assay. The identification of these inhibitors demonstrated a strong functional connection between the PLP-based yeast assay, the inhibitory compounds, and SARS-CoV biology. Furthermore the data with NSC158362 suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication that may involve an unknown activity of PLP, or alternatively a direct effect on a cellular target that modifies or bypasses PLP function in yeast and mammalian cells.","publish_time":"2011-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frieman, Matthew; Basu, Dipanwita; Matthews, Krystal; Taylor, Justin; Jones, Grant; Pickles, Raymond; Baric, Ralph; Engel, Daniel A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbf1ce71db9a70babb5b4902d23438c1956125c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3229576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22164298/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028479","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PLP activity","ability of PLP","function of PLP","inhibited SARS-CoV replication","SARS-CoV precursors","SARS-CoV papain","PLP protease activity","SARS-CoV biology","PLP-based yeast assay","unknown activity of PLP","inhibition of SARS","bypasses PLP function","yeast-based assay","pronounced slow-growth phenotype","cell-based assay","influenza virus replication","effect of NSC158362","cell culture","cellular target","attractive target","mammalian cells","human population","direct effect","human coronaviruses","anti-interferon activities","inhibitory compounds","deubiquitinase","novel mechanism","toxic effects","strong functional connection","basis","likelihood of future outbreaks","Severe acute respiratory coronavirus","pharmaceutical development","member NIH Diversity Set library","inhibitors","screen","place","animal reservoirs","hour time course","small molecules","chemical suppressors","data","Induction","identification","NSC158011","cerevisiae","cases","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Variable numbers of small ORFs are present between the various conserved genes (ORF1ab, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) and downstream to nucleocapsid gene in different coronavirus lineages. Phylogenetically, three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, with Betacoronavirus consisting of subgroups A, B, C and D, exist.

Recombination in coronaviruses was most notable between different strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), between different strains of infectious bronchitis virus, between MHV and bovine coronavirus, between feline coronavirus (FCoV) type I and canine coronavirus generating FCoV type II, and between the three genotypes of human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1). Codon usage bias in coronaviruses were observed, with HCoV-HKU1 showing the most extreme bias, and cytosine deamination and selection of CpG suppressed clones are the two major independent biological forces that shape such codon usage bias in coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2010-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Patrick C.

Seventeen MS and 11 control brain extracts were sequenced, yielding 4\u201310 million sequences (\u201Creads\u201D) each. Over-representation of sequence from at least one of 12 viral taxa was observed in 7 of the 17 MS samples. Sequences resembling other viruses previously implicated in the pathogenesis of MS were not significantly enriched in any of the diseased brain specimens. Sequences from GB virus C (GBV-C), a flavivirus not previously isolated from brain, were enriched in one of the MS samples. GBV-C in this brain specimen was confirmed by specific amplification in this single MS brain specimen, but not in the 30 other MS brain samples available. The entire 9.4 kb sequence of this GBV-C isolate is reported here. This study shows the feasibility of deep sequencing for the detection of occult viral infections in the brains of deceased persons with MS. The first isolation of GBV-C from human brain is reported here.","publish_time":"2012-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kriesel, John D.; Hobbs, Maurine R.; Jones, Brandt B.; Milash, Brett; Nagra, Rashed M.; Fischer, Kael F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86fca5af635ee9425e3375140fb48cbe6d429411.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3297595.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0031886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22412845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS samples","single MS brain specimen","MS brain samples available","pathogenesis of MS","human brain","viral sequences","Normalized MS specimen","GBV-C isolate","diseased brain specimens","normal control brain specimens","control brain extracts","viral database","viral taxa","isolation of GBV","GB virus C","viral taxon","brains of deceased persons","detection of occult viral infections","flavivirus","frozen specimens","normal controls","hepatitis G","bp reads","feasibility of deep sequencing","non-redundant database","Over-representation of sequence","non-pathogenic lymphotropic virus","specific amplification","central nervous system","demyelinating disease of unknown origin","rates","distribution of hits","Americans","ribosomal RNAs","study","GenBank","Multiple sclerosis","Illumina GAII","viruses","blood donors","serum","individual"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as a target and epitopes (B cell, IFN-\u03B3 and T cell) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected T cell epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the world\u2019s population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and twelve MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the vaccine. The allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic and antigenic. Molecular docking demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed vaccine needs to be experimentally validated.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tahir ul Qamar, Muhammad; Rehman, Abdur; Ashfaq, Usman Ali; Awan, Muhammad Qasim; Fatima, Israr; Shahid, Farah; Chen, Ling-Ling","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.970343","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEV","MHC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["effective vaccine","MEV construct","proposed vaccine","SARS-COV","Selected T cell epitopes","effective multi-epitope vaccine","structural details of MEV","strong binding affinity of MEV","B cell","MHC class","effective drug","amino acids long MEV","safety","adjuvant","antigenic proteins","suitable linkers","Coronavirus disease","cure of COVID","immunogenicity response","HLA-binding alleles","severe acute respiratory coronavirus","significant interactions","antigenicity","silico cloning","increased expression","IFN-\u03B3","physiochemical properties","pneumonia","TLR3","target","Escherichia coli","coverage","immunogenic profile","order","Codon optimization","Molecular docking","allergenicity","TLR8","world\u2019s population","system","date","Wuhan","China","study"],"language":"en"},

In mammals, oxygen and carbon dioxide are transmitted through a complex respiratory tract, consisting of the nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, and lung. Exposure to ambient air throughout the lifespan imposes vulnerability of the respiratory system to environmental challenges that can contribute toward development of disease. The importance of the respiratory system to human health is supported by statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; in 2015, chronic lower respiratory diseases were the third leading cause of death in the United States. In light of the significant mortality associated with respiratory conditions that afflict all ages of the human population, this review will focus on basic and preclinical research conducted in nonhuman primate models of respiratory disease. In comparison with other laboratory animals, the nonhuman primate lung most closely resembles the human lung in structure, physiology, and mucosal immune mechanisms. Studies defining the influence of inhaled microbes, pollutants, or allergens on the nonhuman primate lung have provided insight on disease pathogenesis, with the potential for elucidation of molecular targets leading to new treatment modalities. Vaccine trials in nonhuman primates have been crucial for confirmation of safety and protective efficacy against infectious diseases of the lung in a laboratory animal model that recapitulates pathology observed in humans. In looking to the future, nonhuman primate models of respiratory diseases will continue to be instrumental for translating biomedical research for improvement of human health.","publish_time":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Lisa A; Royer, Christopher M; Pinkerton, Kent E; Schelegle, Edward S","journal":"ILAR Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a120a77edc5368a2fa52075c317cebf9701c3345.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5886323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29216343/; https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article-pdf/58/2/269/24325283/ilx030.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar/ilx030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["respiratory system","nonhuman primate lung","human lung","respiratory conditions","nonhuman primate models of respiratory diseases","complex respiratory tract","chronic lower respiratory diseases","nonhuman primates","human population","disease pathogenesis","Disease Control","development of disease","improvement of human health","infectious diseases","preclinical research","biomedical research","laboratory animals","laboratory animal model","leading cause of death","structures","confirmation of safety","protective efficacy","physiology","lifespan","vulnerability","allergens","elucidation of molecular targets","Prevention","potential","pollutants","statistics","influence of inhaled microbes","insight","integrated network of organs","carbon dioxide","nasal passages","new treatment modalities","environmental challenges","function","ambient air","pathology","Centers","review","pharynx","larynx","significant mortality","mucosal immune mechanisms","future","United States","Vaccine trials","mammals","oxygen","gas exchange","Studies","Exposure"],"language":"en"},

Here, we identify a viral protease as a target of NO. The life cycle of many viruses depends upon viral proteases that cleave viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides. NO inactivates the Coxsackievirus protease 3C, an enzyme necessary for the replication of Coxsackievirus. NO S-nitrosylates the cysteine residue in the active site of protease 3C, inhibiting protease activity and interrupting the viral life cycle. Substituting a serine residue for the active site cysteine renders protease 3C resistant to NO inhibition. Since cysteine proteases are critical for virulence or replication of many viruses, bacteria, and parasites, S-nitrosylation of pathogen cysteine proteases may be a general mechanism of antimicrobial host defenses.","publish_time":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saura, Marta; Zaragoza, Carlos; McMillan, Audrey; Quick, Richard A; Hohenadl, Christine; Lowenstein, John M; Lowenstein, Charles J","journal":"Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2cd9385b6fe84f42f1f6d0c99053c3ec6e2bcdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129050.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761300800035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761300800035","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteases","Coxsackievirus protease","cysteine residue","active site of protease","protease activity","active site cysteine","pathogen cysteine proteases","viral life cycle","viral polyproteins","replication of Coxsackievirus","C resistant","viruses","S-nitrosylation","serine residue","antimicrobial mechanisms","S-nitrosylates","general mechanism of antimicrobial host defenses","enzyme necessary","parasites","virulence","variety of intracellular pathogens","bacteria","target of","individual polypeptides","inhibition","nitric oxide"],"language":"en"},

Increasing data indicate that PRRSV strains differ in virulence in infected pigs and are biologically, antigenically, and genetically heterogeneous. It is evident that the current vaccines, based on a single PRRSV strain, are not effective in protecting against infections with the genetically diverse field strains of PRRSV. The recent outbreaks of atypical or acute PRRS in vaccinated pigs have raised a serious concern about the efficacy of the current vaccines and provided the impetus for developing more effective vaccines. Special attention in this review is given to published work on antigenic, pathogenic and genetic variations of PRRSV and its potential implications for vaccine efficacy and development. Although there are ample data documenting the heterogeneous nature of PRRSV strains, information regarding how the heterogeneity is generated and what clinical impact it may have is very scarce. The observed heterogeneity will likely pose a major obstacle for effective prevention and control of PRRS. There remains an urgent need for fundamental research on this virus to understand the basic biology and the mechanism of heterogeneity and pathogenesis of PRRSV.","publish_time":"2000-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, X.

CHAC1 degrades glutathione and is associated with ER stress and apoptosis pathways. In this study, we examined the roles of CHAC1 in the inflammatory response and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. First, we confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction that CHAC1 mRNA was overexpressed in hAECBs from patients without CF compared with the expression in hAECBs from patients with CF upon Pa (PAK strain) infection. Moreover, the Pa virulence factors LPS and flagellin were shown to induce CHAC1 expression in cells from patients without CF. Using NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells, we found that LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression was PERK-independent and involved ATF4. Additionally, using CHAC1 small interfering RNA, we showed that reduced CHAC1 expression in the context of LPS and flagellin stimulation was associated with modulation of inflammatory markers and alteration of NF-\u03BAB signaling. Finally, we showed that Pa was not able to induce apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. Our results suggest that CHAC1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation in bronchial cells during Pa infection and may explain the excessive inflammation present in the respiratory tracts of patients with CF.","publish_time":"2018-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perra, L\u00E9a; Balloy, Viviane; Foussigni\u00E8re, Tobias; Moissenet, Didier; Petat, Hortense; Mungrue, Imran N.; Touqui, Lhousseine; Corvol, Harriet; Chignard, Michel; Guillot, Loic","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcfa47b076db144f586108d35f5d43e5100c02d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6282009.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30555487/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF","CF."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of CHAC1","reduced CHAC1 expression","CF","LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression","Pa infection","bronchial cells","healthy patients","NCI-H292 cells","hAECBs","NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells","CHAC1 small interfering RNA","respiratory tracts of patients","Pa virulence factors LPS","primary human airway epithelial cells","context of LPS","chronic inflammation","regulation of inflammation","apoptosis pathways","excessive inflammation present","inflammatory response","flagellin stimulation","bronchial epithelium","involved ATF4","modulation of inflammatory markers","ChaC glutathione-specific \u03B3-glutamylcyclotransferase","reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction","PERK-independent","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","baseline","alteration of NF","PAK strain","ER stress","lungs","cystic fibrosis","\u03BAB","study","results"],"language":"en"},

To simultaneously detect viruses that are involved in the aetiology of respiratory infections, we used a DNA/RNA microarray assay that identifies 17 different viruses or viral subtypes. Rhinopharyngeal washes were taken from 611 children (aged 1 month to 14 years) who presented in the emergency department with respiratory infections from June 2010 to June 2011 and were treated as outpatients (299, 48.9%) or hospitalized (312, 51.1%). Lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed more often in hospitalized children (68% versus 36%, p 0.001). Of 397 children in which microarrays detected viral infection (70.1%), a single virus was found in 228 (57.4%) and two or more viruses in 169 (42.5%). The most prevalent viruses among children with positive samples were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 225 (56.6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 118 (29.7%), rhinovirus (RV) in 73 (18.4%), followed by influenza in 56 (14.1%), adenoviruses in 31 (7.8%), bocavirus in 25 (6.3%), human metapneumovirus in 15 (3.7%) and enteroviruses in 12 (3%).

In this study, we isolated a Yokose virus from a serum sample of Myotis daubentonii (order Chiroptera, family Vespertilionidae) collected in Yunnan province, China in 2013. METHODS: The serum specimens of bat were used to inoculate in BHK-21 and Vero E6 cells for virus isolation. Then the viral complete genome sequence was obtained and was used for phylogenetic analysis performed by BEAST software package. RESULTS: The virus was shown to have cytopathic effects in mammalian cells (BHK-21 and Vero E6). Genome sequencing indicated that it has a single open reading frame (ORF), with a genome of 10,785 nucleotides in total. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genome suggests that XYBX1332 is a Yokose virus (YOKV) of the genus Flavivirus. Nucleotide and amino acid homology levels of the ORF of XYBX1332 and Oita-36, the original strain of YOKV, were 72 and 82%, respectively. The ORFs of XYBX1332 and Oita-36 encode 3422 and 3425 amino acids, respectively. In addition, the non-coding regions (5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions [UTRs]) of these two strains differ in length and the homology of the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs was 81.5 and 78.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The isolation of YOKV (XYBX1332) from inland China thousands of kilometers from Yokosuka, Japan, suggests that the geographical distribution of YOKV is not limited to the islands of Japan and that it can also exist in the inland areas of Asia. However, there are large differences between the Chinese and Japanese YOKV strains in viral genome.","publish_time":"2019-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Yun; Ren, Xiaojie; Xu, Ziqian; Fu, Shihong; Li, Xiaolong; Zhang, Hailin; Yang, Weihong; Zhang, Yuzhen; Liang, Guodong","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e00a4c6f4faed178e0f2c24b7c2678c9404f84c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6330390.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1107-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero","ORF","YOKV"],"locations":["Yokosuka","Japan","Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["Yokose virus","viral genome","isolation of YOKV","virus isolation","ORF of XYBX1332","Genome sequencing","Japanese YOKV strains","ORFs of XYBX1332","viral complete genome sequence","original strain of YOKV","geographical distribution of YOKV","BHK","Vero E6 cells","Yokosuka","phylogenetic analysis","Oita","genus Flavivirus","islands of Japan","UTRs","family Vespertilionidae","family Flaviviridae","mammalian cells","inland China thousands of kilometers","amino acid homology levels","untranslated regions","amino acids","serum specimens of bat","inland areas of Asia","non-coding regions","serum sample of Myotis daubentonii","order Chiroptera","Chinese","cytopathic effects","bats","Miniopterus fuliginosus","single open reading frame","BEAST software package","Yunnan province","large differences","new member","addition","METHODS","BACKGROUND","length","nucleotides","total","CONCLUSION","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

EVs infection range from mild to severe disease, including mild respiratory illness, diarrhea, poliomyelitis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, aseptic meningitis, and encephalitis. In the Asia-Pacific region, for example, one of the best studied enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been associated with pandemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children, particularly those under the age of five. Serious HFMD cases are associated with neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, brainstem encephalitis, and have been associated with as many as 1000s of deaths in children and infants from 2008 to 2017, in China. More than 90% of laboratory confirmed deaths due to HMFD are associated with EV71. However, little is known about the pathogenesis of EVs. Studies have reported that EVs-infected patients with severe complications show elevated serum concentrations of IL-1\u03B2. The secretion of IL-1\u03B2 is mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome during EV71 and CVB3 infection. Enteroviruses 2B and 3D proteins play an important role in activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, while 3C and 2A play important roles in antagonizing the activation of NLRP3 and the secretion of IL-1\u03B2. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the activation and regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, particularly how viral proteins regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These insights into the relationship between the NLRP3 inflammasome and the pathogenesis of EVs infection may ultimately inform the development of novel antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xia; Qi, Jianli; Lei, Xiaobo; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/423e1f15afb86012057acacc26d0766aa4bc582a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6398425.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30858838/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00321","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMFD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["activation of NLRP3 inflammasome","NLRP3 inflammasome activation","pathogenesis of EVs infection","EVs infection range","EV71","severe disease","mouth disease","secretion of IL","EVs-infected patients","severe complications","aseptic meningitis","foot","CVB3 infection","children","Enteroviruses","play important roles","neurological complications","viral proteins","D proteins","elevated serum concentrations of IL","pandemics of hand","brainstem encephalitis","s of deaths","mild respiratory illness","Serious HFMD cases","acute flaccid paralysis","diarrhea","poliomyelitis","example","molecular mechanisms","current knowledge","substantial threat","regulation","best studied enterovirus","development of novel antiviral drugs","Asia-Pacific region","public health","infants","HMFD","relationship","review","laboratory","Studies","insights","age","China"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it is recommended to maintain RAS blockade during the current corona virus pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sungha; Lee, Hae Young; Cho, Eun Joo; Sung, Ki Chul; Kim, Juhan; Kim, Dae-Hee; Ihm, Sang-Hyun; Kim, Kwang-il; Sohn, Il-Suk; Chung, Wook-Jin; Kim, Hyeon Chang; Ryu, Sung Kee; Pyun, Wook Bum; Shin, Jinho","journal":"Clin Hypertens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f7e827d3b7505f380f6f6c77eceea6207b98f82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391169/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40885-020-00144-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["renin angiotensin aldosterone system","Renin-Angiotensin","RAS blockade","Antihypertensive drugs","RAS inhibitors","infection","sympathetic nervous system","antihypertensive drug therapy","viral entry","viral surface protein","theoretical concerns of increased ACE2 expression","sodium balance","homeostasis mechanisms","current corona virus pandemic","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus","cell membrane","hypotension","COVID","evidence","common cause of death","complication","sepsis","old subject","pharmacologic agent","world","animal studies","Pneumonia","fact","cytoplasm","enzyme","elderly subjects"],"language":"en"},

It causes respiratory infection with signs and symptoms of common infectious agents. Thus, clinicians sometimes may miss the H1N1 patient. Clinical laboratory tests are important for the diagnosis of the H1N1 infection. There are several tests available, however, the rapid test and direct fluorescence antigen test are unable to rule out the influenza virus infection and viral culture test is time consuming. Therefore, nucleic acid amplification techniques based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays are regarded as a specific diagnosis to confirm the influenza virus infection. Although the nucleic acid-based techniques are highly sensitive and specific, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase could limit the utility of the techniques. In addition, their use depends on the availability, cost and throughput of the diagnostic techniques. To overcome these drawbacks, evaluation and development of the techniques should be continued. This review provides an overview of various techniques for specific diagnosis of influenza infection.","publish_time":"2013-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Dae-Ki; Poudel, Barun","journal":"Yonsei Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7bbdd316b8d64ca1001b67b96c06efd531893b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3635619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549796/; https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2013.54.3.560","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 infection","influenza virus infection","specific diagnosis of influenza infection","diagnostic techniques","pandemic influenza","nucleic acid-based techniques","respiratory infection","nucleic acid amplification techniques","overview of various techniques","influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","H1N1 patient","rapid test","viral culture test","direct fluorescence antigen test","tests available","Clinical laboratory tests","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays","signs","high mutation rate","cost","symptoms of common infectious agents","time consuming","throughput","utility","use","availability","evaluation","development","review","drawbacks","clinicians","addition","countries"],"language":"en"},

Since Iran is one of the most important countries on the walking path of Arbaeen and has a vital role in providing health services to pilgrims, the experiences of health challenges by participants is of key importance. The aim of this study is to explore stakeholders\u2019 experiences on the health system\u0027s preparedness and challenges, and to provide suggestions for preventing infectious diseases during the Arbaeen mass gathering. Methods: A qualitative research method was used with a conventional content analysis approach. The number of participants was 17, including 13 executive managers and 4 health policymakers who entered the study among participants. Semi-structured interviews were used to generate the data. Interviews were analyzed by means of content analysis after face-to-face interviews. Results: Data analysis resulted in the extraction of four main themes and 11 sub-themes. Health infrastructure defects in Iraq has three sub-themes (health abandonment in Iraq, the weaknesses in health culture and problems related to the health system); poor control of the causative factors of infectious diseases has three sub-themes (the underlying factors of the prevalence of contagious diseases, health system response to communicable diseases and ignoring the risks of the Arbaeen ceremony); the low perception of risk in pilgrims has three sub-themes (lack of awareness in pilgrims, fatalism in pilgrims and unhygienic belief in pilgrims); and the ineffectiveness of health education has two sub-themes (training shortage in the targeted group and educational content problems) that shows participant\u2019s experiences of the health system\u0027s challenges for coping with infectious diseases during the Arbaeen ceremony. Conclusion: Pilgrim-based training, planning and controlling other challenges may change these threats to opportunities and improve the health of participants of the mass gathering of Arbaeen in the region.","publish_time":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karampourian, Arezou; Ghomian, Zohreh; Khorasani-Zavareh, Davoud","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73aea1df4694235764281acbc9a19b37525b773e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6234742.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.15290.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran","Iraq"],"keyphrases":["health of participants","health policymakers","health services","health culture","health abandonment","experiences of health challenges","health system\u0027s challenges","health system response","health system\u0027s preparedness","sub-themes","pilgrims","Health infrastructure defects","ineffectiveness of health education","lack of health system preparedness","Arbaeen mass","communicable diseases","main themes","Arbaeen ceremony","causative factors of infectious diseases","prevalence of contagious diseases","number of participants","Data analysis","educational content problems","walking path of Arbaeen","Iraq","participant\u2019s experiences","common problems","stakeholders\u2019 experiences","conventional content analysis approach","mass gatherings","study","face-to-face interviews","Semi-structured interviews","underlying factors","training shortage","lack of awareness","Pilgrim-based training","targeted group","fatalism","weaknesses","poor control","low perception of risk","vital role","unhygienic belief","qualitative research method","important countries","extraction","risks","Background","opportunities","executive managers","key importance","Methods","Conclusion","threats","suggestions","Results","region","Iran","aim"],"language":"en"},

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10(\u22124)-2000 TCID(50)/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Daniel K W; Pan, Yang; Cheng, Samuel M S; Hui, Kenrie P Y; Krishnan, Pavithra; Liu, Yingzhi; Ng, Daisy Y M; Wan, Carrie K C; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/153385393dc1d0bd2ca687b7c5bf8e4cca46ee40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031583/; https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","nCoV-infected patients","established assays","early identification of infected patients","human samples","positive control","early identification of patients","negative control samples","rapid detection","bat SARS","positive standards","panel of positive","novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin","detection limits","human transmission","negative controls","reaction","step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays","n-CoV","Molecular tests","respiratory specimens","provinces of China","acute respiratory disease","major city of China","different regions","related viruses","health care workers","Wuhan","ORF1b","Outbreaks","cells","orders of magnitude","DNA plasmids","dynamic range","RNA","BACKGROUND","coronaviruses","viral genome","Travel-associated cases","primer","probe sets","2x10","RESULTS","addition","CONCLUSIONS","TCID","copies","countries","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Using genetically diverse animals from incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross mouse panel, we demonstrate a greatly expanded range of phenotypes relative to classical mouse models of SARS-CoV infection including lung pathology, weight loss and viral titer. Genetic mapping revealed several loci contributing to differential disease responses, including an 8.5Mb locus associated with vascular cuffing on chromosome 3 that contained 23 genes and 13 noncoding RNAs. Integrating phenotypic and genetic data narrowed this region to a single gene, Trim55, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a role in muscle fiber maintenance. Lung pathology and transcriptomic data from mice genetically deficient in Trim55 were used to validate its role in SARS-CoV-induced vascular cuffing and inflammation. These data establish the Collaborative Cross platform as a powerful genetic resource for uncovering genetic contributions of complex traits in microbial disease severity, inflammation and virus replication in models of outbred populations.","publish_time":"2015-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gralinski, Lisa E.; Ferris, Martin T.; Aylor, David L.; Whitmore, Alan C.; Green, Richard; Frieman, Matthew B.; Deming, Damon; Menachery, Vineet D.; Miller, Darla R.; Buus, Ryan J.; Bell, Timothy A.; Churchill, Gary A.; Threadgill, David W.; Katze, Michael G.; McMillan, Leonard; Valdar, William; Heise, Mark T.; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4599853.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26452100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic data","genetic networks","Genetic mapping","powerful genetic resource","genetic contributions of complex traits","SARS-CoV","lung pathology","complex disease outcomes","Trim55","inflammation","role","transcriptomic data","vascular cuffing","classical mouse models of SARS","Collaborative Cross mouse panel","microbial disease severity","Collaborative Cross platform","differential disease responses","CoV infection","host genes","models of outbred populations","virus replication","weight loss","incipient lines","E3 ubiquitin ligase","mice","region","single gene","range of phenotypes relative","Mb locus","loci","viral titer","muscle fiber maintenance","chromosome","diverse animals","New systems genetics approaches","noncoding RNAs"],"language":"en"},

However, lung epithelial cells are increasingly recognized as active effectors of microbial defence, contributing to both innate and adaptive immune function in the lower respiratory tract. These cells express an ample repertoire of pattern recognition receptors with specificity for conserved microbial and host motifs. Modern molecular techniques have uncovered the complexity of the lower respiratory tract microbiome. The interaction between the microbiota and the airway epithelium is key to understanding how stable immune homeostasis is maintained. Loss of epithelial integrity following exposure to infection can result in the onset of inflammation in susceptible individuals and may culminate in lung disease. Here we discuss the current knowledge regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the pulmonary epithelium interacts with the lung microbiome in shaping immunity in the lung. Specifically, we focus on the interactions between the lung microbiome and the cells of the conducting airways in modulating immune cell regulation, and how defects in barrier structure and function may culminate in lung disease.

While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients. Recent publications have re-examined the use of Chloroquine (CQ) and/or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential therapeutic option for these patients. In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment. Both CQ and HCQ demonstrated promising in vitro results, however, such data have not yet been translated into meaningful in vivo studies. While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary.

The correlation between ACE2 and immune infiltration level and the type markers of immune cells was investigated in TIMER database. A prognosis analysis based on the expression levels of ACE2 was further performed in related immune cells subgroup. The ACE2 promoter methylation profile was tested in the UALCAN database. In addition, we used GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to elucidate the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. ACE2 was elevated in UCEC and KIRP, and high ACE2 had a favorable prognosis. The expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage in KIRP, B cell, CD4\u002BT cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell immune infiltration levels in UCEC. ACE2 was significantly positively correlated with the type markers of B cells and neutrophils, macrophages in UCEC, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with the type markers of macrophages. High ACE2 expression level had a favorable prognosis in different enriched immune cells subgroups in UCEC and KIRP. And the promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced.

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1\u2013specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"alam, Intikhab; Kamau, Allan; Kulmanov, Maxat; Arold, Stefan T.; Pain, Arnab; Gojobori, Takashi; Duarte, Carlos M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f47a0b91bff84c2c89082bd93fe8ce2ebd686cf0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1b4ab28a9391d516e1753874c73d2d244104f825.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.952895","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hexamethylene"],"organizations":["SARS","PBM","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of SARS","SARS protein E","SARS clade","SARS-Cov2","SARS E protein inhibitors","key functional regions of SARS","protein E subcluster","envelope protein E","spike protein","human use","use of approved drugs","vaccines","ion-channel","ion channel","receptor binding domain","key functional features","PBM","PDZ-binding Motif","human receptor ACE2","development of ARDS","host cells1","S proteins","leading cause of death","escalating health","therapy","lungs","viral entry","acute respiratory distress syndrome","urgent solutions","detection","structural differences","RBD","specific neutralizing antibodies","variant","increased edema","prime target","Hexamethylene amiloride9","core gene clusters present","inflammasome","comparative pangenomic analysis","sequenced Betacoronaviruses","economic impacts","Amantadine","casualties","novel coronavirus","similar2","global emergency","cytokine storm","spread","results","animal models","preventive measures","COVID","infection7","SB2035805","survival"],"language":"en"},

These fingerprints provide molecular evidence of recombination at the level of RNA and demonstrate the potential of RNA recombination for producing genetic diversity among picornaviruses.","publish_time":"1982-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"King, Andrew M.Q.; McCahon, David; Slade, William R.; Newman, John W.I.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b86a3636b5566548024bfe7c74fbb1378d90c9e6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867482904548; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867482904548","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel recombinant proteins","virus-induced proteins","coat proteins","inheritance of proteins","level of RNA","stranded RNA","single molecule of single","potential of RNA recombination","RNAase T1 fingerprints of virus RNA","single genetic crossovers","recombinant type","recombinant aphthoviruses","genetic diversity","generated recombinants","molecular evidence of recombination","temperature-sensitive mutants","parent","types of protein pattern","different subtype strains","cells","representatives","approximate crossover sites","central P34-coding region","aphthovirus genome","picornaviruses","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

An Italian survey","doi":"10.1016/j.jse.2020.05.003","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"els-covid","abstract":"Abstract Background Because of the rapid spreading of COVID-19, on March 8th, Italy became a \u0022protected area\u0022: people are told not to leave their homes unless for an essential reason. Aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of our Trauma Centre, relative to shoulder and elbow, in 30 days starting from March 8th, 2020, the first day of restrictions in Italy, and to compare it with the same days of 2019 to weight the impact of Covid-19 on the shoulder and elbow trauma. Materials and methods Patients managed in our Trauma Centre between 8th March 2020 and 8th April 2020 (COVID-19 period) for a shoulder and elbow trauma were retrospectively included and compared to patients admitted in the same period of 2019 (no COVID-19 period).Clinical records of all participants were examined to obtain information regarding age, sex, mechanism of injury, diagnosis. Results During no COVID-19 period, 133 patients were admitted for a shoulder or elbow trauma; in the COVID period, patients were 47(65% less first aid). In the no-COVID and COVID period, patients with shoulder contusion were 60 (14.78% of all) (M:34; F:26) (mean age: 51.8yrs; range: 18-88) and 11 (12.09% of all contusions) (M:7; F:4) (mean age: 43yrs; range: 24-60), respectively. In the no-COVID period, 27 fractures (9.34% of all fractures) involved the shoulder, while 18 fractures (8.69%) were registered in the COVID period. In the no-COVID period,14 elbow fractures were treated (4.8% of all fractures), and 4 in the COVID period. In the no-COVID and COVID periods, 6 (M:5; F:1) (mean age: 42yrs; range 21-64) and 2 (M: 1; F: 1) (mean age: 29.5yrs; range: 24-35 ) patients reported having the feeling of momentary post-traumatic shoulder instability; at the elbow, patients were 0 and 1 (M: 1; F: 0) (age: 56yrs), respectively. Finally, first or recurrent dislocations in the no-COVID period were 10 and 7 in the COVID period.; in the no-COVID period, elbow dislocations were 2, and 3 in the COVID-period. Conclusions During the COVID period, we provided a reduced number of health services, especially for patients with low energy trauma and for those who underwent sports and traffic accidents. However, during the COVID period, elderly subjects remain exposed to shoulder and elbow trauma due to low-energy (domestic) falls. The subsequent hospitalization of these patients has contributed to making more difficult the management of the hospital wards, partly occupied by COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gumina, Stefano; Proietti, Riccardo; Polizzotti, Giuseppi; Carbone, Stefano; Candela, Vittorio","journal":"Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74eb7ff4e9c1cc1a5265c27ff9a86d4111d2f9e5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1058274620304018?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2020.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1058274620304018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID-period","impact of Covid","COVID periods","rapid spreading of COVID","elbow trauma","elbow fractures","methods Patients","mean age","elbow dislocations","yrs","shoulder contusion","Trauma Centre","range","low energy trauma","feeling of momentary post-traumatic shoulder instability","low-energy","Italy","days","recurrent dislocations","elderly subjects","sex","mechanism of injury","reduced number of health services","information","hospital wards","activity","Abstract Background","Clinical records","participants","management","diagnosis","protected area","sports","homes","essential reason","traffic accidents","people","day of restrictions","subsequent hospitalization","Materials","Results","Conclusions","study","aid","contusions"],"language":"en"},

The relatively high mortality of FIP, especially for younger cats from catteries and shelters, should be reason enough to stimulate such intense interest. However, it is the complexity of the disease and the grudging manner in which it yields its secrets that most fascinate researchers. Feline leukemia virus infection was conquered in less than two decades and the mysteries of feline immunodeficiency virus were largely unraveled in several years. After a half century, FIP remains one of the last important infections of cats for which we have no single diagnostic test, no vaccine and no definitive explanations for how virus and host interact to cause disease. How can a ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic enteric coronavirus transform into a highly lethal pathogen? What are the interactions between host and virus that determine both disease form (wet or dry) and outcome (death or resistance)? Why is it so difficult, and perhaps impossible, to develop a vaccine for FIP? What role do genetics play in disease susceptibility? This review will explore research conducted over the last 5 years that attempts to answer these and other questions.

After 30 years of intensive research efforts, the structures and functions underlying their high degree of sequence conservation are not fully elucidated. The long-hydrophobic viral fusion peptide (VFP) sequences are structurally constrained to access three successive states after biogenesis. Firstly, the VFP sequence must fulfill the set of native interactions required for (meta) stable folding within the globular ectodomains of glycoprotein complexes. Secondly, at the onset of the fusion process, they get transferred into the target cell membrane and adopt specific conformations therein. According to commonly accepted mechanistic models, membrane-bound states of the VFP might promote the lipid bilayer remodeling required for virus-cell membrane merger. Finally, at least in some instances, several VFPs co-assemble with transmembrane anchors into membrane integral helical bundles, following a locking movement hypothetically coupled to fusion-pore expansion. Here we review different aspects of the three major states of the VFPs, including the functional assistance by other membrane-transferring glycoprotein regions, and discuss briefly their potential as targets for clinical intervention.","publish_time":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Apell\u00E1niz, Beatriz; Huarte, Nerea; Largo, Eneko; Nieva, Jos\u00E9 L.","journal":"Chemistry and Physics of Lipids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62ea1b52436f5020dfa97ac7f381c697cb291054.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1a1f37a66af97173614a79e180662578c59c56f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4061400.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4061400?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009308414000413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704587/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009308414000413; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.03.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane-bound states","target cell membrane","virus-cell membrane merger","VFP sequence","Fusion peptides","fusion process","membrane integral helical bundles","major states","fusion-pore expansion","successive states","long-hydrophobic viral fusion peptide","VFPs co-","glycoprotein regions","divergent virus families","conserved hydrophobic domains","high degree of sequence conservation","globular ectodomains of glycoprotein complexes","transmembrane anchors","structures","functions","fusogenic activity of glycoproteins","meta","stable folding","locking movement","lipid bilayer remodeling","accepted mechanistic models","years of intensive research efforts","potential","set of native interactions","specific conformations","sequences","functional assistance","targets","clinical intervention","different aspects","instances","biogenesis","onset"],"language":"en"},

Following differentiation, MBCs remain in peripheral circulation after recovery and are poised to secrete antigen-specific antibodies if and when they are re-exposed to their cognate antigen. Consequently, MBCs form the founder population and provide one of the first lines of pathogen-specific defense against reinfection. The role MBCs play is complicated for viruses that are heterologous, such as dengue virus (DENV), which exist as antigenically different serotypes. On second infection with a different serotype, MBCs from initial dengue infection rapidly proliferate and secrete antibodies: many of these MBC derived antibodies will be cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing, while some antibodies may recognize epitopes conserved across serotypes and have the capacity to broadly neutralize 2 or more serotypes. It is also possible that a new population of MBCs and antibodies specific for the second virus serotype need to arise for long-term broader immunity to develop. Methods to interrogate and track memory B cell responses are important for evaluating both natural immunity and vaccine response. However, the low abundance of MBCs for any specific pathogen makes it challenging to interrogate frequency, specificity, and breadth for the pathogen of interest. This review discusses current approaches that have been used to interrogate the memory B cell immune response against viral pathogens in general and DENV specifically. Including strengths, limitations, and future directions. Single-cell approaches could help uncover the DENV specific MBC antibody repertoire, and improved methods for isolating DENV specific monoclonal antibodies from human peripheral blood cells would allow for a functional analysis of the anti-DENV repertoire.","publish_time":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyski, Zoe L.; Messer, William B.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a50c402f6452315b8ee669802c6c96cc993586e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6562360.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244836/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBC","DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibodies specific","specific pathogen","antigen-specific antibodies","isolating DENV specific monoclonal antibodies","specific defense","DENV specific MBC antibody repertoire","new population of MBCs","Memory B-cells","MBC derived antibodies","low abundance of MBCs","role MBCs play","anti-DENV repertoire","memory B cell immune response","immune cells","lines of pathogen","different serotypes","track memory B cell responses","virus serotype","dengue virus","Single-cell approaches","human peripheral blood cells","initial dengue infection","improved methods","potential antibody","peripheral circulation","vaccine response","natural immunity","cognate antigen","founder population","current approaches","long-term broader immunity","mature following host exposure","viral pathogens","functional analysis","weakly neutralizing","viruses","recovery","strengths","limitations","future directions","frequency","specificity","breadth","differentiation","reinfection","review","epitopes","capacity"],"language":"en"},

The GI tract acts as a selective barrier between the tissues of the bird and its luminal environment. This barrier is composed of physical, chemical, immunological, and microbiological components. A wide range of factors associated with diet and infectious disease agents can negatively affect the delicate balance among the components of the chicken gut and, as a result, affect health status and production performance of birds in commercial poultry operations. Phasing out of antibiotic growth promoters from poultry diets in Europe and recent moves toward reduction or removal of these compounds in other parts of the world including North America will likely change the microbial profile of the GI tract environment in commercial poultry. This paper reviews the GI tract from developmental, immunological, and microbial standpoints and then discusses factors that can affect health status of this system. Necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis and their interactions, and possible consequences of antibiotic growth promoter removal from poultry diets with respect to these diseases, are discussed in more detail.","publish_time":"2008-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yegani, M.; Korver, D.

All patients completed patient preference instrument surveys before meeting their radiation oncologist. Survey responses to 10 statements were categorized into three groups (agree, neutral, or disagree), and the association of survey responses by cancer site was tested with chi-squared tests. Results Ninety-nine percent of all patients preferred to be addressed by their first name in encounters with their radiation oncologist. There were significant associations of Item 3 (hand holding) with gender (p = 0.039) and education (p = 0.028). The responses to Item 5, a statement that patients would feel uncomfortable if the radiation oncologist offered to hug them at the end of treatment, was significantly associated with disease site (p \u003C 0.0001). Further analysis was performed for Item 5 and revealed that the male lung cancer patients had a much higher rate of disagreement with Item 5 compared with prostate cancer patients (37% vs. 18%).

METHODS: Data regarding the incidence of rubella between 1990 and 2004 from Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the meteorological variables including daily average temperatures, daily average wind speeds, average precipitations, average relative humidity, average vapor pressures and average low cloud covers between 1986 and 2004 were collected from the Beijing Meteorological Observatory. Descriptive statistics and back-propagation artificial neural network for forecast model\u2019s establishment were adopted for data analysis. RESULTS: The average temperature and relative humidity have a great contribution (100%) to the rubella morbidity. But the combination of other meteorological factors contributed to improve the accuracy of rubella-meteorological forecast models. The forecast accuracy could be improved by 76% through utilizing a combination of meteorological variables spanning from 3 years ago to the present rather than utilizing data from a single year or dating back to more earlier time than 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: There is a close relationship between the incidence of rubella and meteorological variables in current year and previous 3 years.

Moreover, the second infection from infected patients particularly within general hospitals frequently takes places due to improperly hospitalized and/or quarantined patients. Accordingly, it becomes a great concern to accommodate safer ventilation system in general hospital wards against such airborne transmitted viruses. It is also a recent trend that many urban general hospitals are designed and constructed as high-rises. If a virus is transmitted through uncontrolled air movement within a hospital and then infected other patients or healthy visitors, it might be impossible to control the spread of the disease. Thus research has been preceded scrutinizing stack effect on the indoor airborne virus transmission in large hospitals by conducting both the field measurement and numerical analysis according to the outdoor temperature and the releasing vertical points of the tracer gas assumed as a viral contaminant. In the field measurement of a high-rise hospital, the indoor airflow was affected by the stack effect of vertical chute of the building. The numerical simulation was verified by comparing its prediction results and the field measurement data. In result, very high possibility has witnessed that the airborne contaminant emitted from the infected patients in the lower floors could be transported to the higher floors through the airflow driven by the stack effect.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Taesub; Cho, Jinkyun; Kim, Byungseon Sean","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8640c30a96939181b74e35809d7c7985db0f89c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115776.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288013/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S036013231100117X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.04.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013231100117X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected patients","airborne contaminant","quarantined patients","general hospital wards","urban general hospitals","scrutinizing stack effect","airborne transmitted viruses","field measurement data","stack effect of vertical chute","indoor airborne virus transmission","high-rise hospital","large hospitals","indoor airflow","influenza viruses","viral contaminant","viral diseases","numerical analysis","higher floors","lower floors","numerical simulation","releasing vertical points","safer ventilation system","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","SARS","outdoor temperature","tracer gas","prediction results","great concern","uncontrolled air movement","recent trend","high possibility","H1N1","healthy visitors","epidemic","human casualties","building","research","infection","spread","countries","Abstract","places","high-rises"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 112 UP patients in Shanghai, China, were enrolled prospectively and assessed using the FA\u2010RP from October 2016 to March 2018. We examined the test results and their influence on clinical decisions. Furthermore, as a control group, we retrospectively obtained the clinical data of 70 UP patients between October 2014 and March 2016 (before the FA\u2010RP was available). The two patient groups were compared with respect to factors, including general antimicrobial use and defined daily dose (DDD) numbers. RESULTS: Between October 2016 and March 2018, the positive rate obtained using FA\u2010RP for UP was 76.8%. The primary pathogens in adults with UP were Influenza A/B (47.3%, 53/112).

Records of children and adolescents treated at our hospital during 1987\u20132006 with a documented rhinovirus infection were reviewed and compared with patients with other respiratory virus infections. Prospective study included all children \u22651 month of age admitted to pediatric infectious disease ward during an autumn period. Rhinoviruses were detected by reverse transcription\u2010PCR and/or culture, and sequence analysis was used for virus typing. In the retrospective study, the median age of 580 children with rhinovirus infection was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 1.0\u20134.3 years), and 27% had an underlying medical condition. Eighty\u2010four children (16% of in\u2010patients) were treated at pediatric intensive care unit. Twenty\u2010one children (4%) had a hospital\u2010acquired rhinovirus infection. In the prospective study, rhinoviruses were detected in 28% of 163 hospital episodes. Acute wheezing illness was diagnosed in 61% of children with rhinovirus and in 31% of children with respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, or no study virus (P \u003C 0.001). One\u2010half of sequence\u2010analyzed rhinovirus strains belonged to the newly identified C group. In conclusion, rhinovirus infections are a frequent cause of pediatric hospitalizations, and they are common also at the intensive care unit. Acute wheezing is the most frequent manifestation in hospital setting, but the range of clinical presentations is wide.

Fortunately, high-quality columns of every type described in this review are commercially available. Most water-soluble proteins may be eluted from size-exclusion, hydrophobic-interaction, ion-exchange, metal chelate, and bioaffinity columns with ease. When this is the case, high recovery and retention of biological activity are the norm. The exception is reversed-phase chromatography where the organic solvents and acids used in polypeptide elution denature many proteins. When problems do occur, they are generally the result of unique structural features of the protein. Very hydrophobic proteins have presented the biggest problem in that they are difficult to solubilize, particularly with retention of biological activity. It has been found that zwitterionic an non-ionic detergents are the most suitable solubilizing agents, but area has also been used in cases where hydrophobic interacts are not as strong. Unfortunately, there is still an element of trial-and-error in selecting the most suitable solubilizing agent. Heterogeneous glycosylation of proteins also presents a problem. Both neutral and charged monosaccharides can be incorporated into proteins through multiple steps at several sites. Thus, there is the potential in a sample for a large number of glycoprotein species which have the same polypeptide backbone and differing amounts of oligosaccharide. A problem arises when size-exclusion, ion-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, reversed-phase and bioaffinity systems begin to discriminate between these very similar glycoprotein species. Chromatographic peaks can become very load, due to incomplete fractionation, and the polypeptide chain of interest can be associated with multiple peaks. The separation of glycoproteins requires much more study before logical procedures can be suggested for column selection and operation. Aggregated species are another class of proteins which present occasional problems. Multimeric proteins are adsorbed to sorbents by a series of forces, among which are hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic forces. These forces are also responsible for the maintenance of quaternary structure in proteins. When the same forces dominate both retention of protein structure and adsorption at the sorbent surface, the quaternary structure of the protein can be disrupted during elution. Very basic proteins also present a problem in some cases. Columns with residual negative charges, such as a silica-based reversed-phase column, adsorb anionic species so strongly that they are difficult to elute. This is the case with ribosomal and nucleoproteins. The solution is to use exhaustively end-capped columns which diminish electrostatic interactions.","publish_time":"1987-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regnier, Fred E.","journal":"Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical Sciences and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cb38d5d5248644d07e22a33588fd5211fd2067e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378434787800075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0378434787800075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hydrophobic proteins","class of proteins","fractionating proteins","Multimeric proteins","water-soluble proteins","basic proteins","Heterogeneous glycosylation of proteins","hydrophobic-interaction","hydrophobic interactions","retention of protein structure","electrostatic forces","bioaffinity columns","reversed-phase column","polypeptide elution","anionic species","Aggregated species","biggest problem","capped columns","series of forces","high-quality columns","retention of biological activity","similar glycoprotein species","ion-exchange","polypeptide backbone","phase chromatography","maintenance of quaternary structure","size-exclusion","polypeptide chain","large number of glycoprotein species","electrostatic interactions","Chromatographic peaks","multiple peaks","review","cases","suitable solubilizing agents","present occasional problems","column selection","bioaffinity systems","multiple steps","variety of chromatographic techniques","organic solvents","sorbent surface","acids","silica","high recovery","adsorption","metal","non-ionic detergents","hydrogen bonding","study","logical procedures","sample","incomplete fractionation","differing amounts of oligosaccharide","error","load","area","sorbents","result of unique structural features","residual negative charges","type","norm","sites","separation of glycoproteins","element of trial","potential","zwitterionic","nucleoproteins","operation","exception","monosaccharides","ease","solution"],"language":"en"},

Methods and Results: The filter\u2019s physical and viable removal efficiencies (VRE) were investigated with challenges of MS2 bacteriophage aerosols, and the infectivity of MS2 collected on the filter was analysed. To test a proposed inactivation mechanism, media containing thiosulfate or bovine serum albumin (BSA) were put in impingers to quench and consume I(2) released from the filter. In direct plating experiments, treated filters presented significantly higher VREs than did untreated filters; however, collection in excess BSA decreased VRE by half and in thiosulfate the apparent VRE decreased drastically. No significant difference in infectivity of retained viruses on treated and untreated filters was observed at the same environmental condition. Conclusions: Evidence presented herein for competition by dissolved I(2) in infectivity assays supports a mechanism of induced displacement and capture of I(2.) It also requires that dissociation of iodine from the filter and capture of iodine by MS2 aerosols as they pass through the filter be factored in the design of the assessment methodology.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramaiah, Arunachalam; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71de0a44d557989888ac349f10c02c7da7e6c5b5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/acb0e11e5763dbf7588ec435751a2ab705a783f1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.925867","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Asia-Pacific Region"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Asia"],"keyphrases":["nCoV genome evolution","bat-CoV","nCoV genotype","nCoV Spike protein","novel virus","N proteins","emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains","continuous surveillance of CoV strains","universal subunit CoV vaccine","Novel Coronavirus","Structural proteins Spike","epitope binding affinity","high binding affinity","HLA-DR alleles of Asia","human host","human pathogen","vaccine development","bat-SL","immunodominant epitopes","Diverse HLA types","heightened containment effort","CD4 T-cell epitopes","Asia-Pacific Region population","kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome","wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus","HBA","potential candidate peptides","SARS","nucleotide sequence insertion relative","live animal markets","variations","member of betacoronavirus genus","non-synonymous mutations","conserved suggesting differential selection pressures","detailed analysis","indels","globe","Envelope","requirement","outbreak","source","viral adaptation","practical solutions","extensive mutational changes","humans","Membrane","Nucleocapsid","recombination events","city of Wuhan","zoonotic transmission","present study","findings","various countries","prevention efforts","China","CoVZC45"],"language":"en"},

The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) is a method by which the hospital operates when an emergency is declared. Hospitals are often ill equipped to evaluate the strengths and vulnerabilities of their own management systems before the occurrence of an actual disaster. The main objective of this study was to measure the decision making performance according to HICS job actions sheets using tabletop exercises. METHODS: This observational study was conducted between May 1st 2008 and August 31st 2009. Twenty three Iranian hospitals were included. A tabletop exercise was developed for each hospital which in turn was based on the highest probable risk. The job action sheets of the HICS were used as measurements of performance. Each indicator was considered as 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with the HICS. Fair performance was determined as \u003C 40%; intermediate as 41-70%; high as 71-100% of the maximum score of 192. Descriptive statistics, T-test, and Univariate Analysis of Variance were used. RESULTS: None of the participating hospitals had a hospital disaster management plan. The performance according to HICS was intermediate for 83% (n = 19) of the participating hospitals. No hospital had a high level of performance. The performance level for the individual sections was intermediate or fair, except for the logistic and finance sections which demonstrated a higher level of performance. The public hospitals had overall higher performances than university hospitals (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The decision making performance in the Iranian hospitals, as measured during table top exercises and using the indicators proposed by HICS was intermediate to poor. In addition, this study demonstrates that the HICS job action sheets can be used as a template for measuring the hospital response. Simulations can be used to assess preparedness, but the correlation with outcome remains to be studied.","publish_time":"2012-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Djalali, Ahmadreza; Castren, Maaret; Hosseinijenab, Vahid; Khatib, Mahmoud; Ohlen, Gunnar; Kurland, Lisa","journal":"Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67f2ba141bcc1bffbd19f77b1aedde25a0f0022b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3296571.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22309772/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1757-7241-20-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Hospital Incident Command System","HICS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["performance level","participating hospitals","Iranian hospitals","Fair performance","university hospitals","public hospitals","measurements of performance","higher level of performance","high level of performance","HICS job action sheets","HICS job actions sheets","hospital response","hospital disaster management plan","Hospital Incident Command System","decision","tabletop exercises","observational study","actual disaster","higher performances","finance sections","individual sections","management systems","T-test","cornerstones","health care","occurrence","indicators","Univariate Analysis of Variance","preparedness","Descriptive statistics","community","vulnerabilities","turn","BACKGROUND","template","highest probable risk","correlation","outcome","strengths","main objective","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","poor","maximum score","Simulations","face","addition","emergency","accordance"],"language":"en"},

Strict infection control policies were instituted. The 70 patients exposed to the SARS outbreak were isolated from the rest of the hospital. They were triaged, quarantined and cohorted in three open plan wards. Selective isolation was carried out immediately when symptoms and signs suspicious of SARS manifested clinically. The patients\u0027 ages ranged from 21 to 90 years and 56% had surgery before the quarantine. Sixteen patients with unexplained fever during the period of quarantine were isolated, seven of whom were eventually diagnosed with probable SARS. The crude incidence of SARS in our cohort was 10%. The SARS case fatality was 14%. No secondary transmission of the SARS virus within the cohort was observed. Strict infection control, together with appropriate triaging, cohorting and selective isolation, is an effective and practical model of intervention in cohorts exposed to a SARS outbreak. Such a management strategy eases the logistic constraints imposed by demands for large numbers of isolation facilities in the face of a massive outbreak.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Y.-M.; Chow, P.K.H.; Tan, B.-H.; Kurup, A.; Tan, B.K.T.; Tan, F.L.S.; Seldrup, J.; Heng, D.M.K.; Ang, B.; Green, J.; Wong, C.-Y.; Soo, K.-C.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e65b607b21bcb4822a4b28666621b56261176a1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124218.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670104002543; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670104002543","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","SARS virus","probable SARS","signs suspicious of SARS","crude incidence of SARS","SARS case fatality","Selective isolation","massive outbreak","cohort of inpatients","Strict infection control policies","large numbers of isolation facilities","period of quarantine","appropriate triaging","severe acute respiratory syndrome","face","cohorts","practical model of intervention","prospective observational study","logistic constraints","unexplained fever","cohorting","symptoms","management strategy","Abstract","secondary transmission","rest","open plan wards","years","surgery","patients\u0027 ages","hospital"],"language":"en"},

When expressed in isolation, CoV accessory proteins have been shown to interfere with innate antiviral signaling pathways. However, there is limited information on the specific contribution of MERS-CoV accessory protein 4b to the repression of the innate antiviral response in the context of infection. We found that MERS-CoV 4b was required to prevent a robust NF-\u03BAB dependent response during infection. In wild-type virus infected cells, 4b localized to the nucleus, while NF-\u03BAB was retained in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in the absence of 4b or in the presence of cytoplasmic 4b mutants lacking a nuclear localization signal (NLS), NF-\u03BAB was translocated to the nucleus leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This indicates that NF-\u03BAB repression required the nuclear import of 4b mediated by a specific NLS. Interestingly, we also found that both in isolation and during infection, 4b interacted with \u03B1-karyopherin proteins in an NLS-dependent manner. In particular, 4b had a strong preference for binding karyopherin-\u03B14 (KPNA4), which is known to translocate the NF-\u03BAB protein complex into the nucleus. Binding of 4b to KPNA4 during infection inhibited its interaction with NF-\u03BAB-p65 subunit. Thereby we propose a model where 4b outcompetes NF-\u03BAB for KPNA4 binding and translocation into the nucleus as a mechanism of interference with the NF-\u03BAB-mediated innate immune response.","publish_time":"2018-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canton, Javier; Fehr, Anthony R.; Fernandez-Delgado, Ra\u00FAl; Gutierrez-Alvarez, Francisco J.; Sanchez-Aparicio, Maria T.; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Perlman, Stanley; Enjuanes, Luis; Sola, Isabel","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/514e24bfc28e0b5cf4b111d94604e7aa983500c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5800688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29370303/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006838","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["NF-\u03BAB repression","b mutants","NF-\u03BAB protein complex","robust NF-\u03BAB dependent response","nucleus","MERS-CoV","KPNA4 binding","CoV accessory proteins","innate antiviral response","specific NLS","context of infection","innate immune response","specific contribution of MERS","binding karyopherin-\u03B14","NLS-dependent manner","isolation","\u03B1-karyopherin proteins","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","nuclear import","nuclear localization signal","novel human coronavirus","ARDS","strong preference","severe pneumonia","wild-type virus infected cells","translocation","interaction","presence of cytoplasmic","mechanism of interference","expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines","limited information","p65 subunit","case fatality rate","pathways","absence","model","contrast"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of adults admitted with ILI during three influenza seasons (2012\u20132015). Patients were screened for picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza, by PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. We excluded patients coinfected with NIRV and influenza. RESULTS: Among 1421 patients enrolled, influenza virus was detected in 535 (38%), and NIRV in 215 (15%), mostly picornavirus (n = 61), RSV (n = 53), coronavirus 229E (n = 48), and human metapneumovirus (n = 40). In-hospital mortality was 5% (NIRV), 4% (influenza), and 5% (no respiratory virus). As compared to influenza, NIRV were associated with age (median, 73 years vs. 68, P = 0.026), chronic respiratory diseases (53% vs. 45%, P = 0.034), cancer (14% vs. 9%, P = 0.029), and immunosuppressive drugs (21% vs. 14%, P = 0.028), and inversely associated with diabetes (18% vs. 25%, P = 0.038). On multivariable analysis, only chronic respiratory diseases (OR 1.5 [1.1\u20132.0], P = 0.008), and diabetes (OR 0.5 [0.4\u20130.8], P = 0.01) were associated with NIRV detection.

During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk. If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions.

The C-type lectin DC-SIGN and the novel HIV attachment factor CLEC-2 are expressed by platelets and facilitate HIV transmission from platelets to T-cells. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms behind CLEC-2-mediated HIV-1 transmission. RESULTS: Binding studies with soluble proteins indicated that CLEC-2, in contrast to DC-SIGN, does not recognize the viral envelope protein, but a cellular factor expressed on kidney-derived 293T cells. Subsequent analyses revealed that the cellular mucin-like membranous glycoprotein podoplanin, a CLEC-2 ligand, was expressed on 293T cells and incorporated into virions released from these cells. Knock-down of podoplanin in 293T cells by shRNA showed that virion incorporation of podoplanin was required for efficient CLEC-2-dependent HIV-1 interactions with cell lines and platelets. Flow cytometry revealed no evidence for podoplanin expression on viable T-cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Podoplanin was also not detected on HIV-1 infected T-cells. However, apoptotic bystander cells in HIV-1 infected cultures reacted with anti-podoplanin antibodies, and similar results were obtained upon induction of apoptosis in a cell line and in PBMCs suggesting an unexpected link between apoptosis and podoplanin expression. Despite the absence of detectable podoplanin expression, HIV-1 produced in PBMC was transmitted to T-cells in a CLEC-2-dependent manner, indicating that T-cells might express an as yet unidentified CLEC-2 ligand. CONCLUSIONS: Virion incorporation of podoplanin mediates CLEC-2 interactions of HIV-1 derived from 293T cells, while incorporation of a different cellular factor seems to be responsible for CLEC-2-dependent capture of PBMC-derived viruses. Furthermore, evidence was obtained that podoplanin expression is connected to apoptosis, a finding that deserves further investigation.","publish_time":"2010-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaipan, Chawaree; Steffen, Imke; Tsegaye, Theodros Solomon; Bertram, Stephanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Kato, Yukinari; Schm\u00F6kel, Jan; M\u00FCnch, Jan; Simmons, Graham; Gerardy-Schahn, Rita; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5f1fd1f2782b89068dd76bde0acbffc35632895.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2885308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20482880/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-7-47","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Podoplanin"],"organizations":["PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","infected T-cells","viable T-cells","dependent HIV","interactions of HIV","HIV transmission","virion incorporation of podoplanin","mediated HIV","efficient CLEC","unidentified CLEC","apoptotic bystander cells","novel HIV attachment factor CLEC","anti-podoplanin antibodies","membranous glycoprotein podoplanin","absence of detectable podoplanin expression","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","Platelets","different cellular factor","dependent capture of PBMC","cellular mucin","infected cultures","blood of infected individuals","dependent manner","induction of apoptosis","evidence","ligand","derived viruses","similar results","cell lines","viral dissemination","C-type lectin DC-SIGN","viral envelope protein","shRNA","unexpected link","PBMCs","soluble proteins","Binding studies","kidney","Flow cytometry","Subsequent analyses","contrast","CONCLUSIONS","virions","molecular mechanisms","finding","BACKGROUND","investigation","bloodstream","Knock"],"language":"en"},

Oxidative damage has been demonstrated as a pathogenic mechanism in several retinal diseases, and reactive oxygen species are certainly important by-products of ethanol (EtOH) metabolism. Autophagy has been shown to exert a protective effect in different cellular and animal models. Thus, in our model, EtOH treatment increases autophagy flux, in a concentration-dependent manner. Mitochondrial morphology seems to be clearly altered under EtOH exposure, leading to an apparent increase in mitochondrial fission. An increase in 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE), among others were confirmed. The characterization of these structures confirmed their nature as aggresomes. Hence, autophagy seems to have a cytoprotective role in ARPE-19 cells under EtOH damage, by degrading fragmented mitochondria and 4-HNE aggresomes.

We aimed to describe physicians\u0027 perceptions - infectious diseases specialists/medical microbiologists (IDMM) and public health/preventive medicine specialists (PHPMS) - in regards to issues encountered with the pandemics management at the physician level and highlight suggested improvements for future healthcare emergencies. METHODS: In April 2010, Quebec IDMM and PHPMS physicians were invited to anonymously complete a web-based learning needs assessment. The survey included both open-ended and multiple-choice questions. Descriptive statistics were used to report on the frequency distribution of multiple choice responses whereas thematic content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data generated from the survey and help understand respondents\u0027 experience and perceptions with the pandemics. RESULTS: Of the 102 respondents, 85.3% reported difficulties or frustrations in their practice during the pandemic. The thematic analysis revealed two core themes describing the problems experienced in the pandemic management: coordination and resource-related difficulties. Coordination issues included communication, clinical practice guidelines, decision-making, roles and responsibilities, epidemiological investigation, and public health expert advisory committees. Resources issues included laboratory resources, patient management, and vaccination process. CONCLUSION: Together, the quantitative and qualitative data suggest a need for improved coordination, a better definition of roles and responsibilities, increased use of information technologies, merged communications, and transparency in the decisional process. Increased flexibility and less contradiction in clinical practice guidelines from different sources and increased laboratory/clinical capacity were felt critical to the proper management of infectious disease emergencies.","publish_time":"2012-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nhan, Charles; Laprise, R\u00E9jean; Douville-Fradet, Monique; Macdonald, Mary Ellen; Quach, Caroline","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/695f0e7afa181c640a015a3b43d1ae401435107a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3332281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22325707/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Quebec IDMM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic management","Coordination issues","pandemics management","clinical practice guidelines","increased laboratory","patient management","Resources issues","responsibilities","clinical capacity","laboratory resources","Increased flexibility","improved coordination","proper management of infectious disease emergencies","thematic analysis","Quebec IDMM","qualitative data","survey","frustrations","thematic content analysis","physicians\u0027 perceptions - infectious diseases specialists","increased use of information technologies","critical views","PHPMS physicians","vaccination process","decisional process","public health expert advisory committees","better definition of roles","preventive medicine specialists","future healthcare emergencies","resource-related difficulties","different sources","epidemiological investigation","medical microbiologists","decision-making","merged communications","suggested improvements","frequency distribution of multiple choice responses","contradiction","physician level","transparency","involved players","respondents\u0027 experience","help","web-based learning needs assessment","core themes","influenza","problems","regards","multiple-choice questions","H1N1","style","BACKGROUND","Descriptive statistics","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Similar to the diseases in human and other animals, respiratory diseases are primary related to morbidity and are the result of infection with bacteria, viruses, or both. B. bronchiseptica causes serious respiratory diseases in the swine airway track. However, the B. bronchiseptica-specific bacteriophage has diverse advantages such as decreasing antibiotic overuse and possible therapeutic potential against bacteria. OBJECTIVE: The objects of this study were to investigate the therapeutic effect of specific B. bronchiseptica bacteriophages and to identify genes related to bacteriophage signaling utilizing RNA microarrays in swine nasal turbinate cells. METHODS: Bor-BRP-1 phages were applied 24 h prior to B.bronchiseptica infection (1 \u00D7 10(7) cfu/ml) at several concentrations of bacterial infection. Cells were incubated to detect cytokines and 24 h to detect mucin production. And real-time quantitative PCR was performed to examine related genes expression. To determine the change of total gene expression based on B.bronchiseptica and Bor-BRP-1 treatment, we performed RNA sequencing experiments. RESULTS: The results showed that B. bronchiseptica induced increased expression of several inflammatory genes such as IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and Muc1 in a dose-dependent manner. However, Bor-BRP-1 induced reduction of gene expression compared to the B. bronchiseptica induction group. In addition, microarrays detected Bor-BRP-1-altered inflammatory gene expression against B. bronchiseptica, reducing B. bronchiseptica-induced airway inflammation in swine epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the specific bacteriophage has a therapeutic potential to defend against B. bronchiseptica infection by altering inflammatory gene expression profiles.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ga Young; Yu, Hyun Jin; Son, Jee Soo; Park, Sang Joon; Cha, Hee-Jae; Song, Kyoung Seob","journal":"Genes Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4462b7f646558c5a0eee6f02a45313e6585bdf52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034667/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13258-019-00906-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B. bronchiseptica-specific"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bronchiseptica infection","bronchiseptica bacteriophages","bronchiseptica-specific bacteriophage","bronchiseptica-induced airway inflammation","bronchiseptica induction group","related genes expression","Bor-BRP","inflammatory gene expression profiles","induced reduction of gene expression","increased expression","inflammatory genes","change of total gene expression","RESULTS","serious respiratory diseases","swine epithelial cells","swine producers","result of infection","swine airway track","therapeutic effect of specific","swine nasal turbinate cells","possible therapeutic potential","concentrations of bacterial infection","utilizing RNA microarrays","RNA sequencing experiments","antibiotic overuse","pigs","main health concerns","diverse advantages","morbidity","animals","treatment","human","Muc1","study","dose-dependent manner","real-time quantitative PCR","cytokines","viruses","BACKGROUND","addition","mucin production","OBJECTIVE","objects","METHODS","cfu","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Other genes enhance or facilitate viral replication, suggesting that some viruses may have evolved to co-opt IFN effectors for a survival advantage.","publish_time":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schoggins, John W.; Rice, Charles M.","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e483b2a886a8de4df72e62b2d6985ff1de5004ba.json; document_parses/pdf_json/586316e4ba8fae180a835b3898cbcb2b9d7c7c60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3274382.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625711001271; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2011.10.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22328912/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3274382?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625711001271","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISGs","IFN effectors","potent antiviral effectors","system","combinatorial antiviral properties","viruses","numerous antiviral effector functions","interferon-stimulated genes","magnitude of inhibitory activity","step","transcription of hundreds","type","virus life cycle","viral replication","survival advantage","products","mechanisms of action","Recent efforts"],"language":"en"},

The virus has been termed as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Cororavirus-2) and has a genome similar (~82%) to the SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus). An attractive therapeutic target for CoVs is the Mpro (main protease) or 3CLpro (3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) as the enzyme plays a key role in the polyprotein processing and is active in a dimeric form. Further, Mpro is highly conserved among various CoVs as the mutation in Mpro is often lethal to the virus. Thus, drugs targeting Mpro enzyme significantly reduce the risk of mutation-mediated drug resistance and display broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The combinatorial design of peptide-based inhibitors targeting the dimerization of SARS-CoV Mpro represent a potential therapeutic strategy. In this regard, we compiled the literature reports highlighting the effect of mutations and N-terminal deletion of residues of SARS-CoV Mpro on its dimerization and thus, catalytic activity. We believe that the present review will stimulate research in this less explored, yet quite significant area. The effect of the COVID-19 epidemic and the possibility of future CoV outbreaks strongly emphasize the urgent need for the design and development of potent antiviral agents against CoV infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goyal, Bhupesh; Goyal, Deepti","journal":"ACS combinatorial science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402186/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acscombsci.0c00058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV Mpro","CoV infections","Mpro enzyme","dimerization of SARS","SARS coronavirus","possibility of future CoV outbreaks","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","risk of mutation","various CoVs","effect of mutations","present date","main protease","cysteine protease","present review","catalytic activity","pandemic COVID","new coronavirus","combinatorial design of peptide","potential therapeutic strategy","attractive therapeutic target","development of potent antiviral agents","mediated drug resistance","based inhibitors","N-terminal deletion of residues","urgent need","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Cororavirus","global health care emergency","polyprotein processing","literature reports","key role","research","chymotrypsin","CLpro","dimeric form","significant area","regard","drugs","genome similar"],"language":"en"},

When first introduced to a population, a pathogen is often poorly adapted to its new host and must evolve in order to escape extinction. Theoretical arguments and empirical studies have suggested various factors to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not, including host contact structure, pathogen adaptive pathways and mutation rates. Using a multi-type branching process, we model the spread of an introduced pathogen evolving through several strains. Extending previous models, we use a network-based approach to separate host contact patterns from pathogen transmissibility. We also allow for arbitrary adaptive pathways. These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors. Pathogen fitness depends on the host population in which it circulates, and the \u2018riskiest\u2019 contact distribution and adaptive pathway depend on initial transmissibility. Emergence probability is sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of adaptive steps required, with the possibility of large adaptive steps (e.g. simultaneous point mutations or recombination) having a dramatic effect. In most situations, increasing overall mutation probability increases the risk of emergence; however, notable exceptions arise when deleterious mutations are available.","publish_time":"2010-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexander, H.

The role of human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in chronic respiratory disease pathogenesis is recognized. However, no studies have performed molecular sequencing of HAdVs from the lower airways of children with chronic endobronchial suppuration. We thus examined the major HAdV genotypes/species, and relationships to bacterial coinfection, in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and mild bronchiectasis (BE). Methods. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of 245 children with PBB or mild (cylindrical) BE were included in this prospective cohort study. HAdVs were genotyped (when possible) in those whose BAL had HAdV detected (HAdV(\u002B)). Presence of bacterial infection (defined as \u226510(4) colony-forming units/mL) was compared between BAL HAdV(\u002B) and HAdV negative (HAdV(\u2212)) groups. Immune function tests were performed including blood lymphocyte subsets in a random subgroup. Results. Species C HAdVs were identified in 23 of 24 (96%) HAdV(\u002B) children; 13 (57%) were HAdV-1 and 10 (43%) were HAdV-2. An HAdV(\u002B) BAL was significantly associated with bacterial coinfection with Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio [OR], 3.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.38\u20137.75; P = .007) and negatively associated with Staphylococcus aureus infection (P = .03). Young age was related to increased rates of HAdV(\u002B). Blood CD16 and CD56 natural killer cells were significantly more likely to be elevated in those with HAdV (80%) compared with those without (56.1%) (P = .027). Conclusions. HAdV-C is the major HAdV species detected in the lower airways of children with PBB and BE. Younger age appears to be an important risk factor for HAdV(\u002B) of the lower airways and influences the likelihood of bacterial coinfection.","publish_time":"2014-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wurzel, Danielle F.; Mackay, Ian M.; Marchant, Julie M.; Wang, Claire Y.

Methods A follow-up system that includes over 200 IgG4-RD patients across the country during the past ten years. A total of ninety-one patients with IgG4-RD who live in Hubei, China were identified and responded to our survey.

In past years, most of the high-throughput studies on H5N1-host interactions have focused on the host transcriptomic response, at the cellular or the lung tissue level. These studies pointed out that the dynamics and magnitude of the innate immune response and immune cell infiltration is critical to H5N1 pathogenesis. However, viral-host interactions are multidimensional and advances in technologies are creating new possibilities to systematically measure additional levels of \u2018omic data (e.g. proteomic, metabolomic, and RNA profiling) at each temporal and spatial scale (from the single cell to the organism) of the host response. Natural host genetic variation represents another dimension of the host response that determines pathogenesis. Systems biology models of H5N1 disease aim at understanding and predicting pathogenesis through integration of these different dimensions by using intensive computational modeling. In this review, we describe the importance of \u2018omic studies for providing a more comprehensive view of infection and mathematical models that are being developed to integrate these data. This review provides a roadmap for what needs to be done in the future and what computational strategies should be used to build a global model of H5N1 pathogenesis. It is time for systems biology of H5N1 pathogenesis to take center stage as the field moves towards a more comprehensive view of virus-host interactions.","publish_time":"2013-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Josset, Laurence; Go, Jennifer Tisoncik; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d583f4875f2843fb61a287f99720f65c2c48e3cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/deac84b7c01838a4e6f5cd1975e4a0b2a431894a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3834220.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3834220?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.02.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213000725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23499671/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213000725","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host response","H5N1-host interactions","systems biology of H5N1 pathogenesis","host transcriptomic response","viral-host interactions","global model of H5N1 pathogenesis","dynamics of H5N1 influenza virus pathogenesis","Systems biology models of H5N1 disease","Natural host genetic variation","omic studies","innate immune response","comprehensive view of virus","omic data","review","immune cell infiltration","comprehensive view of infection","high-throughput studies","single cell","mathematical models","computational strategies","intensive computational modeling","different dimensions","advances","new possibilities","technologies","metabolomic","additional levels","understanding","RNA profiling","spatial scale","center stage","temporal","field","integration","magnitude","organism","time","lung tissue level","importance","past years","future","emergent property","roadmap"],"language":"en"},

The present standard therapy of pegylated IFN with ribavirin achieves a sustained virologic response in about 50% of patients. However, about half of the CH\u2013C patients are still at risk of fatal liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The other significant event in hepatitis C virus (HCV) research has been the development of a cell culture system. The subgenomic replicon system enables robust HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells. And recently, the complete life cycle of HCV has been achieved using a genotype 2a strain, JFH1. These hallmarks have provided much information about the mechanisms of HCV replication, including information on the host molecules required for the replication. Anti-HCV reagents targeting HCV proteins have been developed, and some of them are now in clinical trials. However, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase frequently causes mutations in the HCV genome, which lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HCV mutants. Some of the cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication have already been discovered using the HCV cell culture system. These host molecules are also candidate targets for antivirals.

Exposure to any given antigen can either improve or worsen the outcome of subsequent lung infections, depending on the immunological history of the host. Thus, an ability to impart transient alterations in the lung environment in anticipation of future insult could provide an important novel therapy for emerging infectious diseases. In this study, we show that nasal administration of virus-like particles (VLPs) before, or immediately after, lethal challenge with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) of mice i) ensures complete recovery from lung infection and near absolute clearance of bacteria within 12 hours of challenge, ii) reduces host response-induced lung tissue damage, iii) promotes recruitment and efficient bacterial clearance by neutrophils and CD11c(\u002B) cells, and iv) protects macrophages from MRSA-induced necrosis. VLP-mediated protection against MRSA relied on innate immunity. Complete recovery occurred in VLP-dosed mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, but not in wild-type mice depleted of either Ly6G(\u002B) or CD11c(\u002B) cells. Early IL-13 production associated with VLP-induced CD11c(\u002B) cells was essential for VLP-induced protection.

METHODS: Online Survey of patients reporting self-diagnosed new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 week follow-up. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-two patents completed bot an initial and follow-up survey. 86.4% reported complete anosmia and a further 11.5% a very severe loss of smell at the time of completing the first survey. At follow-up 1 week later, there is already significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss. 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% already report compete resolution at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell, with reported duration being 1 to over 4 weeks. This is reflected in the overall cumulative improvement rate of 79% patients overall in the interval between surveys. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the growing evidence base supports the likelihood that out cohort have suffered olfactory loss as part of COVID-19 infection. While early recovery rates are encouraging, long term rates will need to be further investigated and there may be an increase in patients with persistent post-viral loss as a result of the pandemic. We further call for loss of sense of smell to be formerly recognised as a marker of COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hopkins, Claire; Surda, Pavol; Whitehead, Emily; Kumar, B.

ARIs are responsible for at least six percent of the world\u0027s disability and death. Viruses are one of the most common agents causing ARIs. Few studies on the viral etiology and clinical characteristics of ARIs have been performed in the northwest region of China, including Gansu Province. METHODS: Clinical and demographic information and throat swabs were collected from 279 patients from January 1st to December 30st, 2011. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed to detect 16 respiratory viral pathogens. RESULTS: 279 patients were admitted for ARIs. The patients aged from 1 month to 12 years, with the median age of 2 years. Of which, 105 (37.6%) were positive for at least one pathogen. A total of 136 respiratory viral pathogens were identified from the 105 patients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected pathogen (26.5%, 36/136), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1\u20133 (22.1%, 30/136), human rhinovirus (HRV) (21.3%, 29/136), human coronavirus (CoV) (10.3%, 14/136) and human adenovirus (HAdV) (9.6%, 13/136). Influenza A (Flu A), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (BoCA) were found 4.4%, 3.7% and 2.2%, respectively. Influenza B (Flu B) and seasonal influenza A H1N1(sH1N1) were not detected. Single-infections were detected in 30.5% (85/279) of cases. RSV was the most common pathogens in patients under 1 year and showed seasonal variation with peaks during winter and spring. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents data on the epidemiology of viral pathogens associated with ARIs among children in Gansu Province, China. RSV is most frequently detected in our study. The findings could serve as a reference for local CDC in drawing up further plans to prevent and control ARIs.","publish_time":"2013-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Guohong; Yu, Deshan; Mao, Naiying; Zhu, Zhen; Zhang, Hui; Jiang, Zhongyi; Li, Hongyu; Zhang, Yan; Shi, Jing; Zhang, Shuang; Wang, Xinhua; Xu, Wenbo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07396bda4a37d13aaf15fdf67d61971549f4162c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3653869.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23691184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza B (Flu B","CDC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["patients","respiratory viral pathogens","control ARIs","clinical characteristics of ARIs","epidemiology of viral pathogens","common pathogens","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","human rhinovirus","human coronavirus","human adenovirus","RSV","detected pathogen","seasonal influenza","viral etiology","Influenza B","Acute respiratory infections","Respiratory syncytial virus","Flu B","Gansu Province","years","leading cause of children","seasonal variation","leading killer","common agents","parainfluenza virus","Single-infections","northwest region of China","demographic information","peaks","percent","throat swabs","data","hMPV","winter","BACKGROUND","reference","world\u0027s disability","death","paper","spring","METHODS","median age","sH1N1","studies","total","Multiplex RT-PCR","local CDC","CONCLUSIONS","PIV","HRV","CoV","HAdV","month","findings","Viruses","RESULTS","cases","study"],"language":"en"},

People in a society may have different opinions about how beneficial the vaccines are and as a consequence some of those individuals decide to vaccinate or not themselves and their relatives. This attitude in face of vaccines has clear consequences in the spread of diseases and their transformation in epidemics. Motivated by this scenario, we study, in a simultaneous way, the changes of opinions about vaccination together with the evolution of a disease. In our model we consider a multiplex network consisting of two layers. One of the layers corresponds to a social network where people share their opinions and influence others opinions. The social model that rules the dynamic is the M-model, which takes into account two different processes that occurs in a society: persuasion and compromise. This two processes are related through a parameter r, r \u003C 1 describes a moderate and committed society, for r \u003E 1 the society tends to have extremist opinions, while r = 1 represents a neutral society. This social network may be of real or virtual contacts. On the other hand, the second layer corresponds to a network of physical contacts where the disease spreading is described by the SIR-Model. In this model the individuals may be in one of the following four states: Susceptible (S), Infected(I), Recovered (R) or Vaccinated (V). A Susceptible individual can: i) get vaccinated, if his opinion in the other layer is totally in favor of the vaccine, ii) get infected, with probability \u03B2 if he is in contact with an infected neighbor. Those I individuals recover after a certain period t(r) = 6. Vaccinated individuals have an extremist positive opinion that does not change. We consider that the vaccine has a certain effectiveness \u03C9 and as a consequence vaccinated nodes can be infected with probability \u03B2(1 \u2212 \u03C9) if they are in contact with an infected neighbor. In this case, if the infection process is successful, the new infected individual changes his opinion from extremist positive to totally against the vaccine. We find that depending on the trend in the opinion of the society, which depends on r, different behaviors in the spread of the epidemic occurs. An epidemic threshold was found, in which below \u03B2* and above \u03C9* the diseases never becomes an epidemic, and it varies with the opinion parameter r.","publish_time":"2017-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alvarez-Zuzek, Lucila G.; La Rocca, Cristian E.; Iglesias, Jos\u00E9 R.; Braunstein, Lidia A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88bd19fa692f29074126e413c1a25770d201ea6a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/554f6f5ca9031e8c6dd85eb32f3ad3e6c222c18f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5679524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121056/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186492; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08428v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parameter r","extremist opinions","different opinions","infected neighbor","Vaccinated individuals","social model","changes of opinions","social network","neutral society","opinion parameter","extremist positive opinion","SIR-Model","new infected individual changes","multiplex network","different processes","probability \u03B2","network of physical contacts","consequence vaccinated nodes","face of vaccines","spread of diseases","certain effectiveness \u03C9","use of vaccines","different behaviors","Susceptible individual","People","layers","epidemic threshold","disease spreading","virtual contacts","certain period t","clear consequences","infection process","states","attitude","transformation","evolution","vaccination","simultaneous way","account","influence","dynamic","case","epidemics","years","controversial issue","persuasion","compromise","favor","trend","hand","relatives","scenario"],"language":"en"},

Fecal changes are frequent and can be signs of infection by digestive pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) and indicators of nutritional and environmental stress. The aim of this study was to define a pathological fecal score for weaning puppies, and to study the impact on that score of two intestinal viruses (canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus). For this, the quality of stools was evaluated on 154 puppies between 4 and 8weeks of age (100 from small breeds and 54 from large breeds). The scoring was performed immediately after a spontaneous defecation based on a 13-point scale (from 1; liquid to 13; dry and hard feces). Fecal samples were frozen for further viral analysis. Each puppy was weighed once a week during the study period. The fecal score regarded as pathological was the highest score associated with a significant reduction in average daily gain (ADG). Fecal samples were checked by semi-quantitative PCR or RT-PCR for canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus identification, respectively. The quality of feces was affected by both age and breed size. In small breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 6 and 7 for puppies at 4\u20135 and 6\u20138weeks of age, respectively. In large breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 5 whatever the age of the puppy. Whereas a high viral load of canine parvovirus type 2 significantly impacted feces quality, no effect was recorded for canine coronavirus. This study provides an objective threshold for evaluation of fecal quality in weaning puppies. It also emphasizes the importance to be given to age and breed size in that evaluation.","publish_time":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grellet, Aur\u00E9lien; Feugier, Alexandre; Chastant-Maillard, Sylvie; Carrez, Bruno; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Casseleux, Gregory; Grandjean, Dominique","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a05d13a1bdfe9e0f2bb00adad0ad7d0cd515bae4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114323.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587712001109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22520179/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.03.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587712001109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathological fecal score","Fecal samples","evaluation of fecal quality","Fecal changes","puppies weaning","weaning puppies","highest score","quality of feces","weeks of age","canine coronavirus identification","ADG","small breeds","large breeds","study period","high viral load of canine parvovirus type","impacted feces quality","quality of stools","hard feces","breed size","puppy","high risk period","RT-PCR","intestinal viruses","viral analysis","semi-quantitative PCR","significant reduction","digestive pathogens","signs of infection","parasites","bacteria","average daily gain","objective threshold","effect","indicators of nutritional","liquid","environmental stress","Abstract","spontaneous defecation","scoring","scale","aim","importance"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis of EDSV has been done by molecular tools since its complete genome sequence was identified. In order to enhance the capabilities of the real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) assay, we aimed to apply the method for direct detection of the EDSV without viral DNA extraction. In order to detect the presence of the EDSV DNA, three pairs of primers were designed, from the conserved region of fiber gene of the EDSV. RESULTS: For our assay, test and control samples were directly used in the reaction mixture in 10-fold serial dilution. The target DNA was amplified at 65 \u00B0C, which yield positive results in a relatively short period of 40\u201345 min. The method reported in this study is highly sensitive as compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and showed no sign of cross-reactivity or false positive results. The RealAmp accomplished specific identification of EDSV among a variety of poultry disease viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The direct RealAmp can be used to detect the presence of EDSV. As our result showed, the RealAmp method could be suitable for the direct detection of other DNA viruses.","publish_time":"2018-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheney, Makay; Kaziyev, Zhambul; Kassenova, Gulmira; Zhao, Lingna; Liu, Wei; Liang, Lin; Li, Gang","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e27de1e584ddc112681240ed674464f524869e3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5811957.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29439721/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1364-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EDSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EDSV DNA","presence of EDSV","diagnosis of EDSV","direct RealAmp","RealAmp method","specific identification of EDSV","DNA viruses","direct detection","target DNA","egg drop syndrome virus","false positive results","assay","viral DNA extraction","order","reduced egg production","reaction mixture","polymerase chain reaction","variety of poultry disease viruses","severe economic losses","breeder","isothermal amplification","real-time fluorescence loop","molecular tools","reactivity","adenovirus","sign of cross","layer flocks","complete genome sequence","PCR","capabilities","conserved region of fiber gene","test","BACKGROUND","fold serial dilution","control samples","pairs of primers","short period","study","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, SARS-CoV M protein is co-localized almost entirely with S, E, or NC protein when co-expressed in the cells. On the other hand, only partial co-localization was observed when S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were co-expressed in the cells. Interactions between SARS-CoV M and other structural proteins but not interactions between S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assay. These results indicate that SARS-CoV M protein, similar to the M proteins of other coronaviruses, plays a pivotal role in virus assembly. The cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of SARS-CoV M protein was responsible for binding to NC protein. Multiple regions of M protein interacted with E and S proteins. A model for the interactions between SARS-CoV M protein and other structural proteins is proposed.

Coronaviruses are capable of infecting multiple species and can evolve rapidly through recombination events. Here, we report the complete genomic sequence analysis of a MERS-CoV strain imported to China from South Korea. The imported virus, provisionally named ChinaGD01, belongs to group 3 in clade B in the whole-genome phylogenetic tree and also has a similar tree topology structure in the open reading frame 1a and -b (ORF1ab) gene segment but clusters with group 5 of clade B in the tree constructed using the S gene. Genetic recombination analysis and lineage-specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) comparison suggest that the imported virus is a recombinant comprising group 3 and group 5 elements. The time-resolved phylogenetic estimation indicates that the recombination event likely occurred in the second half of 2014. Genetic recombination events between group 3 and group 5 of clade B may have implications for the transmissibility of the virus.","publish_time":"2015-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yanqun; Liu, Di; Shi, Weifeng; Lu, Roujian; Wang, Wenling; Zhao, Yanjie; Deng, Yao; Zhou, Weimin; Ren, Hongguang; Wu, Jun; Wang, Yu; Wu, Guizhen; Gao, George F.; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5f6841f61ab1b11599f16043c48b9268be6e134.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4600111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26350969/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01280-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","China","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["group","clade B","imported virus","Genetic recombination analysis","Genetic recombination events","genome phylogenetic tree","MERS-CoV strain","similar tree topology structure","phylogenetic estimation","gene segment","S gene","complete genomic sequence analysis","severe acute respiratory tract infection","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lineage-specific single-nucleotide polymorphism","high fatality rate","SNP","clusters","open reading frame","comparison","capable of infecting multiple species","Coronaviruses","ORF1ab","implications","recombinant","South Korea","humans","transmissibility","ChinaGD01","time","elements","half"],"language":"en"},

In an attempt to develop an efficient in vitro cultivation system for enterotropic MHV strains (MHV-RI and MHV-Y), 8 murine cell lines were inoculated with MHV-RI- or MHV-Y-infected infant mouse intestinal homogenates and screened for the production of cytopathic effects. MHV-RI and MHV-Y consistently produced cytopathic effects only in J774A.1 cells. Both strains produced titers of 106 TCID50/ml in subsequent passages in J774.1 cells. MHV strains -1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S and -DVIM also produced high-titer viral stocks in J774A.1 cells. Therefore J774A.1 cells are the first cells found that support the replication of these 8 enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains. After passage in J774A.1 cells, MHV-RI and MHV-Y could infect previously non-susceptible cell lines (17C1-1, CMT-93, N18 and NCTC 1469), though cytopathic effects were often negligible with MHV-RI. MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI, grew in L2(Percy) cells. Using L2(Percy) cells, an agarose overlay and Giemsa staining, MHV-Y could be quantified by plaque assay. Infant mouse bioassays, plaque assays and cell culture infections were compared for their sensitivity in detecting MHV-Y in infected intestinal homogenates and cell supernatants.","publish_time":"1995-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Compton, S.

The chapter discusses the ways EM is used to identify morphological features of the various stages in the assembly of virus particles, to distinguish immature and mature particles, or to analyze steps involved in the acquisition of lipid membranes by enveloped viruses. In addition, it demonstrates the way immunolabeling allows the quantification of viral components, even in individual virus particles, and comparisons between particles at different locations in the cell or at different stages in viral assembly. Together with the newly developed methods for electron tomography and correlative immunofluorescence studies and EM, huge potential exists to unravel more details about virus assembly in the near future.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pelchen\u2010Matthews, Annegret; Marsh, Mark","journal":"Methods in Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8c47d49c897ea3949bdf2d8c13715cb63a28c87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103132.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091679X06790203; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091679X06790203","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assembly of virus particles","virus assembly","viral assembly","individual virus particles","mature particles","human immunodeficiency viruses","different stages","types of enveloped viruses","chapter","quantification of viral components","analysis of viral interactions","electron tomography","human cytomegalovirus","various stages","different locations","ways EM","way immunolabeling","immunolabeling of cryosections","use of standard transmission electron microscopy","correlative immunofluorescence studies","TEM","simian","comparisons","huge potential","SIV","details","acquisition of lipid membranes","developed methods","beta herpesvirus","morphological features","plastic-embedded material","protocols","HCMV","steps","HIV","primate lentiviruses","near future","Publisher Summary","cells","addition"],"language":"en"},

Protection of mice from lethal intranasal VACV challenge required intranasal immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R in a prime-boost protocol, and correlated with low VACV-induced pathology in the respiratory tract and anti-VACV neutralizing antibody. Mice immunized with PIV5-L1R/B5R showed some disease symptoms following VACV challenge such as loss of weight and hunching, but these symptoms were delayed and less severe than with unimmunized control mice. While immunization with PIV5 expressing B5R alone conferred at least some protection, the most effective immunization included the PIV5 vector expressing L1R alone or in combination with PIV5-B5R. PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors elicited protection from VACV challenge even when CD8\u002B cells were depleted, but not in the case of mice that were defective in B cell production. Mice were protected from VACV challenge out to at least 1.5years after immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors, and showed significant levels of anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential for PIV5-based vectors to provide long lasting protection against complex human respiratory pathogens such as VACV, but also highlight the need to understand mechanisms for the generation of strong immune responses against poorly immunogenic viral proteins.","publish_time":"2011-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clark, Kimberly M.; Johnson, John B.; Kock, Nancy D.; Mizel, Steven B.; Parks, Griffith D.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f65c485fb51ff33c93c29ab25222a22053d6dd1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3177979.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211003485; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.08.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211003485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21885079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VACV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PIV5-B5R","PIV5-L1R","secreted VACV L1R","B5R vectors","PIV5 vector","PIV5-based vectors","Protection of mice","B5R proteins","lethal intranasal VACV challenge","significant levels of anti-VACV","low VACV-induced pathology","lasting protection","intranasal immunization","case of mice","effective immunization","unimmunized control mice","potential","respiratory tract","vaccinia virus","parainfluenza virus","disease symptoms","immunogenic viral proteins","complex human respiratory pathogens","neutralization of intracellular mature","important antigens","IMV","generation of strong immune responses","loss of weight","prime-boost protocol","EEV","mechanisms","antibodies","antibody","infection","CD8","combination","B cell production","years","virions","hunching","need","cells","results"],"language":"en"},

This finding is surprising because coronaviruses bud from a pre-Golgi compartment which is expected to be low in cholesterol compared to the plasma membrane.

In this study, we describe PCT levels overtime and their relationship with bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) critically ill patients with pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in an ICU of a University Hospital. All consecutive COPD patients admitted for pneumonia between September 2005 and September 2006 were included. Respiratory samples were tested for the presence of bacteria and viruses. Procalcitonin was sequentially assessed and patients classified according to the probability of the presence of a bacterial infection. RESULTS: Thirty four patients were included. The PCT levels were assessed in 32/34 patients, median values were: 0.493 \u03BCg/L [IQR, 0.131 to 1.471] at the time of admission, 0.724 \u03BCg/L [IQR, 0.167 to 2.646] at six hours, and 0.557 \u03BCg/L [IQR, 0.123 to 3.4] at 24 hours. The highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 \u03BCg/L in 3/32 (9%) patients and greater than 0.25 \u03BCg/L in 22/32 (69%) patients, suggesting low and high probability of bacterial infection, respectively. Fifteen bacteria and five viruses were detected in 15/34 (44%) patients. Bacteria were not detected in patients with PCTmax levels \u003C 0.1 \u03BCg/L. In contrast, bacteria were detected in 4/7 (57%) patients estimated unlikely to have a bacterial infection by PCT levels (PCTmax \u003E 0.1 and \u003C 0.25 \u03BCg/L). CONCLUSION: Based on these results we suggest that a PCT level cut off \u003E 0.1 \u03BCg/L may be more appropriate than 0.25 \u03BCg/L (previously proposed for non severe lower respiratory tract infection) to predict the probability of a bacterial infection in severe COPD patients with pneumonia.

Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Labiatae) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, etc. The present study was to understand the metabolism of the root of Scutellaria baicalensis (a.k.a. Huangqin in Chinese) in the gastrointestinal tract and the correlation between the metabolites and their respective pharmacological activities. Materials and methods The water extract of the root of Scutellaria baicalensis (WESB) was incubated with simulated gastric and intestinal juices, and human fecal microflora for 24h at 37\u00B0C. The HPLC\u2013DAD analysis was used to monitor the in vitro metabolic process and identify its metabolites by comparing their absorption spectrum and retention time with those of chemical references. The in vitro anticomplementary and antimicrobial activity was evaluated with hemolysis assay, agar disc-diffusion method and MIC value, respectively. Results Main constituents of WESB remain unchanged during the incubation with simulated gastric juice (pH=1.5) and intestinal juice (pH=6.8), whereas four flavones, baicalin, wogonoside, oroxyloside and norwogonoside were metabolized into their respective aglycons by human intestinal bacteria. All four metabolites were demonstrated to have higher anticomplementary and antimicrobial activity than those of WESB. The anticomplementary active metabolites were identified to be baicalein, oroxylin A and norwogonin, among them, norwogonin is the most active compound. Conclusion The presence of intestinal bacteria is demonstrated to play an important role in the gastrointestinal metabolism of WESB, and the pharmacological effects of Scutellaria baicalensis may be dependent on the intestinal bacteria metabolism.","publish_time":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xing, Shihua; Wang, Mengyue; Peng, Ying; Chen, Daofeng; Li, Xiaobo","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/463af8e2b638f43d6617bd9736d36281559f8baf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127269.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874114000063; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114000063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412378/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Georgi"],"organizations":["WESB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intestinal bacteria metabolism","root of Scutellaria baicalensis","gastrointestinal metabolism of WESB","human intestinal bacteria","intestinal juices","Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi","presence of intestinal bacteria","anticomplementary active metabolites","pharmacological effects of Scutellaria baicalensis","gastrointestinal infections","gastrointestinal tract","simulated gastric juice","antimicrobial activity","Main constituents of WESB","norwogonin","higher anticomplementary","respective pharmacological activities","respective aglycons","active compound","human fecal microflora","well-known traditional Chinese medicine","inflammation","agar disc-diffusion method","hemolysis assay","cardiovascular diseases","Labiatae","incubation","water extract","retention time","norwogonoside","Huangqin","MIC value","baicalin","oroxyloside","methods","absorption spectrum","present study","baicalein","correlation","important role","HPLC","flavones","chemical references","Materials","Conclusion","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance","DAD analysis","oroxylin","metabolic process"],"language":"en"},

Breeding is dominated by each pack\u0027s alpha male and female, and both sexes share responsibility for territory defense and pup-rearing. They are also opportunistic predators on domestic livestock and pets. But while dominant adults have been implicated as primary killers, depredation is reduced when coyotes are without pups. Contraception, therefore, may represent a non-lethal solution for conflicts between coyotes and humans. Steroid hormones successfully control fertility in some species, but have been considered contraindicated in wildlife and canids in particular; specific concerns include possible induction of aberrant behavior, or uterine and hematopoietic pathologies. Herein we describe a study examining the physiological effectiveness, health safety, and behavioral consequences following treatment of estrous coyotes with exogenous estrogen. We treated captive adult female coyotes in estrus with 0.01mg/kg estradiol benzoate (EB), either before (n =5) or immediately after ovulation (n =6), then documented reproductive outcome, physiological variables and behavioral responses, during and after treatment. Pregnancy was averted in six females treated after ovulation, suggesting that appropriate timing of treatment proved crucial. A transient suppression of sexual behavior was observed, and in some cases, estrus appeared slightly lengthened. However, neither ovulation nor mating behavior was fully suppressed. Importantly, non-pregnant females (and their mates) displayed diestrous socio-sexual behavior similar to pregnant coyotes (behavioral pseudopregnancy). Furthermore, non-pregnant coyotes did not mate again until the next native breeding season, and we observed no deleterious physiological effects during diestrus or subsequent ovarian cycles.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carlson, Debra A.; Gese, Eric M.","journal":"Animal Reproduction Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c0c45505f453a59c60314c682e0f3d7c9fd9adc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126472.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432009001377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523776/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.05.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378432009001377","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-pregnant coyotes","Abstract Coyotes","treatment of estrous coyotes","ovulation","captive adult female coyotes","non-pregnant females","mating behavior","behavioral consequences","behavioral responses","behavioral pseudopregnancy","physiological variables","physiological effectiveness","transient suppression of sexual behavior","diestrous socio-sexual behavior similar","possible induction of aberrant behavior","deleterious physiological effects","appropriate timing of treatment","non-lethal solution","native breeding season","specific concerns","diestrus","health safety","mates","territory defense","canids","responsibility","sexes","subsequent ovarian cycles","conflicts","reproductive outcome","opportunistic predators","domestic livestock","pets","wildlife","primary killers","pack\u0027s alpha male","Canis latrans","exogenous estrogen","pup-rearing","hematopoietic pathologies","fertility","species","perennial pair-bonds","EB","study","depredation","humans","Steroid hormones","dominant adults","estradiol benzoate","cases","pups","Contraception"],"language":"en"},

Notably, the structures of these proteins reveal both similarities and differences, which are suggestive of independent evolution towards ligand binding. 5\u2032-triphosphates, which are absent from most RNAs in the cytosol of uninfected cells, are thus a marker of virus infection that is targeted by the innate immune system for both induction and execution of the anti-viral response.","publish_time":"2013-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rehwinkel, Jan; Reis e Sousa, Caetano","journal":"Curr Opin Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b2cdea95cd8c0134c69cc5fb592bb113768dd2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185528.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369527413000660; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527413000660; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2013.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23707340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["triphosphate viral RNAs","viral response","anti-viral immunity","anti-viral effect","RNA virus infection","host proteins","marker of virus infection","RNA virus genomes","triphosphates","innate sensor RIG","induction of interferons","interferon-induced IFIT proteins","cytosol of uninfected cells","cytoplasm of infected cells","innate immune system","IFITs","suggestive of independent evolution","execution","ligand binding","similarities","differences","structures"],"language":"en"},

Reverse genetics technology has completely revolutionized the study of these viruses, making it possible to manipulate their genomes and evaluate the direct effects of these changes on their biology and pathogenesis. The most commonly used reverse genetics system is the infectious clone technology. Whilst flavivirus infectious clones provide a powerful tool, their construction as full-length cDNA molecules in bacterial vectors can be problematic, laborious and time consuming, because they are often unstable, contain unwanted induced substitutions and may be toxic for bacteria due to viral protein expression. The incredible technological advances that have been made during the past 30 years, such as the use of PCR or new sequencing methods, have allowed the development of new approaches to improve preexisting systems or elaborate new strategies that overcome these problems.

During approximately 0.5 billion years of evolution, the merlin and ERM family proteins have maintained both sequence and structural conservation to an extraordinary level.

The central feature of interest was the structure of the locus coeruleus complex in the primates, where a central compactly packed core (A6c) of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons was surrounded by a shell of less densely packed (A6d) tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons. This combination of compact and diffuse divisions of the locus coeruleus complex is only found in primates and megachiropterans of all the mammalian species studied to date.

METHODS: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Outbreak highlighted the significance of formal training in IC practical aspects as well as the development and publication of standards. Minor errors in the use of personal protective equipment were identified as sources of contamination of Health Care Workers\u0027 to SARS CoV. Our hospital\u0027s policy mandated that all staff, be certified in IC practices through a competency based educational program. A multi-disciplinary educational module, derived from a SARS specific model used to educate the SARS designated care team; was developed. Essential components included basic IC principles, specimen collection, use of protective clothing, high risk procedures, modified protocols for ventilator management and oxygen/aerosol therapy, transportation and care of equipment and the environment. Competency checklists for each module were developed. Education was customized, depending on the potential risk of exposure. A train the trainer model with direct involvement of the Infection Control Practitioners (ICP)disseminated the program hospital-wide. \u2022 A self-directed learning package including a video demonstration of application and removal of the Personal Protective attire was developed for the physicians. RESULTS: Evaluation of staff satisfaction indicated an average staff satisfaction of 98.3% with the pace and content of the sessions and also increased staff confidence while caring for patients in isolation.

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest model predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with 90.3% accuracy, compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection, having renal and/or neural tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 \u003C R0 \u2264 1) human-to-human transmissibility were the strongest predictors of severe disease. We present a novel, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections. Newly emerging infectious diseases present potentially serious threats to global health. Although studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with the emergence of new human diseases, these do not address why emerging infections vary in the severity of disease they cause, often termed \u2018virulence\u2019. We test whether ecological traits of human viruses can act as predictors of virulence, as suggested by theoretical studies. We conduct the first systematic review of virulence across all currently known human RNA virus species. We adopt a machine learning approach by constructing a random forest, a model that aims to optimally predict an outcome using a specific structure of predictors. Predictions matched literature-assigned ratings for 28 of 31 test set viruses. Our predictive model suggests that higher virulence is associated with infection of multiple organ systems, nervous systems or the renal systems. Higher virulence was also associated with contact-based or airborne transmission, and limited capability to transmit between humans. These risk factors may provide novel starting points for questioning why virulence should evolve and identifying causative mechanisms of virulence. In addition, our work could suggest priority targets for infectious disease surveillance and future public health risk strategies. Comparative analysis using machine learning shows specificity of tissue tropism and transmission biology can act as predictive risk factors for virulence of human RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brierley, Liam; Pedersen, Amy B.; Woolhouse, Mark E.

Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected upon enrolment and then tested with real-time PCR assays for the major viral causes of respiratory illness. Results Sixty children (2.9%) were infected by hMPV: 24 (1.2%) by hMPV A, 14 (0.7%) by hMPV B, 11 (0.5%) by untyped hMPV, and 11 (0.5%) by hMPV and an additional respiratory virus. There were no differences in disease presentation or in clinical or socioeconomic impact in relation to viral genotypes. HMPV viral load was significantly higher in children with lower respiratory tract involvement (p \u003C0.05), hospitalised children (p \u003C0.05), and the prevalence of secondary cases of a similar disease in the household of index cases (p \u003C0.05).

Schematically, effector T cells specific for self-antigens exist normally, but their activity is modulated and prevented by networks of regulatory T cells. As a result of mimicry between molecular components of microorganisms and self-antigens, autoimmune disease can be triggered by specific foreign pathogens which alter the state of activity of the network from suppression to activation. Conversely, by a procedure known as T-cell vaccination, autologous effector T cells re-injected after in vitro stimulation and attenuation may alter the state of the network from an activation to a suppression. Numerous observations are reviewed that support the concept of autoimmune activity in the destruction of non-infected T4 cells. Such activity is presumed to be triggered by an antigen of viral origin, the most likely, but not the only one, being the envelope protein gp120. Based on this hypothesis, a T-cell vaccination procedure against effector T cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in HIV-seropositive patients is proposed, similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases. Its purpose would be to prevent T-cell loss and the onset of immunodeficiency disease in HIV-seropositive patients. Apart from its potential therapeutic value, this procedure will have use as a therapeutic test from which insight will be gained about the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.","publish_time":"1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atlan, H.; Gersten, M.

A study was conducted to estimate the incidence and the burden of self-defined influenza, and to describe healthcare seeking behavior for self-defined influenza during the A(H1N1)2009 pandemic in the French population. METHODS: We conducted a random-based retrospective cross-sectional telephone survey between May 2009 and April 2010 among a random sample of the French population. RESULTS: For the 10 076 people included, 107 episodes of self-defined influenza were reported. The annual incidence of self-defined influenza was estimated at 13 942 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (CI95% 10 947 \u2013 16 961), 62.1% (CI95% 50.5 \u2013 72.5) of cases consulted a physician and 11.3% (CI95% 5.5 - 21.7) used a face mask.

Understanding the structural basis for immunogenicity and immunodominance will allow us to improve vaccine efficacy and broaden the range of vaccine-preventable diseases.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dormitzer, Philip R.; Ulmer, Jeffrey B.; Rappuoli, Rino","journal":"Trends in Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/819d63a71302ab84053f5cb07e97ebd0fa3c773b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18977045/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167779908002473; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779908002473; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.08.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["range of vaccine","vaccine efficacy","Vaccine design","current vaccine antigens","electrostatic surfaces","optimized antigens","structural basis","detailed structural information","targets of protective immunity","rational presentation","High resolution structures","empiricism","antibodies","immunodominance","native macromolecules of pathogens","immunogenicity","preventable diseases","immunologic performance","immunization","architectures","substructures"],"language":"en"},

In this review we describe similarities, both in structural terms and sequence determinants of their TM and juxtamembrane regions. The TM domains are essential not only for anchoring the proteins in membranes but also have functional roles. Both TM segments contain GxxxG motifs that drive TM associations within the lipid bilayer. They also each possess similar sequence motifs, positioned at the membrane interface preceding their TM domains. These domains are known as cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif in gp41 and CRAC-like motif in APP. Moreover, in the cytoplasmic domain of both proteins other \u03B1-helical membranotropic regions with functional implications have been identified.

Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (\u003E50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (\u221252.68%) and CO (\u221230.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahato, Susanta; Pal, Swades; Ghosh, Krishna Gopal","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/432196306423dc81b1fda82255304ec59283b8f5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375105/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139086; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720326036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326036?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Air","NAQI"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["lockdown air quality","air pollution","air quality scenario","lockdown period","nationwide lockdown","lockdown phases","spatial pattern of air quality","aid of air quality data","National Air Quality Index","days of commencing lockdown","pre-lockdown phase","PM2","reduction of PM10","pollution level","pollution source control","concentrations of PM10","NAQI","megacity Delhi","NO2","maximum reduction","said time period","selected pollutants","suitable time interval","pollutant parameters","cities","special reference","Northern parts","regulatory bodies","NH3","O3","pandemic","forced restrictions","SO2","direction","effectual alternative measures","useful supplement","monitoring stations","COVID","environment","India","country","discussions","results","present article","Abstract","improvement","weeks","study","year"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluated the association between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes or renal disease in real-life clinical settings. Methods A clinical database in Hong Kong included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and grouped according to the initial antihypertensive prescription. The associations between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality or combined diabetes and renal mortality, respectively, were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models. Results From 218,047 eligible patients, 33,288 (15.3%) died within five years after their first-ever antihypertensive prescription and among which 1055 patients (0.48%) died of diabetes or renal disease. After adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, service settings, district of residence, medication adherence, and the number of comorbidities, each drug class was similarly likely to be associated with mortality due to diabetes or renal disease [Adjusted Hazard Ratios (AHR) ranged from 0.92 to 1.73, p=0.287\u20130.939] and all-cause mortality (AHR ranged from 0.83 to 1.02) except for beta-blockers (AHR=0.815, 95% C.I. 0.68\u20130.87, p=0.024) when ACEI was used as a reference group in propensity score-adjusted analysis.

In humans, CPS-CQ is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), raising the hypothesis that this might be partially due to CQ. Chloroquine, an established anti-malarial drug, is also well known for its immune modulating properties including improvement of cross-presentation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of CQ during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy in Plasmodium berghei models. METHODS: A number of experiments in selected complimentary P. berghei murine models in Balb/cByJ and C57BL/6j mice was performed. First, the effect of CQ administration on the induction of protection and immune responses by RAS immunization was studied. Next, the effect of CQ on the induction of circumsporozoite (CS) protein-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells by immunization with P. berghei parasites expressing a mutant CS protein was investigated. Finally, a direct comparison of CPS-CQ to CPS with mefloquine (MQ), an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects, was performed. RESULTS: When CQ was co-administered during immunization with graded numbers of RAS, this did not lead to an increase in frequencies of total memory CD8(\u002B) T cells or CS protein-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells. Also parasite-specific cytokine production and protection remained unaltered. Replacement of CQ by MQ for CPS immunization resulted in significantly reduced percentages of IFN\u03B3 producing memory T cells in the liver (p = 0.01), but similar protection. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide evidence for a direct beneficial effect of CQ on the induction of sporozoite-induced immune responses and protection in P. berghei malaria models. Alternatively, the higher efficiency of CPS compared to RAS might be explained by an indirect effect of CQ through limiting blood-stage exposure after immunization or to increased antigen exposure and, therefore, improved breadth of the immune response.

In studies done elsewhere, it is well established that older people, when compared with younger adults, are at greater risk of significant morbidity and mortality from complications arising from influenza. The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the diversity of respiratory viruses associated with ILI cases in adults over 50 years old in Senegal. METHODS: The recruitment period of this study was from January 2009 to December 2011. 232 patients aged 50 years and above presenting ILI cases were enrolled. Nasal-pharyngeal and/or oral pharyngeal swabs were collected from patients. RNA was extracted from 200 \u03BCl of each sample followed by a two-step real-time RT-PCR. The Anyplex\u2122 II RV16 Detection kit was used for viral detection. The kit enabled the simultaneous detection of the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: 150 viruses were detected: influenza viruses (44.7%) and rhinoviruses (26.7%) were the most prevalent. We detected 13 human parainfluenza viruses (8.7%), 7 human respiratory syncytial viruses (4.7%), 6 coronaviruses (4%), 5 human metapneumoviruses (3.3%), 5 human adenoviruses (3.3%) and 1 human bocavirus (0.7%). 14 cases (6%) of dual virus infections and one triple viral detection case were encountered. 56 (56.6%) viruses detected were found in the 50-64 year old age group, 59 (76.6%; P \u003C 0.001) from 65\u201374 year old age group and 35 (62.5%) were detected in the \u226575 year old age group. The viral co-infections were more frequent in the 65-74 age group (9/15). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates a variety of respiratory viruses in the elderly. It also highlights a high prevalence of these viruses in this age group. We speculate from these results that the impact of respiratory viruses other than influenza on the elderly has been considerably underestimated. A more exhaustive study seems necessary in order to provide a more complete picture of the burden of respiratory viruses on morbidity among adults over 50 years old in the sub-Saharan context.","publish_time":"2014-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dia, Ndongo; Richard, Vincent; Kiori, Davy; Cisse, El Hadj Abdoul Khadir; Sarr, Fatoumata Di\u00E8ne; Faye, Abdourahmane; Goudiaby, D\u00E9borah G; Diop, Ousmane M; Niang, Mbayame N","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7f783ce7fc3715b718384a9295bd8afb24b93ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4020602.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa","Senegal"],"keyphrases":["diversity of respiratory viruses","burden of respiratory viruses","variety of respiratory viruses","impact of respiratory viruses","human respiratory syncytial viruses","human parainfluenza viruses","year old age group","years old","human metapneumoviruses","human adenoviruses","human bocavirus","simultaneous detection","pilot study","exhaustive study","elderly people","RV16 Detection kit","triple viral detection case","younger adults","presenting ILI cases","viral co-infections","high prevalence","patients","studies","RESULTS","West Africa","Nasal-pharyngeal","older people","dual virus infections","oral pharyngeal swabs","greater risk of significant morbidity","mortality","order","complete picture","sample","complications","two-step real-time RT-PCR","presence","recruitment period","Anyplex","sub-Saharan context","Senegal","\u03BCl","METHODS","main aim","CONCLUSIONS","RNA","BACKGROUND","rhinoviruses","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Chiew, Calvin J; Lee, Vernon J","journal":"Lancet Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f8a485f1acf987c6fe46621216f436b0e351af6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102636.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30129-8; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920301298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145768/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309920301298","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS","outbreak of COVID","confirmed cases of COVID","enforcement of community quarantine","countries","global deaths","strict enforcement of quarantine","outbreak of coronavirus disease","human transmission","extent of community spread","traditional public health measures","clinical severity","prompt isolation of patients","transmissibility","severe acute respiratory syndrome","terms of infectious period","beginning","syndromic surveillance","Summary","peak incidence","rapid large-scale outbreaks","contacts","months","areas","differences","striking similarities","virus characteristics","matter","countermeasures","Exportations","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In this brief report, we describe the bioinformatic discovery of a new, apparently coding, ORF that overlaps the 5\u0027 end of the polyprotein coding sequence, ORF1a, in the \u002B2 reading frame. The new ORF has a strong coding signature and, in fact, is more conserved at the amino acid level than the overlapping region of ORF1a.

Guidelines in many countries recommend antiviral treatment for older people and individuals with comorbidity at increased risk of complications. However, antivirals are not often prescribed in primary care in Europe, partly because its clinical and cost effectiveness has been insufficiently demonstrated by non-industry funded and pragmatic studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Antivirals for influenza-Like Illness? An rCt of Clinical and Cost effectiveness in primary CarE is a European multinational, multicentre, open-labelled, non-industry funded, pragmatic, adaptive-platform, randomised controlled trial. Initial trial arms will be best usual primary care and best usual primary care plus treatment with oseltamivir for 5 days. We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants \u22651 year presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration \u226472 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, headache and muscle ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include estimating cost-effectiveness, benefits in subgroups according to age (\u003C12, 12\u201364 and \u003E64 years), severity of symptoms at presentation (low, medium and high), comorbidity (yes/no), duration of symptoms (\u226448 hours/\u003E48\u201372 hours), complications (hospital admission and pneumonia), use of additional prescribed medication including antibiotics, use of over-the-counter medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics committee (REC) approval was granted by the NRES Committee South Central (Oxford B) and Clinical Trial Authority (CTA) approval by The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

Patients are frequently treated with antibiotics although ARI are most commonly caused by virus, strengthening the need for improved diagnostic methods. Objectives Detect viral and bacterial RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children aged 6\u201323 months with ARI using nCounter. Study design A custom-designed nCounter probeset containing viral and bacterial targets was tested in NPA of ARI patients. Results Initially, spiked control viral RNAs were detectable in \u22656.25ng input RNA, indicating absence of inhibitors in NPA. nCounter applied to a larger NPA sample (n =61) enabled the multiplex detection of different pathogens: RNA viruses Parainfluenza virus (PIV 1\u20133) and RSV A-B in 21%, Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 5%, Bocavirus (BoV), CoV, Influenza virus (IV) A in 3% and, Rhinovirus (RV) in 2% of samples, respectively. RSV A-B was confirmed by Real Time PCR (86.2\u201396.9% agreement). DNA virus (AV) was detected at RNA level, reflecting viral replication, in 10% of samples. Bacterial transcripts from Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were detected in 77, 69, 26, 8, 3 and 2% of samples, respectively. Conclusion nCounter is robust and sensitive for the simultaneous detection of viral (both RNA and DNA) and bacterial transcripts in NPA with low RNA input (\u003C10ng). This medium-throughput technique will increase our understanding of ARI pathogenesis and may provide an evidence-based approach for the targeted and rational use of antibiotics in pediatric ARI.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukutani, Kiyoshi F.; Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.; Van der Gucht, Winke; Wollants, Elke; Khouri, Ricardo; Dierckx, Tim; Van Ranst, Marc; Houspie, Lieselot; Bouzas, Maiara L.; Oliveira, Juliana R.; Barral, Aldina; Van Weyenbergh, Johan; de Oliveira, Camila I.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae161c98329556419d76f0a33175e1ceae998a20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106536.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215001900; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215001900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["NPA","RSV A-B","Real Time PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial RNA","NPA of ARI patients","RNA level","pediatric ARI","ng input RNA","low RNA input","Bacterial transcripts","RNA viruses Parainfluenza virus","viral replication","DNA virus","samples","simultaneous detection of viral","understanding of ARI pathogenesis","bacterial targets","Conclusion nCounter","larger NPA sample","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","spiked control viral RNAs","custom-designed nCounter","RSV","rational use of antibiotics","multiplex detection of different pathogens","Haemophilus influenzae","Moraxella catarrhalis","Staphylococcus aureus","Abstract Background Acute respiratory tract infections","nasopharyngeal aspirates","significant morbidity","PIV","evidence-based approach","absence of inhibitors","need","BoV","CoV","Results","children","global health burden","improved diagnostic methods","Real Time PCR","hMPV","Bocavirus","medium-throughput technique","Human metapneumovirus","Study","months","Objectives","RV","Rhinovirus","agreement"],"language":"en"},

As such, it has long been targeted in the treatment of hypertension through the use of ACE inhibitors. Although ACE has been studied since the 1950s, only recently have the full range of functions of this enzyme begun to truly be appreciated. ACE homologues have been found in a host of other organisms, and are now known to be conserved in insects. Insect ACE homologues typically share over 30 % amino acid sequence identity with human ACE. Given that insects lack a mammalian type circulatory system, they must have crucial roles in other physiological processes. The first ACE crystal structures were reported during the last decade and have enabled these enzymes to be studied from an entirely different perspective. Here we review many of these key developments and the implications that they have had on our understanding of the diverse functions of these enzymes. Specifically, we consider how structural information is being used in the design of a new generation of ACE inhibitors with increased specificity, and how the structures of ACE homologues are related to their functions. The Anopheles gambiae genome is predicted to code for ten ACE homologues, more than any genome studied so far. We have modelled the active sites of some of these as yet uncharacterised enzymes to try and infer more about their potential roles at the molecular level.","publish_time":"2014-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrison, Charlotte; Acharya, K.

In microbes, proteases are often identified as important virulence factors and as such have been targets for novel drug design. It is emerging that some proteases possess additional non\u2010proteolytic functions that play important roles in host epithelia adhesion, tissue invasion and in modulating immune responses. These additional \u201Cmoonlighting\u201D functions have the potential to obfuscate data interpretation and have implications for therapeutic design. Moonlighting enzymes comprise a subcategory of multifunctional proteins that possess at least two distinct biological functions on a single polypeptide chain. Presently, identifying moonlighting proteins relies heavily on serendipitous empirical data with clues arising from proteins lacking signal peptides that are localised to the cell surface. Here, we describe examples of microbial proteases with additional non\u2010proteolytic functions, including streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, PepO and C5a peptidases, mycoplasmal aminopeptidases, mycobacterial chaperones and viral papain\u2010like proteases. We explore how these non\u2010proteolytic functions contribute to host cell adhesion, modulate the coagulation pathway, assist in non\u2010covalent folding of proteins, participate in cell signalling, and increase substrate repertoire. We conclude by describing how proteomics has aided in moonlighting protein discovery, focusing attention on potential moonlighters in microbial exoproteomes.","publish_time":"2015-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarocki, Veronica M.; Tacchi, Jessica L.; Djordjevic, Steven P.","journal":"Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad4f88e2fe4359bf084a954cc9fa73280e83b1d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167786.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25492846/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201400386","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["moonlighting proteins","additional non\u2010proteolytic functions","Moonlighting enzymes","non\u2010covalent folding of proteins","examples of microbial proteases","distinct biological functions","host cell adhesion","subcategory of multifunctional proteins","cell signalling","moonlighting protein discovery","cell surface","host epithelia adhesion","important roles","potential moonlighters","data interpretation","microbial exoproteomes","therapeutic design","serendipitous empirical data","important virulence factors","novel drug design","C5a peptidases","PepO","streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B","mycoplasmal aminopeptidases","tissue invasion","mycobacterial chaperones","attention","clues","coagulation pathway","viral papain","shape","composition","size","single polypeptide chain","modulating immune responses","hydrolysis of peptide bonds","implications","degradation","signal peptides","substrate repertoire","proteomics","microbes"],"language":"en"},

Over the study period, 248 novel viruses from 24 viral families have been described. Using generalized linear models, at a study level we show the number of host species and viral families tested best explained number of viruses detected. We demonstrate that prevalence varies significantly across viral family, specimen type, and host taxonomy, and calculate mean PCR prevalence by viral family and specimen type across all studies. Using a logistic model, we additionally identify factors most likely to increase viral detection at an individual level for the entire dataset and by viral families with sufficient sample sizes. Our analysis highlights major taxonomic gaps in recent bat viral discovery efforts and identifies ways to improve future viral pathogen detection through the design of more efficient and targeted sample collection and screening approaches.","publish_time":"2016-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Young, Cristin C.

We conducted three rounds of mystery patient drills designed to simulate either influenza-like illness (ILI) or measles at 41 community health centers in New York City from April 2015 through December 2016. Among 50 drills conducted, 49 successfully screened the patient\u2013actor (defined as provision of a mask or referral to the medical team given concern of infection requiring potential isolation), with 35 (70%) drills completing screening without any challenges. In 47 drills, the patient was subsequently isolated (defined as placement in a closed room to limit transmission), with 29 (58%) drills completing isolation without any challenges. Patient\u2013actors simulating ILI were more likely to be masked than those simulating measles (93% vs. 59%, p = 0.007). Median time to screening was 2 min (interquartile range [IQR] 2\u20136 min) and subsequently to isolation was 1 min (IQR 0\u20132 min). Approximately 95% of participants reported the drill was realistic and prepared them to deal with the hazards addressed. Qualitative analysis revealed recurring themes for strengths (e.g., established protocols, effective communication) and areas for improvement (e.g., hand hygiene, explaining isolation rationale).

Hospital outbreak and nosocomial transmission were reported, however, several issues remain on the viral excretion course. Objectives Describe the kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in two infected patients. Study design After the initial diagnosis, blood, urine, rectal and respiratory samples were collected regularly, aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00B0C. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay targeted the UpE and Orf1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome. Results In patient 1, who died of refractory ARDS and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs, as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day. Rectal swabs were negative. Patient 2 also developed multiple-organ failure, but survived, with persisting renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance at 30mL/min) and persistent interstitial syndrome albeit weaned off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen. Tracheal aspirations were positive until the 33rd day, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. All other biological samples were negative. Discussion Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV could be observed for more than one month. The most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine, consistent with a type-1 interferon mediated immunological response impaired in patient 1, but developed by patient 2. These results suggest that infection control precautions must be adequately evaluated in clinical wards and laboratories exposed to MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poissy, J.; Goffard, A.; Parmentier-Decrucq, E.; Favory, R.; Kauv, M.; Kipnis, E.; Mathieu, D.; Guery, B.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b58bbfda258eb6660c773205061af9b10876d95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106432.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073585/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214002650; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214002650","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["Background Middle East"],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","MERS-CoV RNA","MERS-CoV genome","blood samples","urine samples","ill patient","Discussion Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS","biological samples","tracheal swabs","Rectal swabs","rapid renal failure","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","pattern of viral excretion","viral excretion course","day","nasopharyngeal swabs","Results","Abstract Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","persistent interstitial syndrome","persisting renal insufficiency","multiple-organ failure","emerging coronavirus","refractory ARDS","Tracheal aspirations","Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay","UpE","Orf1a regions","initial diagnosis","type","interferon","mechanical ventilation","creatinine clearance","immunological response","kinetics","expression","laboratories","Study design","clinical wards","infected patients","infection control precautions","Hospital outbreak","nosocomial transmission","issues","oxygen","Objectives","month"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these disasters that has caused severe disruptions across the world and in many supply chains, particularly in the healthcare supply chain. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, develops a practical decision support system based on physicians\u0027 knowledge and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in order to help with the demand management in the healthcare supply chain, to reduce stress in the community, to break down the COVID-19 propagation chain, and, generally, to mitigate the epidemic outbreaks for healthcare supply chain disruptions. This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure). Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed approach was measured in the real world using the information from four users and the results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Govindan, Kannan; Mina, Hassan; Alavi, Behrouz","journal":"Transp Res E Logist Transp Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70cc908609a00d06d02d5b09b4fac52534488a00.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554520306189?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382249/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1366554520306189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disasters","healthcare supply chain disruptions","supply chains","propagation chain","severe disruptions","proposed approach","immune system","epidemic outbreaks","COVID","fuzzy inference system","practical decision support system","real world","increasing propagation","divides community residents","physicians\u0027 knowledge","heart problems","diabetes","long-term disruption","groups","order","FIS","effectiveness","communities","demand management","pre-existing diseases","high blood pressure","results","time","information","users","risk level","specific features","accuracy","stress","indicators of age","irreparable losses","play","Coronavirus disease","efficiency","regulations","class","paper","individuals"],"language":"en"},

However, some vaccines produced by conventional means are imperfect in many respects including virulence, safety and efficacy. Moreover, there are no vaccines for some animal diseases. Although genetic engineering has provided new ways of producing effective vaccines, the cost of production for veterinary use is a critical criterion for selecting the method of production and delivery of vaccines. The cost effective production and intrinsic ability to enter cells has made adenovirus vectors a highly efficient tool for delivery of vaccine antigens. Moreover, adenoviruses induce both humoral and cellular immune responses to expressed vaccine antigens. Since nonhuman adenoviruses are species specific, the development of animal specific adenoviruses as vaccine delivery vectors is being evaluated. This review summarizes the work related to the development of bovine adenovirus-3 as a vaccine delivery vehicle in animals, particularly cattle.","publish_time":"2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayalew, Lisanework E.; Kumar, Pankaj; Gaba, Amit; Makadiya, Niraj; Tikoo, Suresh K.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f60c9d00f903457244719182bd27821116dcfa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115382.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498212/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X14016120; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14016120; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.11.055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delivery of vaccines","effective vaccines","use of vaccines","delivery of vaccine antigens","vaccine delivery vectors","vaccine delivery vehicle","cost effective production","development of animal specific adenoviruses","animal diseases","cost of production","animal loss","method of production","nonhuman adenoviruses","development of bovine adenovirus","decreased productivity","species specific","infectious diseases","inexpensive means","conventional means","veterinary use","decreased carcass quality","livestock industry","treatment expenses","respects","heavy economic losses","cellular immune responses","intrinsic ability","critical criterion","new ways","efficient tool","virulence","cells","animals","safety","efficacy","genetic engineering","work","cattle"],"language":"en"},

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods offer significant advantages over the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), since they are more rapid and do not require the sophisticated instruments needed for thermal cycling. We previously described a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, \u2018Strand Invasion Based Amplification\u2019 (SIBA\u00AE), with high analytical sensitivity and specificity, for the detection of DNA. In this study, we describe the development of a variant of the SIBA method, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows one-step reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA by SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions. The RT-SIBA method was found to be more sensitive than PCR for the detection of influenza A and B and could detect 100 copies of influenza RNA within 15 min. The development of RT-SIBA will enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral RNA targets within point-of-care or central laboratory settings.

The objective of this double-blind randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of oral inorganic or organic zinc supplementation as a treatment for neonatal diarrhea in calves. Seventy nine 1 to 8 day old male Holstein calves on a California calf ranch were block randomized to one of 3 treatments within 24h from their first onset of diarrhea. Calves received a daily dose of either a placebo composed of 80mg of zinc-free powder, 381.54mg of zinc methionine (Met) (equivalent to 80mg of zinc), or 99.69mg of zinc oxide (ZO) (equivalent to 80mg of zinc) in 2L of a zinc-free oral rehydration solution (ORS). Calves were treated once daily until normal fecal consistency or for a maximum of 14 days. Upon enrollment and exit, calves were weighed, and blood, feces, and liver biopsies were collected for trace mineral analysis. Fecal samples at enrollment and exit were tested for E. coli K99, Cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus and coronavirus. Pre-treatment liver zinc concentrations for the 71 calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 710.6 (SEM=147.7), 852.3 (SEM=129.6), and 750.7 (SEM=202.9)mg/kg dry weight (DW), respectively. Exit liver zinc concentrations for the calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 728.9 (SEM=182.9), 1141.0 (SEM=423.8), and 636.8 (SEM=81.5)mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Although statistically non-significant, there were clinically important findings identified for each of zinc Met and ZO treatments. Calves treated with zinc Met gained on average 40g/day during a diarrhea episode compared to a weight loss of 67g/day on average in the placebo-treated calves (Power 19.9%). Calves treated with ZO had 1.4 times higher hazard of clinical cure compared to calves in the placebo group (Power 5.3%). Calves that were fecal positive to cryptosporidium spp. at enrollment and treated with zinc Met had higher odds of testing negative at exit compared to placebo calves (Odds Ratio (OR)=16.0). In contrast, calves treated with ZO tended to recover (fecal score=1) one day earlier compared to calves treated with a placebo (8.5 d vs. 9.7 d). The current trial identified clinically important findings that warrant further research to investigate zinc\u0027s therapeutic effect for calf diarrhea.","publish_time":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glover, A.

We aimed to determine the proportion of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) among patients with CAP and HN. Moreover, we wished to investigate the relationship between HN and inflammatory markers, bacterial etiology and prognosis in hospitalized children with CAP. METHODS: We carried out a prospective, observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study. Eligible participants were children from 1 month to 17 years old hospitalized due to CAP from 2012 to 2015. RESULTS: A total of 150 children were analyzed. Forty-five (30%) patients had serum sodium levels of less than 135 mmol/L. Patients with HN had significantly higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers. They also had significantly lower osmolality and urine sodium. They also had longer hospitalizations and more days of fever. Only 16 out of the 45 (35%) patients with HN had confirmed calculated plasma osmolality (\u003C275 mOsm/kg). Only 5 out of 37 (13%) patients with available measurements of plasma osmolality and urine sodium fulfilled the criteria for SIADH. Among the 16 patients with HN and hypo-osmolality, 15 had a fractional sodium excretion (EFNa) levels of less than 1%. We found a significant inverse linear correlation between serum sodium and C-reactive protein, as well as serum sodium and procalcitonin. We found a significant direct correlation between serum sodium and urine sodium. CONCLUSION: HN is a common finding in hospitalized children with CAP. True SIADH is a rare event.

The main role of ACE2 is the degradation of Ang II resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang 1\u20137) which opposes the actions of Ang II. Increased Ang II levels are thought to upregulate ACE2 activity, and in ACE2 deficient mice Ang II levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice, whilst Ang 1\u20137 levels are almost undetectable. Thus, ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS because it opposes the actions of Ang II. Consequently, it has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease where its expression is decreased. Not surprisingly, current therapeutic strategies for ACE2 involve augmenting its expression using ACE2 adenoviruses, recombinant ACE2 or compounds in these diseases thereby affording some organ protection.","publish_time":"2012-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tikellis, Chris; Thomas, M.

It reports observations on 522 patients with confirmed CoViD-19 symptomatology, compared to 40 control subjects. In brief, notable T cytopoenia was recorded by flow cytometry in the CD4\u002B and the CD8\u002B populations, which were significantly yet inversely correlated with remarkably increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Flow cytometry established a progressive increase in the expression of programmed cell death marker-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) as patients (n=14) deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex). Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes. The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed.

MERS-CoV sequences have since been found in a bat and the virus appears to be enzootic among dromedary camels across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa. The majority of human cases have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In humans, the etiologic agent, MERS-CoV, has been detected in severe, mild and influenza-like illness and in those without any obvious signs or symptoms of disease. MERS is often a lower respiratory tract disease associated with fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death among more than a third of those infected. Severe disease is usually found in older males and comorbidities are frequently present in cases of MERS. Compared to SARS, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, is more often observed as severe disease in patients with underlying illnesses and is more often fatal. MERS-CoV has a broader tropism than SARS-CoV, rapidly triggers cellular damage, employs a different receptor and induces a delayed proinflammatory response in cells. Most human cases have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, with a fifth of virus detections reported among healthcare workers. This review sets out what is currently known about MERS and the MERS-CoV, summarises the new phenomenon of crowd-sourced epidemiology and lists some of the many questions that remain unanswered, nearly three years after the first reported case.","publish_time":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mackay, Ian M.; Arden, Katherine E.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00a0ab182dc01b6c2e737dfae585f050dcf9a7a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25656066/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215000465; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215000465; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.01.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula","Africa"],"keyphrases":["cases of MERS","MERS-CoV sequences","SARS-CoV","Severe disease","respiratory failure","lower respiratory tract disease","symptoms of disease","known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome","majority of human cases","acute respiratory distress syndrome","multiorgan failure","infection prevention","healthcare settings","virus detections","healthcare workers","reported case","acute kidney injury","fever","Arabian Peninsula","different receptor","cough","control","new phenomenon of crowd","underlying illnesses","lapses","delayed proinflammatory response","broader tropism","dromedary camels","older males","cellular damage","sourced epidemiology","Jordan","comorbidities","death","pneumonia","novel coronavirus","patients","etiologic agent","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","obvious signs","KSA","parts of Africa","cells","difficulties","years","influenza","humans","Abstract","questions","bat","review"],"language":"en"},

To identify antiviral compounds against Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a model positive stranded RNA virus, we tested acridine derivatives, such as chlorpromazine (CPZ) and quinacrine (QC), which are active against prion-based diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that CPZ and QC compounds inhibited TBSV RNA accumulation in plants and in protoplasts. In vitro assays revealed that the inhibitory effects of these compounds were manifested at different steps of TBSV replication. QC was shown to have an effect on multiple steps, including: (i) inhibition of the selective binding of the p33 replication protein to the viral RNA template, which is required for recruitment of viral RNA for replication; (ii) reduction of minus-strand synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase; and (iii) inhibition of translation of the uncapped TBSV genomic RNA. In contrast, CPZ was shown to inhibit the in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase, likely due to binding of CPZ to intracellular membranes, which are important for RNA virus replication. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Since we found that CPZ was also an effective inhibitor of other plant viruses, including Tobacco mosaic virus and Turnip crinkle virus, it seems likely that CPZ has a broad range of antiviral activity. Thus, these inhibitors constitute effective tools to study similarities in replication strategies of various RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2009-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sasvari, Zsuzsanna; Bach, St\u00E9phane; Blondel, Marc; Nagy, Peter D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8bd14ffe1272be4d4c25d0d6f23f2479c0d1475.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2757906.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19823675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPZ","QC","TBSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TBSV RNA accumulation","Small molecule inhibitors of RNA virus replication","replication process","different steps of TBSV replication","binding of CPZ","replication strategies of various RNA viruses","uncapped TBSV genomic RNA","viral RNA template","recruitment of viral RNA","TBSV replicase","model positive stranded RNA virus","p33 replication protein","antiviral compounds","QC compounds","Tobacco mosaic virus","Turnip crinkle virus","Tomato bushy stunt virus","selected steps","multiple steps","potent antiviral drugs","plant viruses","selective binding","broad range of antiviral activity","effective tools","tombusvirus replicase","effective inhibitor","inhibition of translation","similarities","strand synthesis","acridine derivatives","plants","intracellular membranes","reduction of minus","chlorpromazine","BACKGROUND","prion-based diseases","inhibitory effects","protoplasts","quinacrine","assembly","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","assays","SIGNIFICANCE","CONCLUSION","contrast"],"language":"en"},

PED is not notifiable to the EU or World Organisation for Animal Health listed but it is notifiable at the national level in Finland, France, Ireland and Sweden. PED case reports from seven countries and PED surveillance and monitoring activities in thirteen countries were reported. This information was combined with an extensive literature review to provide an update on global PED occurrence, circulating strains and impact in 2014\u20132015. PED confirmed cases have been reported in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. PED virus (PEDV) sequences originating from EU pig herds indicate that the strains currently in circulation share nearly 100% sequence identity and have greater than 99% sequence identity with the reference INDEL (insertion/deletion) strain USA/OH851/2014. In 2014\u20132015, greater genetic variability has been reported in strains circulating in Asia compared with EU Member States and a non\u2010INDEL strain has been detected in the Ukraine in 2014. Data on impact confirms that mortality is higher in suckling piglets and diarrhoea is observed in all age groups. The reported impact is in agreement with that reported in EFSA AHAW Panel (2014) indicating that the impact of recently reported PED outbreaks in Asia and the USA seems to be more severe than that described in EU countries, although the impact of different PEDV strains is difficult to compare between one country and another, as impact is dependent not only on pathogenicity but also on factors such as biosecurity, herd size, farm management, sanitary status or herd immune status.","publish_time":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"EFSA J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4020dedb5c1616fb4e9cb159581e76f7aa5ee3d5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313572/; https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU","World Organisation for Animal Health","EFSA"],"locations":["France","Ireland","Sweden","North America","South America","Europe","Ukraine","Asia"],"keyphrases":["reported impact","reported PED outbreaks","PED surveillance","PED virus","EU countries","global PED occurrence","PED case reports","impact of different PEDV strains","Asia","non\u2010INDEL strain","EU Member States","EU pig herds","strain USA","watery diarrhoea","sequence identity","herd immune status","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea","herd size","sanitary status","reference INDEL","South America","North America","greater genetic variability","non\u2010zoonotic viral disease of pigs","farm management","Finland","update","deletion","insertion","sequences","France","biosecurity","mortality","World Organisation","Animal Health","monitoring activities","national level","extensive literature review","Ireland","factors","coronavirus","suckling piglets","agreement","Sweden","weight loss","OH851","pathogenicity","Europe","cases","circulation","EFSA AHAW Panel","information","age groups","Data","country","Ukraine"],"language":"en"},

Altered zinc turnover may be also involved in depressed TTA efficiency. Zinc turnover is under the control of zinc-bound metallothioneins (Zn-MTs) synthesis. Thyroid hormones, corticosterone and nutritional zinc affect Zn-MT induction. Zn-MT releases zinc in young-adult age during transient oxidative stress for prompt immune response. In constant oxidative stress (ageing and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy), high liver Zn-MTs, low zinc ion bioavailability and depressed TTA efficiency appear. This last finding suggested that MT might not release zinc during constant oxidative stress leading to impaired TTA efficiency. The aim of this work/study is to clarify the role of Zn-MTs (I\u002BII) in TTA efficiency during development and ageing. The main results are (1) Old and PTU mice display high corticosterone, enhanced liver MTmRNA, low zinc and depressed TTA efficiency restored by zinc supply. Increased survival and no significant increments in basal liver Zn-MTs proteins occur in old and PTU mice after zinc supply. (2) Lot of zinc ions bound with MT in the liver from old mice than young (HPLC). (3) Young-adult Tx mice, evaluated at 15 days from thymectomy, display high MTmRNA and nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune damage restored by zinc supply or by thymus grafts from old zinc-treated mice. (4) Young-adult Tx mice, but evaluated at 40 days from thymectomy, display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune profile with survival similar to normal mice. (5) Stressed (constant dark for 10 days) mice overexpressing MT display low zinc, depressed immunity, reduced thymic cortex, high corticosterone, altered thyroid hormones turnover showing a likeness with old mice. These findings, taken altogether, show that corticosterone is pivotal in MTs induction under stress. MTs bind preferentially zinc ions in constant oxidative stress, but with no release of zinc from MT leading to impaired TTA efficiency. Zinc supply restores the defect because zinc has no interference in affecting pre-existing Zn-MTs protein concentrations in old and PTU mice. Therefore, free zinc ions are available for TTA efficiency after zinc supply. Thymus from old zinc-treated mice induces the same restoring effect when transplanted in Tx recipients. However, Tx mice display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and in nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune profile in the long run. Therefore, Zn-MTs (I\u002BII) are crucial in zinc homeostasis for endocrine\u2013immune efficiency during the entire life assuming a role of potential and novel \u2018biological clock of ageing\u2019.","publish_time":"2002-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mocchegiani, Eugenio; Giacconi, Robertina; Cipriano, Catia; Gasparini, Nazzarena; Orlando, Fiorenza; Stecconi, Rosalia; Muzzioli, Mario; Isani, Gloria; Carpen\u00E8, Emilio","journal":"Mechanisms of Ageing and Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa1bfffec8157c6723203255c0c9486dc1efbd76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127331.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637401004146; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0047637401004146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zinc supply","nutritional zinc","release of zinc","control of zinc","zinc homeostasis","old zinc-treated mice","old mice","Zn-MT releases zinc","MT display low zinc","Altered zinc turnover","free zinc ions","Lot of zinc ions","PTU mice","depressed TTA efficiency","immune efficiency","normal mice","Young-adult Tx mice","low zinc ion bioavailability","impaired TTA efficiency","high liver Zn-MTs","Zn-MT induction","role of Zn","MTs induction","basal liver Zn-MTs proteins","constant oxidative stress","high MTmRNA","depressed thyroid","endocrine","high corticosterone","pre-existing Zn-MTs protein concentrations","young-adult age","young-adult thymectomised","immune profile","enhanced liver MTmRNA","transient oxidative stress","liver regeneration","depressed immunity","immune damage","days","Tx recipients","young propyl-thiouracil","thyroid hormones turnover","thymus absence","thymus axis","thymus grafts","constant dark","prompt immune response","natural normalisation","thymectomy","biological clock of ageing","thymic cortex","survival similar","role of potential","Increased survival","bound metallothioneins","Abstract Thymic atrophy","partial hepatectomy","significant increments","entire life","novel","restoring effect","interference","likeness","experimental hypothyroidism","defect","long run","study","synthesis","development","HPLC","aim","work","main results","findings"],"language":"en"},

The domestic cat, the definitive host species with the largest worldwide population, has become evolutionarily and epidemiologically the most important host of T. gondii.

The aims of this study were to estimate T. gondii seroprevalence in selected domestic cat breeds, and to evaluate whether being of a certain breed is associated with T. gondii seropositivity, when the age and lifestyle of the cat are taken into account. The studied breeds were the Birman, British Shorthair, Burmese, Korat, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ocicat, Persian, and Siamese. Plasma samples were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. gondii with a commercial direct agglutination test at dilution 1:40. The samples were accompanied by owner-completed questionnaires that provided background data on the cats. Overall, 41.12% of the 1121 cats tested seropositive, and the seroprevalence increased with age. The Burmese had the lowest seroprevalence (18.82%) and the Persian had the highest (60.00%). According to the final multivariable logistic regression model, the odds to test seropositive were four to seven times higher in Birmans, Ocicats, Norwegian Forest Cats, and Persians when compared with the Burmese, while older age and receiving raw meat were also risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity. This study showed that T. gondii seroprevalence varies by cat breed and identified being of certain breeds, older age, and receiving raw meat as risk factors for seropositivity.","publish_time":"2017-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Must, K\u00E4rt; Hyt\u00F6nen, Marjo K.; Orro, Toomas; Lohi, Hannes; Jokelainen, Pikka","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/250615c975f713cb3e2b09e7e9718fa2eb095a79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5590984.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gondii seroprevalence","gondii seropositivity","Toxoplasma gondii","gondii infection","selected domestic cat breeds","Burmese","older age","lowest seroprevalence","certain breeds","Norwegian Forest Cats","raw meat","studied breeds","host characteristics","important host","risk factors","study","definitive host species","Plasma samples","commercial direct agglutination test","Korat","Birmans","Ocicats","British Shorthair","widespread zoonotic parasite","final multivariable logistic regression model","odds","largest worldwide population","times higher","presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies","dilution","Persians","background data","previous studies","questionnaires","public health","owner","lifestyle","differences","Siamese","outcome","aims","account"],"language":"en"},

To assess the binase effect on intracellular viral RNA we have selected single stranded negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, influenza virus, and rhinovirus, respectively, which annually cause respiratory illnesses and are characterized by high contagious nature, mutation rate, and antigen variability. We have shown that binase exerts an antiviral effect on both viruses at the same concentration, which does not alter the spectrum of A549 cellular proteins and expression of housekeeping genes. The titers of influenza A (H1N1pdm) virus and human rhinovirus serotype 1A were reduced by 40% and 65%, respectively. A preincubation of influenza virus with binase before infection significantly reduced viral titer after single-cycle replication of the virus. Using influenza A virus mini genome system we showed that binase reduced GFP reporter signaling indicating a binase action on the expression of viral mRNA. Binase reduced the level of H1N1pdm viral NP mRNA accumulation in A549 cells by 20%. Since the viral mRNA is a possible target for binase this agent could be potentially applied in the antiviral therapy against both negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2017-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah Mahmud, Raihan; M\u00FCller, Christin; Romanova, Yulia; Mostafa, Ahmed; Ulyanova, Vera; Pleschka, Stephan; Ilinskaya, Olga","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2028c33a99d25b4388a27d93fa0d4e2fe2563b54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5435908.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/5279065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28546965/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binase action","binase effect","expression of viral mRNA","preincubation of influenza virus","viral titer","intracellular viral RNA","antiviral action","antiviral effect","positive-sense RNA viruses","titers of influenza","antiviral therapy","promising antiviral agent","level of H1N1pdm viral NP mRNA accumulation","virus mini genome system","A549 cells","single-cycle replication","expression of housekeeping genes","human rhinovirus serotype","spectrum of A549 cellular proteins","mutation rate","animal models","infection","high contagious nature","possible target","cell cultures","GFP reporter","antigen variability","Bacillus pumilus ribonuclease","respiratory illnesses","concentration"],"language":"en"},

Demyelinating lesions are associated with infiltrating T lymphocytes, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), and activated resident microglia. Tissue damage is thought to be mediated by T cell produced cytokines and chemokines, which activate microglia and/or BMDM to both strip myelin and produce toxic factors, ultimately damaging axons and promoting disability. However, the relative contributions of BMDM and microglia to demyelinating pathology are unclear, as their identification in MS tissue is difficult due to similar morphology and indistinguishable surface markers when activated. The CD4 T cell-induced autoimmune murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), in which BMDM are essential for demyelination, has revealed pathogenic and repair-promoting phenotypes associated with BMDM and microglia, respectively. Using a murine model of demyelination induced by a gliatropic coronavirus, in which BMDM are redundant for demyelination, we herein characterize gene expression profiles of BMDM versus microglia associated with demyelination. While gene expression in CNS infiltrating BMDM was upregulated early following infection and subsequently sustained, microglia expressed a more dynamic gene profile with extensive mRNA upregulation coinciding with peak demyelination after viral control. This delayed microglia response comprised a highly pro-inflammatory and phagocytic profile. Furthermore, while BMDM exhibited a mixed phenotype of M1 and M2 markers, microglia repressed the vast majority of M2-markers. Overall, these data support a pro-inflammatory and pathogenic role of microglia temporally remote from viral control, whereas BMDM retained their gene expression profile independent of the changing environment. As demyelination is caused by multifactorial insults, our results highlight the plasticity of microglia in responding to distinct inflammatory settings, which may be relevant for MS pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarin, Carine; Dutta, Ranjan; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6acfca277c3e484c1dead20fc58db53b179c33ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6004766.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29942315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","BMDM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasticity of microglia","resident microglia","CNS infiltrating BMDM","gene expression profiles of BMDM","pathogenic role of microglia","delayed microglia response","relative contributions of BMDM","peak demyelination","murine model of demyelination","MS tissue","gene expression profile independent","dynamic gene profile","autoimmune murine model of MS","M2 markers","MS pathogenesis","infiltrating T lymphocytes","chronic inflammatory disease","distinct inflammatory settings","CD4 T cell","phagocytic profile","viral control","indistinguishable surface markers","Tissue damage","Demyelinating lesions","experimental autoimmune encephalitis","vast majority of M2","extensive mRNA upregulation","similar morphology","bone marrow-derived macrophages","central nervous system","mixed phenotype of M1","identification","EAE","changing environment","following infection","toxic factors","strip myelin","results","cytokines","chemokines","pathology","gliatropic coronavirus","repair","phenotypes","multifactorial insults","axons","data","Multiple Sclerosis","axonal loss","disability"],"language":"en"},

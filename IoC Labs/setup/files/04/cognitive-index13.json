The aim of the study was to present how we can describe the epidemiological characteristics of ABRD in France, including risk factor analysis and spatio-temporal pattern investigation. The data were collected by specialized surveyors during the 2001 animal survey conducted by the French Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries, from a representative sample of cattle herds. The health questionnaire concerned farm characteristics, practice of BRD vaccination, presence of ABRD, time of occurrence and number of affected animals for the period November 2000\u2013October 2001. After a descriptive analysis of the syndrome, a space\u2013time scan statistic was performed to detect potential clusters, and a logistic regression model was used for analysis of risk factors. The study sample included 16,581 cattle herds as representative of the 260,000 French herds. The ABRD cumulative incidence at farm level was 9.8%, the cumulative incidence at animal level was 2.1%, the cumulative mortality 0.1% and the lethality proportion 6.5%. ABRD occurred mainly during cold months with an epidemic peak in December. Spatial repartition of the syndrome showed that the whole territory was affected, with a higher number of cases in the north-east region, the main bovine production area in France. Three space\u2013time clusters were identified in the period November 2000\u2013February 2001. ABRD was significantly associated with production type, herd size, and BRD vaccination. Beef herds were less affected than dairy herds, and increased herd size increased the risk of ABRD. The outbreak was clustered in space and time, suggesting a common infectious agent for the epidemic in the detected areas. The influence of production type and herd size on syndrome occurrence highlighted the importance of management practices, human movement and animal density.","publish_time":"2009-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gay, Emilie; Barnouin, Jacques","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/087c7070c1d72138687581d13b33c3844d3d1e83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126910.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.02.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19297044/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587709000427; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587709000427","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABRD","French Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries","BRD"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["risk of ABRD","presence of ABRD","French herds","ABRD cumulative incidence","dairy herds","Beef herds","epidemiological characteristics of ABRD","representative sample of cattle herds","syndrome occurrence","respiratory syndrome","time of occurrence","time clusters","space","increased herd size","animal level","risk factor analysis","analysis of risk factors","France","influence of production type","farm characteristics","time scan statistic","farm level","animal survey","animal density","descriptive analysis","number of affected animals","cumulative mortality","study sample","period","main bovine production area","practice of BRD vaccination","health problem","potential clusters","health questionnaire","French Ministry","epidemic peak","Abstract Acute bovine respiratory disease","various infectious agents","common infectious agent","higher number of cases","north-east region","importance of management practices","human movement","spatio-temporal pattern investigation","Fisheries","logistic regression model","specialized surveyors","Agriculture","cold months","lethality proportion","detected areas","data","Spatial repartition","territory","outbreak","aim"],"language":"en"},

A crucial step in the pathogenesis of invasive meningococcal infections is the adhesion of bloodborne meningococci to both peripheral and brain endothelia, leading to major vascular dysfunction. Initial adhesion of pathogenic strains to endothelial cells relies on meningococcal type IV pili, but the endothelial receptor for bacterial adhesion remains unknown. Here, we report that the immunoglobulin superfamily member CD147 (also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) or Basigin) is a critical host receptor for the meningococcal pilus components PilE and PilV. Interfering with this interaction potently inhibited the primary attachment of meningococci to human endothelial cells in vitro and prevented colonization of vessels in human brain tissue explants ex vivo and in humanized mice in vivo. These findings establish the molecular events by which meningococci target human endothelia, and they open new perspectives for treatment and prevention of meningococcus-induced vascular dysfunctions.

Abstract Acute gastrointestinal tract infections are among the most common infectious diseases. In the present review, the different methods of diagnosing gastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites are examined. Stool culture is the method of choice for diagnosing bacterial intestinal infections; however, infections caused by Clostridium difficile can be diagnosed by detection of toxins A and B in stools, and infections caused by diarrheagenic Escherichia coli by PCR detection of specific virulence factor genes harbored by several E. coli pathotypes. The techniques used to diagnose viral gastrointestinal infections include detection of viral antigens and nucleic acids. Finally, gastrointestinal infections caused by parasites can be diagnosed by testing for trophozoites and cysts of protozoa, or larvae and eggs of helminths in stools by direct microscopic examination, with concentration techniques, or by specific stains.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vila, Jordi; \u00C1lvarez-Mart\u00EDnez, Miriam J.; Buesa, Javier; Castillo, Javier","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6a98aef12d7ec60631f540c806b6d04f2dd4fcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103285.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X09001621; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X09001621","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["harbored by several"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infections caused by Clostridium difficile can be diagnosed by detection of toxins A and","the different methods of diagnosing gastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria","and infections caused by diarrheagenic Escherichia coli by PCR detection of specific virulence factor genes harbored by several","and cysts of protozoa","or by specific stains","can be diagnosed by testing for","diagnose viral gastrointestinal infections include detection of viral antigens and nucleic acids","or larvae and eggs of helminths in stools by direct microscopic examination","the method of choice for diagnosing bacterial intestinal infections","Abstract Acute gastrointestinal tract infections","tracto gastrointestinal","infecciones agudas","infecciones gastrointestinales","In the present review","infecciones bacterianas intestinales","Escherichia coli diarreag\u00E9nicas","diagn\u00F3stico","heces","detecci\u00F3n de ant\u00EDgenos v\u00EDricos","par\u00E1sitos","among the most common infectious","gastroenteritis v\u00EDricas","t\u00E9cnicas utilizadas","however","with concentration","fresco","concentraci\u00F3n","utilizaci\u00F3n","examen microsc\u00F3pico","polimerasa de factores","virulencia espec\u00EDficos","quistes de protozoos","larvas","huevos de helmintos","cadena","enfermedades infecciosas","Finally","presencia de trofozoitos","m\u00E9todo de elecci\u00F3n","tinciones espec\u00EDficas","determinaci\u00F3n","reacci\u00F3n","bacterias","virus","\u00E1cidos nucleicos","enteropatotipos","coprocultivo","toxinas","revisi\u00F3n","examined"],"language":"es"},

Using a panel of RRV mutants lacking the envelope N-linked glycans, we found that MBL deposition onto infected cells was dependent on the E2 glycans. Moreover, the glycan-deficient viruses exhibited reduced disease and tissue damage in a mouse model of RRV-induced myositis compared to wild-type RRV, despite similar viral load and inflammatory infiltrates within the skeletal muscle. Instead, the reduced disease induced by glycan-deficient viruses was linked to decreased MBL deposition and complement activation within inflamed tissues.

We aim to assess the factors associated with changes in the incidence of and indications for AT using population-level data. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study investigated patients who underwent AT between 1997 and 2010 by using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We examined surgical rates and indications by the calendar year as well as age, sex, hospital level, and insured residence areas for the correlating factors. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate of AT was 14.7 per 100,000 individuals during 1997\u20132010. Pediatric (\u003C18 years) patients represented 48.2% of the total AT population. More than 99% of the patients underwent the AT procedures as an inpatient intervention. Longitudinal data demonstrated an increasing trend in the pediatric AT rates from 1997 (4.3/100,000) to 2010 (5.7/100,000) (p = 0.029). In the adult subgroup, a decreasing prevalence of infectious indications (p = 0.014) coincided with an increasing neoplastic indications (p = 0.001). In the pediatric subgroup, the prevalence of obstructive indications increased (p = 0.002). The logistic regression analyses indicated that the significant factors associated with the changing surgical indications for AT were the age in the adult subgroup and hospital level in the pediatric subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a low AT rate in Taiwan than that in other countries. Pediatric AT incidence increased during 1997\u20132010. Although a rising prevalence of obstructive and neoplastic indications was noted, infection remained the most common indications for AT.

Protein-RNA interactions have been thought to be mostly mediated by canonical RNA-binding domains that form stable secondary and tertiary structures. However, a number of pioneering studies over the past decades, together with recent proteome-wide data, have challenged this view, revealing surprising roles for intrinsically disordered protein regions in RNA binding. Here, we discuss how disordered protein regions can mediate protein-RNA interactions, conceptually grouping these regions into RS-rich, RG-rich, and other basic sequences, that can mediate both specific and non-specific interactions with RNA. Disordered regions can also influence RNA metabolism through protein aggregation and hydrogel formation. Importantly, protein-RNA interactions mediated by disordered regions can influence nearly all aspects of co- and post-transcriptional RNA processes and, consequently, their disruption can cause disease. Despite growing interest in disordered protein regions and their roles in RNA biology, their mechanisms of binding, regulation, and physiological consequences remain poorly understood. In the coming years, the study of these unorthodox interactions will yield important insights into RNA regulation in cellular homeostasis and disease.

Hence, diabetic therapies which are both \u201Ccardio-renal\u201D protective seem the logical way forward. In this review, we discuss the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors (DPP4inh), which are glucose-lowering agents used clinically and their role in diabetic kidney disease with specific focus on renoprotection and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease. We highlight the novel pleiotropic effects of DPP4 that make it an attractive additional target to combat the fibrotic and inflammatory pathways in diabetic kidney disease and also discuss the current literature on the cardiovascular safety profile of DPP4inh. Clearly, these observed renoprotective effects will need to be confirmed by clinical trials to determine whether they translate into beneficial effects to patients with diabetes.","publish_time":"2015-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panchapakesan, Usha; Pollock, Carol","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84dfdd13ab7bf0544b5939a86b0c24b9a06e9700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4551869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26379674/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00443","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of diabetic kidney disease","end-stage kidney disease","kidney failure","surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease","diabetic therapies","beneficial effects","cardiovascular safety profile of DPP4inh","novel pleiotropic effects of DPP4","major cause of morbidity","observed renoprotective effects","current literature","cardio-renal","major advances","current best practice","main cause of death","significant proportion of patients","renal replacement therapy","increasing diabetes epidemic","renoprotection","specific focus","inflammatory pathways","role","attractive additional target","dipeptidyl peptidase","understanding","molecular mechanisms","inhibitors","background","logical way","nature","review","agents","glucose","clinical trials"],"language":"en"},

Hence, the current study was designed in sheep to investigate the responses of potent vasoactivators, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and/or nitric oxide (NO) in mononuclear leukocytes of PBMCs and RLOs. The results show that BTV infection of sheep led to enhanced transcription of iNOS in PBMCs and in particular RLOs. The BTV RNAs and/or antigens were readily demonstrable in these mononuclear leukocytes, suggesting the possible role of BTV in iNOS induction. Moreover, upon in vitro infection of PBMCs with BTV-23, iNOS was up-regulated in time-dependent fashion and correlated with increased NO production.

PATIENTS AND METHODS This 8-month prospective study of 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS in Taipei, Taiwan, was conducted from April through December 2003. RESULTS The most common presenting symptoms in our 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS were fever, dyspnea, dizziness, malaise, diarrhea, dry cough, muscle pain, and chills. Lymphopenia and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were the most common initial laboratory findings. Initial chest radiographs revealed various pattern abnormalities and normal results. Five of the 14 patients required mechanical ventilation. The need for mechanical ventilation was associated with bilateral lung involvement on the initial chest radiograph and higher peak levels of LDH and CRP. Clinical severity of disease varied from mild to severe. At 8 months after disease onset, patients with mild or moderate SARS had normal findings or only focal fibrosis on chest high-resolution computed tomography. However, bilateral fibrotic changes remained in the 4 patients who had recovered from severe SARS, 1 of whom had mild restrictive ventilatory impairment. One patient with severe SARS died; she was elderly and had other comorbidities. Five additional patients had reduced diffusing capacity. CONCLUSION The clinical picture of our patients presenting with hospital-acquired SARS revealed atypical pneumonia associated with lymphopenia, elevated serum levels of LDH, rapid clinical deterioration, and lack of response to empirical antibiotic therapy. Substantially elevated levels of LDH and CRP correlated with severe illness requiring mechanical ventilatory support. In those receiving mechanical ventilation, pulmonary function was only mildly reduced at 6 to 8 months after acute illness, consistent with the natural history of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to other causes.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Chi-Huei; Shih, Jen-Fu; Su, Wei-Juin; Perng, Reury-Perng","journal":"Mayo Clinic Proceedings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff07a6f4bac5525f4dfa9ad4b70e04b3c47ec878.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094584.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619611621836; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619611621836","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe SARS","additional patients","moderate SARS","elevated levels of LDH","severe illness","mechanical ventilation","clinical course of hospital","elevated serum levels of LDH","CRP","severe acute respiratory syndrome","clinical characteristics","clinical picture","Clinical severity of disease","higher peak levels of LDH","acute illness","Initial chest radiographs","rapid clinical deterioration","mechanical ventilatory support","elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase","Lymphopenia","normal findings","common initial laboratory findings","normal results","months","mild restrictive ventilatory impairment","natural history of acute respiratory distress syndrome","common presenting symptoms","chest high-resolution computed tomography","disease onset","bilateral lung involvement","bilateral fibrotic changes","focal fibrosis","diarrhea","various pattern abnormalities","lack of response","dry cough","malaise","dizziness","atypical pneumonia","muscle pain","dyspnea","fever","month prospective study","C-reactive protein","empirical antibiotic therapy","METHODS","chills","causes","diffusing capacity","pulmonary function","Taipei","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","Taiwan","need","comorbidities"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: From March 2013 through March 2015 we enrolled 189 newborns (96 term and 93 pre-term) into a prospective, longitudinal study obtaining nose/throat swabs within 7 days of birth, weekly while hospitalized and then monthly to four months after hospital discharge. Taqman array cards (TAC) were used to identify 16 viral respiratory pathogens by real time PCR. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered from electronic medical records and parent interview while hospitalized with interval histories collected at monthly visits. The hospital course of all pre-term infants who underwent late-onset sepsis evaluations was reviewed. RESULTS: Over 119 weeks, we collected 618 nose/throat swabs from at risk pre-term infants in our Level IV regional NICU. Only four infants had viral respiratory infections, all less than 28 weeks gestation at birth. Two infants were symptomatic with the infections recognized by the clinical team. The daily risk of acquiring a respiratory viral infection in pre-term infants in the NICU was significantly lower than in the full term cohort living in the community. Once discharged from the hospital viral respiratory infections were common in all infants. CONCLUSIONS: Viral respiratory infections are infrequent in a NICU with strict infection prevention strategies, and do not appear to cause unrecognized illness.

This contribution provides an overview to the Limits to Growth, linking it especially to the \u201Cplanetary boundaries\u201D of climate change, biodiversity loss and novel entities (including artificial substances and genetically modified organisms).

S1 is one of two protein domains in the spike (S) glycoprotein and is responsible for enteric tropism, sialic acid recognition, and host receptor binding. Although there has been extensive research on the S1 protein of TGEV, little is known about the intracellular role of TGEV-S1. In the present study, we used yeast two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library from porcine intestinal cells to identify proteins that interact with TGEV-S1. Among 120 positive clones from the library, 12 intracellular proteins were identified after sequencing and a BLAST search. These intracellular proteins are involved in protein synthesis and degradation, biological signal transduction, and negative control of signaling pathways. Using a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay and Co-IP, we found that UBXN1 interacts with the S1 protein. Here, we observed that TGEV infection led to increased UBXN1 expression levels during the late phase of infection in IPEC-J2 cells. Inhibition of UBXN1 in IPEC-J2 cells via siRNA interference significantly decreased the viral titer and downregulated the expression of S1. UBXN1 overexpression significantly increased the viral copy number. Additionally, we provided data suggesting that UBXN1 negatively regulates IFN-\u03B2 expression after TGEV infection. Finally, our research indicated that UBXN1 plays a vital role in the process of TGEV infection, making it a candidate target for the development of a novel antiviral method.","publish_time":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Peng; Huang, Shilei; Yang, Zhou; Xie, Luyi; Wang, Kai; Yang, Yang; Ran, Lin; Yu, Qiuhan; Song, Zhenhui","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c48bb15af3fe47ce755d022245d64cc0df2537e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6487014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029162/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0648-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-S1","S1 protein of TGEV","expression of S1","process of TGEV infection","intracellular role of TGEV","UBXN1 overexpression","Inhibition of UBXN1","increased UBXN1 expression levels","intracellular proteins","protein synthesis","protein domains","IPEC-J2 cells","late phase of infection","IFN-\u03B2 expression","porcine intestinal cells","cDNA library","viral titer","enteropathogenic coronavirus","vital role","glutathione-S","extensive research","viral copy number","Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","sialic acid recognition","GST","biological signal transduction","enteric tropism","siRNA interference","pulldown assay","development","high morbidity","negative control","pigs","transferase","glycoprotein","degradation","Co-IP","host receptor binding","hybrid screening","yeast","mortality","sucking piglets","spike","candidate target","novel antiviral method","diarrhea","positive clones","present study","pathways","data","BLAST search"],"language":"en"},

Currently, how EBOV fuses its envelope membrane within an endosomal membrane to cause infection is poorly understood. We successfully measure cell-cell fusion mediated by the EBOV fusion protein, GP, assayed by the transfer of both cytoplasmic and membrane dyes. A small molecule fusion inhibitor, a neutralizing antibody, as well as mutations in EBOV GP known to reduce viral infection, all greatly reduce fusion. By monitoring redistribution of small aqueous dyes between cells and by electrical capacitance measurements, we discovered that EBOV GP-mediated fusion pores do not readily enlarge\u2014a marked difference from the behavior of other viral fusion proteins. EBOV GP must be cleaved by late endosome-resident cathepsins B or L in order to become fusion-competent. Cleavage of cell surface-expressed GP appears to occur in endosomes, as evidenced by the fusion block imposed by cathepsin inhibitors, agents that raise endosomal pH, or an inhibitor of anterograde trafficking. Treating effector cells with a recombinant soluble cathepsin B or thermolysin, which cleaves GP into an active form, increases the extent of fusion, suggesting that a fraction of surface-expressed GP is not cleaved. Whereas the rate of fusion is increased by a brief exposure to acidic pH, fusion does occur at neutral pH. Importantly, the extent of fusion is independent of external pH in experiments in which cathepsin activity is blocked and EBOV GP is cleaved by thermolysin. These results imply that low pH promotes fusion through the well-known pH-dependent activity of cathepsins; fusion induced by cleaved EBOV GP is a process that is fundamentally independent of pH. The cell-cell fusion system has revealed some previously unappreciated features of EBOV entry, which could not be readily elucidated in the context of endosomal entry.","publish_time":"2016-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Markosyan, Ruben M.; Miao, Chunhui; Zheng, Yi-Min; Melikyan, Gregory B.; Liu, Shan-Lu; Cohen, Fredric S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ccf19a7957dd88ddcce92605007ad16f26d28ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4711667.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26730950/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005373","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","EBOV GP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extent of fusion","EBOV fusion protein","fusion block","fusion pores","fusion-competent","rate of fusion","cleaved EBOV GP","cell-cell fusion system","viral fusion proteins","small molecule fusion inhibitor","endosomal pH","independent of pH","low pH","acidic pH","neutral pH","independent of external pH","unappreciated features of EBOV entry","endosomal membrane","well-known pH-dependent activity of cathepsins","Cleavage of cell surface","cathepsin activity","membrane dyes","cathepsin inhibitors","envelope membrane","thermolysin","viral infection","context of endosomal entry","recombinant soluble cathepsin B","effector cells","fraction of surface","late endosome-resident cathepsins B","monitoring redistribution of small aqueous dyes","inhibitor of anterograde trafficking","neutralizing antibody","hemorrhagic fever","behavior","electrical capacitance measurements","order","agents","experiments","brief exposure","process","pathogenic filovirus","humans","transfer","mutations","active form","animals","results","marked difference","Ebola virus","endosomes"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines have greatly improved the therapeutic landscape for treating infectious diseases and have significantly reduced the threat by therapeutic and preventative approaches. Furthermore, the advent of recombinant technologies has greatly facilitated growth within the vaccine realm by mitigating risks such as virulence reversion despite making the production processes more cumbersome. In addition, seroconversion can also be enhanced by recombinant technology through kinetic and nonkinetic approaches, which are discussed herein. Recombinant technologies have greatly improved both amino acid-based vaccines and DNA-based vaccines. A plateau of interest has been reached between 2001 and 2010 for the scientific community with regard to DNA vaccine endeavors. The decrease in interest may likely be attributed to difficulties in improving immunogenic properties associated with DNA vaccines, although there has been research demonstrating improvement and optimization to this end. Despite improvement, to the extent of our knowledge, there are currently no regulatory body-approved DNA vaccines for human use (four vaccines approved for animal use). This article discusses engineering DNA vaccines against infectious diseases while discussing advantages and disadvantages of each, with an emphasis on applications of these DNA vaccines. Statement of Significance This review paper summarizes the state of the engineered/recombinant DNA vaccine field, with a scope entailing \u201CEngineering DNA vaccines against infectious diseases\u201D. We endeavor to emphasize recent advances, recapitulating the current state of the field. In addition to discussing DNA therapeutics that have already been clinically translated, this review also examines current research developments, and the challenges thwarting further progression. Our review covers: recombinant DNA-based subunit vaccines; internalization and processing; enhancing immune protection via adjuvants; manufacturing and engineering DNA; the safety, stability and delivery of DNA vaccines or plasmids; controlling gene expression using plasmid engineering and gene circuits; overcoming immunogenic issues; and commercial successes. We hope that this review will inspire further research in DNA vaccine development.","publish_time":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jihui; Arun Kumar, Shreedevi; Jhan, Yong Yu; Bishop, Corey J.","journal":"Acta Biomaterialia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89da54123ba1ef030869fd671971dd907fc7feae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105045.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.08.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1742706118305002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706118305002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Engineering"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["engineering DNA vaccines","DNA-based vaccines","delivery of DNA vaccines","DNA therapeutics","recombinant DNA-based subunit vaccines","DNA vaccine endeavors","DNA vaccine development","recombinant DNA vaccine field","regulatory body-approved DNA vaccines","amino acid-based vaccines","infectious diseases","Abstract Engineering vaccine-based therapeutics","plasmid engineering","vaccine realm","recombinant technology","advent of recombinant technologies","review paper","current state","current research developments","improvement","addition","gene expression","gene circuits","immunogenic issues","immunogenic properties","human use","nonkinetic approaches","therapeutic landscape","animal use","preventative approaches","processing","internalization","manufacturing","adjuvants","plasmids","safety","stability","immune protection","scope","regard","virulence reversion","scientific community","production processes","risks","challenges","threat","disadvantages","growth","emphasis","article","Statement of Significance","trial formulations","commercial successes","recent advances","optimization","applications","knowledge","extent","difficulties","seroconversion","progression","plateau","decrease"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to illuminate genome characterization, phylogenesis and pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The full length of the PHEV/2008 strain genome was 30,684 bp, with a G \u002B C content of 37.27%. The genome included at a minimum of 11 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) of 211 and 289 nucleotides. The replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which had 4382 and 7094 amino acid residues, respectively, were predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome sequence revealed that PHEV/2008 strain was genetically different from other known PHEV types, which represented a novel genotype (GI-1).

The currently developed programs use the so-called progressive approach to efficiently obtain a constrained alignment of several sequences. However, the kernels of these programs, the dynamic programming algorithms for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, run in \uD835\uDCAA(\u03B3n(2)) memory, where \u03B3 is the number of the constraints and n is the maximum of the lengths of sequences. As a result, such a high memory requirement limits the overall programs to align short sequences~only. Results: We adopt the divide-and-conquer approach to design a memory-efficient algorithm for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, which greatly reduces the memory requirement of the dynamic programming approaches at the expense of a small constant factor in CPU time. This new algorithm consumes only \uD835\uDCAA(\u03B1n) space, where \u03B1 is the sum of the lengths of constraints and usually \u03B1 \u226A n in practical applications. Based on this algorithm, we have developed a memory-efficient tool for multiple sequence alignment with constraints.

In the case of HANA, subunits of the same or very similar molecular weight were inter connected with a disulfide bond(s). Cleavage of the bond(s) can easily be achieved by the addition of 1 mM dithiothreitol with concomitant loss of the biological activities of the glyco-protein. After splitting of the interconnecting bonds, all the HANA protein subunits remained bound on the viral membrane. To observe the cleavage of the interpeptide disulfide bond between the F(1) and F(2) subunits of F glycoprotein, higher concentrations of sulfhydryl compounds were required than were necessary for HANA protein. Splitting of the disulfide bond under either denaturing or non-denaturing conditions failed to release both segments of F protein from the virion. Therefore, F glycoprotein seems to have at least two membrane binding sites, one on F(1) and the other on F(2). On the other hand, the disulfide bond which connects the HA(1) and HA(2) subunits of influenza virus is hardly cleaved under non-denaturing conditions. Addition of 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine HCl, which completely inactivates HA activity, was necessary for the splitting of this disulfide bond by thiol compounds. Interestingly, the HA(1) submit was released from the virion after the cleavage. Thus, unlike F(1) and F(2) of HVJ, the HA(1) subunit seems to have no hydrophobic binding site to the membrane. A model for the arrangement of these subunits on the viral membrane is proposed.","publish_time":"1979-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"OZAWA, Masayuki; ASANO, Akira; OKADA, Yoshio","journal":"J Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2918c465628779002fe87521ab785d87a9d1afe1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzExNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HANA","HVJ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subunits of F glycoprotein","segments of F protein","HANA protein subunits","glycoprotein of HVJ","viral membrane","HA activity","Cleavage","splitting","nature of interpeptide disulfide bonds","subunits of influenza virus","case of HANA","glyco-protein","non-denaturing conditions","membrane binding sites","virion","addition","interconnecting bonds","thiol compounds","Sendai virus","hydrophobic binding site","higher concentrations of sulfhydryl compounds","Aemagglutinin","neura-minidase","fusion","biological activities","concomitant loss","dithiothreitol","presence","guanidine HCl","urea","arrangement","similar molecular weight","model","hand"],"language":"en"},

The review will be restricted to late stage developments in the field of human vaccination.","publish_time":"2002-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moingeon, Philippe; de Taisne, Charles; Almond, Jeffrey","journal":"Br Med Bull","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c03f7971e51a825be6a88d675b1cd05d1c3b527.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzEzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune system","review","immune responses appropriate","categories of delivery systems","antigen vectors","synthetic vectors","development of new delivery systems","general goal","live attenuated micro-organisms","presenting target antigens","optimal methods","manner","late stage developments","particular features","treatment","field of human vaccination","protection","vaccines","natural infections","novel devices","intense research activity","example","vaccine administration","different approaches","formulations","adjuvants","specific disease","article"],"language":"en"},

However, the respective contributions of various infected organs, and within these of pDCs, conventional dendritic cells and other cells, to the systemic production of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 or other innate cytokines during viral infections in vivo is largely unknown. Whether a specialization of pDC subsets in the production of different patterns of innate cytokines exists in vivo in response to a viral infection has not been investigated. Here, by analyzing for the first time directly ex vivo, at the single-cell level, the simultaneous production of up to three cytokines in pDCs isolated from MCMV-infected mice, we show that (i) pDCs are the quasi-exclusive source of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, early during MCMV infection, in two immunocompetent mouse lines and with two viral strains, (ii) pDC activation for IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 production is organ specific and (iii) a significant proportion of pDCs simultaneously produce IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1 and IL-12, although TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 appear more often co-expressed with one another than each of them with IL-12. Altogether, these results show a broad and non-redundant role of pDCs in early innate detection of, and defense against, viral infection. The data also show differences in the responsiveness of pDCs from different tissues and suggest distinct molecular requirements for pDC production of various cytokines. These observations must be taken into account when designing new antiviral vaccination strategies aimed at harnessing pDC responses.","publish_time":"2007-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zucchini, Nicolas; Bessou, Gilles; Robbins, Scott H.; Chasson, Lionel; Raper, Anna; Crocker, Paul R.; Dalod, Marc","journal":"Int Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b3dec242ce978d217be86c903ca4eef94a6cbd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110020.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzEzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1","TNF-\u03B1","\u03B2 production","systemic production of IFN","responsiveness of pDCs","pDC production of various cytokines","simultaneous production","production of different patterns of innate cytokines","important source of IFN","significant proportion of pDCs","IL","MCMV infection","non-redundant role of pDCs","pDC activation","quasi-exclusive source of IFN","viral strains","viral infections","harnessing pDC responses","specialization of pDC subsets","early innate detection","conventional dendritic cells","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells","MCMV-infected mice","different tissues","respective contributions of various infected organs","distinct molecular requirements","new antiviral vaccination strategies","immunocompetent mouse lines","account","tumor necrosis factor","defense","organ specific","variety of viruses","single-cell level","murine cytomegalovirus","results","differences","data","observations","time"],"language":"en"},

The procoagulant tissue factor (TF) is thought to play a role in the coagulation disorders that characterize filoviral infections. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenesis of lethal infection with the Angola strain of Marburg virus (MARV-Ang) in rhesus macaques and tested the efficacy of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), an inhibitor of TF/factor VIIa, as a potential treatment. Methods. Twelve rhesus macaques were challenged with a high dose (1000 pfu) of MARV-Ang. Six macaques were treated with rNAPc2, and 6 macaques served as control animals. Results. All 6 control animals succumbed to MARV-Ang challenge by day 8 (mean, 7.3 days), whereas 5 of 6 rNAPc2-treated animals died on day 9 and 1 rNAPc2-treated animal survived. The disease course for MARVAng infection appeared to progress more rapidly in rhesus macaques than has been previously reported for other strains of MARV. In contrast to Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in macaques, up-regulation of TF was not as striking, and deposition of fibrin was a less prominent pathologic feature of disease in these animals. Conclusions. These data show that the pathogenicity of MARV-Ang infection appears to be consistent with the apparent increased human virulence attributed to this strain. The apparent reduced efficacy of rNAPc2 against MARV-Ang infection, compared with its efficacy against EBOV infection, appears to be associated with differences in TF induction and fibrin deposition.","publish_time":"2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geisbert, Thomas W.; Daddario-DiCaprio, Kathleen M.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Young, Howard A.; Formenty, Pierre; Fritz, Elizabeth A.; Larsen, Tom; Hensley, Lisa E.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ef5b4e66ee425de6c47c148d6609604b6e75a4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TF"],"locations":["Angola"],"keyphrases":["MARV-Ang infection","rhesus macaques","EBOV infection","rNAPc2-treated animals","MARV-Ang challenge","pathogenicity of MARV","strains of MARV","MARVAng infection","control animals","apparent reduced efficacy of rNAPc2","pathogenesis of lethal infection","inhibitor of TF","TF induction","regulation of TF","deposition of fibrin","fibrin deposition","Angola strain of Marburg virus","Ebola virus","factor VIIa","disease course","efficacy of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2","procoagulant tissue factor","apparent increased human virulence","prominent pathologic feature of disease","coagulation disorders","mean","differences","high dose","filoviral infections","potential treatment","contrast","pfu","role","days","data","study","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Overall, the polymorphisms affected mRNA expression only weakly. Carriers of a distinct ERCC1 haplotype (CC) showed, however, significantly lower expression values than non-carriers ( P = 0.001). Applying logistic regression, we found that CC haplotype carriers had a 1.69-fold increased odds ratio (95% confidence interval: 1.06\u20132.71) for reduced ERCC1 mRNA levels. This low ERCC1 expression might be associated with reduced DNA repair and better therapy response. In summary, the association we have found between ERCC1 genotype and mRNA expression supports recent clinical observations that genetic variation in ERCC1 can affect treatment outcome and prognosis. Our study further revealed a modulating effect by nutritional factors.","publish_time":"2008-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woelfelschneider, Andreas; Popanda, Odilia; Lilla, Carmen; Linseisen, Jakob; Mayer, Claudia; Celebi, Oktay; Debus, J\u00FCrgen; Bartsch, Helmut; Chang-Claude, Jenny; Schmezer, Peter","journal":"Carcinogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/286667285e86138c9bfe50d30d9f91b861c8867f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110227.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzIyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mRNA expression","low ERCC1 expression","ERCC1 genotype","reduced ERCC1 mRNA levels","affect mRNA levels of ERCC1","ERCC1 rs11615 T","ERCC1 rs3212986 C","distinct ERCC1 haplotype","expression of DNA repair","lower expression values","genetic variation","CC haplotype carriers","phenotypic impact of genetic variants","MDM2 rs2279744 T","reduced DNA repair","TP53 rs17878362","non-carriers","therapy outcome","polymorphisms","plasma levels of \u03B2","coefficients of variation","lifestyle factors","treatment outcome","nutritional factors","better therapy response","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","reverse transcription","recent clinical observations","prostate cancer patients","tumor suppressor genes","messenger RNA","molecular markers","primary blood lymphocytes","rationale","increased odds ratio","modulating effect","p53PIN3","carotene","Considerable interindividual differences","confidence interval","use","risk prediction","association","prognosis","logistic regression","study","lutein","summary","canthaxanthin"],"language":"en"},

Avian H5N1 influenza A virus is an emerging pathogen with the potential to cause substantial human morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the ability of currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccine to confer cross-protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in mice. Methods. BALB/c mice were inoculated 3 times, either intranasally or subcutaneously, with the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine licensed in Japan for the 2005\u20132006 season. The vaccine included A/NewCaledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/NewYork/55/2004 (H3N2), and B/Shanghai/361/2002 viral strains and was administered together with poly(I):poly(C(12)U) (Ampligen) as an adjuvant. At 14 days after the final inoculation, the inoculated mice were challenged with either the A/HongKong/483/97, the A/Vietnam/1194/04, or the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain of H5N1 influenza virus. Results. Compared with noninoculated mice, those inoculated intranasally manifested cross-reactivity of mucosal IgA and serum IgG with H5N1 virus, as well as both a reduced H5N1 virus titer in nasal-wash samples and increased survival, after challenge with H5N1 virus. Subcutaneous inoculation did not induce a cross-reactive IgA response and did not afford protection against H5N1 viral infection. Conclusions. Intranasal inoculation with annual influenza vaccine plus the Toll-like receptor\u20143 agonist, poly(I): poly(C(12)U), may overcome the problem of a limited supply of H5N1 virus vaccine by providing cross-protective mucosal immunity against H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential.","publish_time":"2007-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ichinohe, Takeshi; Tamura, Shin-ichi; Kawaguchi, Akira; Ninomiya, Ai; Imai, Masaki; Itamura, Shigeyuki; Odagiri, Takato; Tashiro, Masato; Takahashi, Hidehiro; Sawa, Hirofumi; Mitchell, William M.; Strayer, David R.; Carter, William A.; Chiba, Joe; Kurata, Takeshi; Sata, Tetsutaro; Hasegawa, Hideki","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17b3940cd0943595a167c019b739d55f98f85ece.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110255.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzI0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus","strain of H5N1 influenza virus","Avian H5N1 influenza","H5N1 viruses","limited supply of H5N1 virus vaccine","reduced H5N1 virus titer","annual influenza vaccine","H5N1 viral infection","poly","licensed seasonal influenza vaccine","c mice","trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine","cross-protection","noninoculated mice","mucosal IgA","final inoculation","Intranasal inoculation","Subcutaneous inoculation","cross-protective mucosal immunity","intranasally manifested cross-reactivity","pandemic potential","viral strains","cross-reactive IgA response","nasal-wash samples","increased survival","serum IgG","Japan","Toll","challenge","emerging pathogen","substantial human morbidity","Shanghai","problem","receptor","ability","H3N2","mortality","agonist","times","Indonesia","H1N1","NewYork","Ampligen","days","NewCaledonia","BALB","adjuvant","Background","Methods","HongKong","Vietnam","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The special physical requirements for divers and the potential complications associated with deep sea diving necessitate extensive investigation before certification of fitness for diving after SARS. In the early recovery period, potential problems during diving are caused by inadequate lung ventilation in relation to exercise level and increased breathing resistance attributable to weak respiratory muscles, with corresponding risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as decreased ability to respond to nonrespiratory problems during diving. Problems in the late recovery period include increased risk of diving complications (such as pulmonary barotrauma) resulting from fibrosis and scarring within the lung parenchyma, which are known complications of SARS.

The full benefit of the technology, and justification of its initial cost outlay, will be dependent on the establishment within these animals of new traits not easily achievable by other means. Potential applications include enhanced nutrient digestibility with reduced fecal losses, significantly altered milk composition with superior nutritional properties, and enhanced disease resistance. Our goal is to enhance mastitis resistance of dairy cows by enabling the cells of the mammary gland to secrete additional antibacterial proteins. Proof of concept has been obtained through experimentation with a transgenic mouse model. Three lines of mice were developed that produce varying levels of lysostaphin in their milk. This protein has potent anti-staphylococcal activity and its secretion into milk confers substantial resistance to infection caused by intramammary challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, a major mastitis pathogen. Additional antibacterial proteins are being sought that will complement lysostaphin. A potential benefit of transgenic application of antibacterial proteins is the concomitant sparing in the agricultural use of antibiotics currently used as human therapeutics. Antibacterial proteins, such as lysostaphin, are not typically used as injectable or oral therapeutics because of immune-mediated or digestive destruction of their activity. In contrast, the immune system of transgenic animals will not consider the transgenic protein as being foreign. In addition we are exploring the potential of involution or mastitis responsive promoter elements for use in subsequent transgenic experiments designed to restrict lysostaphin production to these important time points. It is anticipated that genomics will play a role in unveiling candidate genes whose promoter elements will enable desired temporal expression patterns. The transgenic approach to insertion of new genetic material into agriculturally important animals is feasible but requires extensive prior evaluation of the transgene and transgene product in model systems.","publish_time":"2003-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kerr, D.

Infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV inhibits cell proliferation. Our previous study indicated that Akt, which is poorly phosphorylated in confluent cultures of Vero E6 cells, is phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated upon infection by SARS-CoV. In the present study, we showed that a serine residue of Akt was phosphorylated in Vero E6 cells in subconfluent culture and that Akt was dephosphorylated rapidly after SARS-CoV infection without up-regulation of its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03B2, which is one of the downstream targets of Akt, was prevented in SARS-CoV-infected cells. However, treatment with glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03B2 small interfering RNA indicated that the glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03B2 signaling pathway was not related to inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, which induces dephosphorylation of Akt, inhibited cell proliferation. As shown in our previous studies, apoptosis occurred in virus-infected cells within 18 h postinfection. Cellular mRNA transcription, which was reported to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, was not up-regulated in virus-infected Vero E6 cells, partially as a result of apoptosis. These results suggested that inhibition of cell proliferation is regulated by both the phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and by apoptosis in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.

The adaptation of HEV to suckling mouse brain facilitated serologic testing by the use of common host reagents and compatible animal systems. With hemagglutination inhibition, complement-fixation, and neutralization tests, an antigenic relationship was demonstrated between human coronavirus OC 43 and HEV in specific immune and hyperimmune animal sera. Children and adults with seroconversion to OC 43 antigen had diagnostic rises in titer of antibody to HEV antigens. Individuals with seroconversion to human coronaviruses 229E and B814 demonstrated antibody to HEV but not diagnostic rises in titer. Swine with titers of antibody to HEV had lower or no detectable titers of antibody to coronavirus OC 43. Although the prevalence and geometric mean titer of antibody to DC 43 were higher than the titer of antibody to HEV in every group of normal humans tested, significant differences in antibody response to coronavirus DC 43 and HEV were seen between populations that did or did not have possible contact with swine. The evidence suggested that antibody to HEV in humans probably represented a heterologous response to infection with coronavirus DC 43.

We introduce approximate entropy(ApEn) as the measure of randomness of the dependency maps. We find that there is critical ApEn(c) below which the percolation is continuous, but for larger ApEn, it is a first-order transition. With the increment of ApEn, the p(c) increases until ApEn reaching [Formula: see text] and then remains almost constant. The time scale of the system shows rich properties as ApEn increases.

Here, we determine the ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalue and characterize its deviation across the ensemble through the discrete form of random scale-free network. Remarkably, the analytical approximation derived from the discrete form shows significant improvement over previous results, which implies a more accurate prediction of the epidemic threshold.

We observe numerically that the density of the infected nodes exhibits an exponential increase with time initially, rendering definable a characteristic time for the outbreak. We then derive a formula for scale-free networks, which relates this time to parameters characterizing the traffic dynamics and the network structure such as packet-generation rate and betweenness distribution. The validity of the formula is tested numerically.

However, such gas masks would not protect patients on home mechanical ventilation, as ventilator airflow would bypass the CBRN filter. We therefore evaluated in vivo the safety of adding a standard-issue CBRN filter to the air-outflow port of a home ventilator, as a method for providing TIC protection to such patients. METHODS: Eight adult patients were included in the study. All had been on stable, chronic ventilation via a tracheostomy for at least 3 months before the study. Each patient was ventilated for a period of 1 hour with a standard-issue CBRN filter canister attached to the air-outflow port of their ventilator. Physiological and airflow measurements were made before, during, and after using the filter, and the patients reported their subjective sensation of ventilation continuously during the trial. RESULTS: For all patients, and throughout the entire study, no deterioration in any of the measured physiological parameters and no changes in measured airflow parameters were detected. All patients felt no subjective difference in the sensation of ventilation with the CBRN filter canister in situ, as compared with ventilation without it. This was true even for those patients who were breathing spontaneously and thus activating the ventilator\u2019s trigger/sensitivity function.

The main purposes of such blood markers are (1) to improve infection diagnosis (i.e., differentiation between bacterial vs. viral vs. fungal vs. noninfectious), (2) to help in the early risk stratification and thus provide prognostic information regarding the risk for mortality and other adverse outcomes, and (3) to optimize antibiotic tailoring to individual needs of patients (\u201Cantibiotic stewardship\u201D). Especially in critically ill patients, in whom sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, rapid diagnosis is desirable to start timely and specific treatment. Besides some biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, which is well established and has shown positive effects in regard to utilization of antimicrobials and clinical outcomes, there is a growing number of novel markers from different pathophysiological pathways, where the final proof of an added value to clinical judgment and ultimately clinical benefit to patients is still lacking. Without a doubt, the addition of blood biomarkers to clinical medicine has had a strong impact on the way we care for patients today. Recent trials show that as an adjunct to other clinical and laboratory parameters these markers provide important information about risks for bacterial infection and resolution of infection. Moreover, biomarkers can help to optimize management of patients with serious illness in the intensive care unit, thereby offering more individualized treatment courses with overall improvements in clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heilmann, Eva; Gregoriano, Claudia; Schuetz, Philipp","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2607fce24937addc60c906cead98bec5a9b044f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical outcomes","clinical judgment","clinical medicine","clinical benefit","management of patients","ill patients","individual needs of patients","blood markers","bacterial infection","infection diagnosis","addition of blood biomarkers","mortality","prognostic information","critical care","adverse outcomes","resolution of infection","intensive care unit","important information","growing number of novel markers","serious illness","rapid diagnosis","serious infections","specific treatment","prognostic tests","antibiotic tailoring","antibiotic stewardship","individualized treatment courses","early risk stratification","different pathophysiological pathways","final proof","overall improvements","laboratory parameters","risks","utilization of antimicrobials","added value","major cause of morbidity","sepsis","adjunct","regard","differentiation","interpretation","positive effects","strong impact","main purposes","doubt","Recent trials","procalcitonin"],"language":"en"},

When the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV was used, villous atrophy was seen and TGEV antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in the villous enterocytes. The Miller M6 strain of virus produced less extensive lesions in the segments, but since it was titratable by plaque assay it was used in the subsequent yield reduction assays to determine the antiviral activity of interferon. When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-\u03B1 or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-\u03B1(2a), and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST cells treated in a similar way. However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV. There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum. It was concluded that interferon would be ineffective as a therapeutic for TGEV, although it might be useful prophylactically.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jordan, L.T.; Derbyshire, J.B.","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Miller"],"organizations":["TGEV","ST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["yield of virus","inclusion of interferon","intestinal segments","antiviral activity of interferon","TGEV antigen","virus inoculum","virus yields","Segments of jejunum","antiviral effects of interferon induction","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","units of natural porcine interferon-\u03B1","units of recombinant human interferon-\u03B1","Miller M6 strain of virus","virulent Purdue strain of TGEV","teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic","challenge","hours","plaque assay","ST cells","subsequent yield reduction assays","villous atrophy","villous enterocytes","days old piglets","polycytidylic acid","swine testis","cell cultures","cytokines","extensive lesions","suspensions","similar way","histology","trend","reductions"],"language":"en"},

Since IL-4 exhibits a variety of functions on the cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, we examined the effects of IL-4on the functions of microglia. Recombinant IL-4 induced the proliferation of microglia in a dose- and time-dependent manner as determined by MTT colorimetric assay, [(3)H]thymidine uptake and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. IL-4 also synergistically enhanced the proliferation of microglia with such colony-stimulating factors as IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). It also increased acid phosphatase activity and superoxide anion formation by these cells. Despite these positive effects on proliferation and activation, IL-4 suppressed the IFN \u03B3-induced class II MHC antigen expression in these cells. Since these effects of recombinant IL-4 inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibody against IL-4 receptors, the effects of IL-4 on microglia appear to be a specific function via IL-4 receptors. Although microglia and astrocytes produce a variety of immunoregulatory cytokines, neither cell produced IL-4 as determined by bioassay or detection of IL-4 mRNA by RT-PCR method. Thus, the exogenous IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of microglia in or around inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system, and may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of microglia.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzumura, Akio; Sawada, Makoto; Itoh, Yasuhiro; Marunouchi, Tohru","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTT","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of IL","detection of IL","exogenous IL","effects of recombinant IL","proliferation of microglia","functions of microglia","accumulation of microglia","regulatory mechanisms of microglia","positive effects","granulocyte-macrophage colony","macrophage lineage","receptors","cells of monocyte","variety of functions","GM-CSF","receptor mRNA","variety of immunoregulatory cytokines","IFN \u03B3-induced class","superoxide anion formation","MHC antigen expression","inflammatory lesions","bromodeoxyuridine","acid phosphatase activity","time-dependent manner","dose","express interleukin","thymidine uptake","BrdU","MTT colorimetric assay","central nervous system","brain macrophages","astrocytes","addition of monoclonal antibody","activation","specific function","factors","RT-PCR method","incorporation","bioassay"],"language":"en"},

The conserved region containing the upstream MHC class I regulatory element (MHC-CRE) and juxtaposed interferon consensus sequence (ICS) enhanced consttutive MHC class I promoter activity. As seen with cell surface expression of MHC molecules, treatment of astrocytes with IFN-\u03B3 increased MHC class I promoter activity. Inducible expression required the presence of the MHC-CRE/ICS enhancer region. Nuclear factors that bind to the MHC-CRE and ICS were constitutively expressed in cultured astrocytes and IFN-\u03B3 treatment further induced binding activity both to the MHC-CRE and ICS and correlated with induction of MHC class I gene expression. This study identifies the MHC-CRE and ICS as the major cis elements in controlling MHC class I promoter activity and suggests that the expression of nuclear factor binding activities to these enhancer elements is a basic transactivating mechanism for the expression of MHC class I genes in astrocytes.","publish_time":"2002-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massa, Paul T.; Hirschfeld, Steven; Levi, Ben-Zion; Quigley, Laura A.; Ozato, Keiko; McFarlin, Dale E.","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Astrocytes"],"organizations":["MHC","ICS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of MHC class","MHC-CRE","consttutive MHC class","upstream MHC class","induction of MHC class","IFN-\u03B3 increased MHC class","cell surface expression of MHC molecules","gene expression","Inducible expression","induced expression","treatment of astrocytes","promoter activity","IFN-\u03B3 treatment","expression of nuclear factor","interferon-\u03B3","ICS enhancer region","murine astrocytes","cultured astrocytes","binding activity","enhancer elements","major cis elements","inducible major histocompatibility complex","conserved region","Nuclear factors","juxtaposed interferon consensus sequence","basic transactivating mechanism","regulatory element","molecular basis of constitutive","activities","cells","presence","genes","primary culture","study"],"language":"en"},

In addition to vaccine development and vector control, the search for antiviral agents that alleviate symptoms in patients are of considerable interest. Among others, the flaviviral protease NS2B-NS3 is a promising drug target to inhibit viral replication. Flaviviral proteases share a high degree of structural similarity and substrate-recognition profile, which may facilitate a strategy towards development of pan-flaviviral protease inhibitors. However, the success of various drug discovery attempts during the last decade has been limited by the nature of the viral enzyme as well as a lack of robust structural templates. Small-molecular, structurally diverse protease inhibitors have been reported to reach affinities in the lower micromolar range. Peptide-based, substrate-derived compounds are often nanomolar inhibitors, however, with highly compromised drug-likeness. With some exceptions, the antiviral cellular activity of most of the reported compounds have been patchy and insufficient for further development. Recent progress has been made in the elucidation of inhibitor binding using different structural methods. This will hopefully lead to more rational attempts for the identification of various lead compounds that may be successful in cellular assays, animal models and ultimately translated to patients.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nitsche, Christoph","journal":"Dengue and Zika: Control and Antiviral Treatment Strategies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a448cd641ab17b2f3f23800569912369d60409f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121277/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flaviviral protease inhibitors","reported compounds","diverse protease inhibitors","substrate-derived compounds","development of pan","flaviviral protease NS2B-NS3","identification of various lead compounds","vaccine development","nanomolar inhibitors","Flaviviral proteases","patients","success of various drug discovery attempts","promising drug target","different structural methods","antiviral cellular activity","compromised drug-likeness","high degree of structural similarity","antiviral agents","lack of robust structural templates","cellular assays","rational attempts","viral replication","viral enzyme","substrate-recognition profile","vector control","search","flaviviruses","elucidation of inhibitor binding","symptoms","animal models","continuing public health threat","affinities","addition","decade","strategy","Small-molecular","lower micromolar range","Infections","nature","exceptions","Peptide","Recent progress"],"language":"en"},

With the protocols described in this chapter, a laboratory with skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and protein biochemistry can readily identify peptides in the library that bind selectively, and with micromolar affinity, to a given target protein on the time scale of 2 months. To illustrate this approach, we use a library of bacteriophage M13 particles, which display 12-mer combinatorial peptides, to affinity select different peptide ligands for two different targets, the SH3 domain of the human Lyn protein tyrosine kinase and a segment of the yeast serine/threonine protein kinase Cbk1. The binding properties of the selected peptide ligands are then dissected by sequence alignment, Kunkel mutagenesis, and alanine scanning.

Continual refinement of animal toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, however, can be an effective means of reducing the numbers of animals used and conserving time and resources without compromising scientific quality. We must continue to strive to find species and strains that can metabolize chemicals similar to humans, are small enough to be housed in large numbers, and have low prevalence of spontaneous lesions with sufficient life span to express the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Adequate care of animals with control of variables such as light, temperature, diet, bedding, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals will decrease the variability. Humane considerations and euthanasia of animals with large masses and other conditions interfering with eating and drinking, major injuries and ulcers related to husbandry and treatment, and diseases indicating pain and suffering will help not only to alleviate further pain and distress but also to facilitate collection of tissues without secondary complications for detection of chemical treatment-related lesions. Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to ageassociated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known. Genetically engineered animal models with known oncogenes may reduce the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a reduction in the use of animals.","publish_time":"2004-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, Ghanta N.; Huff, James","journal":"Fundam Appl Toxicol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzgzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["numbers of animals","euthanasia of animals","use of animals","duration of studies","refinement of carcinogenesis studies","sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies","long-term studies","Adequate care of animals","carcinogenic potential of chemicals","chemicals similar","representative chemicals","genetic characters of laboratory animals","diseases","large numbers","evaluation of selected chemicals","species","variability","pain","detection of chemical treatment-related lesions","large masses","Continual refinement of animal toxicity","known oncogenes","Humane considerations","engineered animal models","low prevalence of spontaneous lesions","sufficient life span","bedding","secondary complications","class","conserving time","major injuries","drinking","eating","ulcers","temperature","husbandry","toxicology research","control of variables","resources","conditions","selection","reduction","foreseeable future","collection of tissues","diet","ageassociated changes","scientific quality","sensitive sex","humans","alternatives","strains","effective means","distress","suffering","chance"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to search for likely microbial agents in diseased tissues using immunocytochemical techniques. Methods Intestines and mesenteric lymph node specimens of 21 patients from two French families with a high frequency of Crohn\u0027s disease and from Connecticut were studied. The microbial agents searched for included Bacteroides vulgatus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Escherichia coil, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, influenza A virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results Seventy-five percent of the patients with Crohn\u0027s disease (12 of 16) were positively labeled with the antibody to Listeria. Macrophages and giant cells immunolabeled for this antigen were distributed underneath ulcers, along fissures, around abscesses, within the lamina propria, in granulomas, and in the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, 57% (12 of 21) of the cases contained the E. coli antigen, and 44% (7 of 16) contained the streptococcal antigen. The immunolabeling for the latter two agents also occurred within macrophages and giant cells, distributed in a pattern similar to that of Listeria antigen. Conclusions The results suggest that Listeria spp., E. coli, and streptococci, but not measles virus, play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn\u0027s disease.","publish_time":"2005-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ying; Van Kruiningen, Herbert J.; West, A.Brian; Cartun, Richard W.; Cortot, Antoine; Colombel, Jean-Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Connecticut"],"keyphrases":["measles virus","Listeria antigen","parainfluenza virus","initiation of Crohn\u0027s disease","pathogenesis of Crohn\u0027s disease","coli antigen","respiratory syncytial virus","Listeria monocytogenes","high frequency of Crohn\u0027s disease","Infectious agents","streptococcal antigen","likely microbial agents","bovine viral diarrhea virus","patients","role","giant cells","Macrophages","Results","mesenteric lymph node specimens","germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes","Streptococcus","Escherichia coil","Borrelia burgdorferi","Bacteroides vulgatus","diseased tissues","French families","Methods Intestines","immunocytochemical techniques","pattern similar","abscesses","granulomas","percent","lamina propria","study","ulcers","Connecticut","streptococci","fissures","Background","cases","Conclusions","objective","immunolabeling","antibody","addition"],"language":"en"},

OUTCOMES: Outcomes evaluated include need and effectiveness of antibiotics to prevent infections in obstetrical procedures. EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline and The Cochrane Library on the topic of antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetrical procedures. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Searches were updated on a regular basis and articles published from January 1978 to June 2009 were incorporated in the guideline. Current guidelines published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology were also incorporated. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by the Infectious Diseases Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada under the leadership of the principal authors, and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Implementation of this guideline should reduce the cost and harm resulting from the administration of antibiotics when they are not required and the harm resulting from failure to administer antibiotics when they would be beneficial. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: 1. Available evidence does not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infectious morbidity following operative vaginal delivery. (II-1); 2. There is insufficient evidence to argue for or against the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infectious morbidity for manual removal of the placenta. (III); 3. There is insufficient evidence to argue for or against the use of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of postpartum dilatation and curettage for retained products of conception. (III); 4. Available evidence does not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infectious morbidity following elective or emergency cerclage. (II-3). RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. All women undergoing elective or emergency Caesarean section should receive antibiotic prophylaxis. (I-A); 2. The choice of antibiotic for Caesarean section should be a single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin. If the patient has a penicillin allergy, clindamycin or erythromycin can be used. (I-A); 3. The timing of prophylactic antibiotics for Caesarean section should be 15 to 60 minutes prior to skin incision. No additional doses are recommended. (I-A); 4. If an open abdominal procedure is lengthy (\u003E 3 hours) or estimated blood loss is greater than 1500 mL, an additional dose of the prophylactic antibiotic may be given 3 to 4 hours after the initial dose. (III-L); 5. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered for the reduction of infectious morbidity associated with repair of third and fourth degree perineal injury. (I-B); 6. In patients with morbid obesity (BMI \u003E 35), doubling the antibiotic dose may be considered. (III-B); 7. Antibiotics should not be administered solely to prevent endocarditis for patients who undergo an obstetrical procedure of any kind.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mbrABCD-related bacitracin resistance mechanism of S. mutans. Transcriptome data demonstrated that the expression levels of 33 genes were induced more than twofold by bacitracin. Fourteen genes were selected from the upregulated genes, and defective mutants of these genes were constructed for measurement of their sensitivity to bacitracin. Among the mutants, only the mbrA- or mbrB-deficient mutants exhibited 100- to 121-fold greater sensitivity to bacitracin when compared with the wild-type strain. Moreover, knockout of the mbrC and mbrD genes abolished the bacitracin-induced mbrAB upregulation. These results suggest that both mbrC and mbrD are required for mbrAB upregulation that confers the bacitracin-resistant phenotype on S. mutans.

Sixty-seven percent of HCWs stated they would be available to work during a pandemic, 26% stated they would stay at home to care for their children, whereas 10% admitted they would stay away because of fear of catching influenza. The majority of employees expected to be provided with personal protective equipment, antivirals and vaccine (92%, 90% and 89%, respectively). HCWs also believed that family members should be supplied with antivirals and vaccine (64% and 63%, respectively), 20% believed they needed a place of residence while working, 45% were prepared to be relocated to another site, and 36% were prepared to change to another duty. The survey highlights several areas that need attention in preparing for a pandemic. Targeted education is required now for all those HCWs who will be expected to work during a pandemic.

The risk of respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas was similar to that of HCWs in high risk area. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that female HCWs and staffs working in larger hospitals are the focus of prevention and control of respiratory infection in Beijing hospitals. Mask-wearing and seasonal influenza vaccination are protective for respiratory infection in HCWs; the protective efficacy of medical masks is better than that of cotton yarn ones; respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas should also be given attention.","publish_time":"2011-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Peng; Seale, Holly; Raina MacIntyre, C.; Zhang, Haiyan; Zhang, Zhen; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Xiaoli; Li, Xinyu; Pang, Xinghuo; Wang, Quanyi","journal":"Braz J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzEzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["risk of respiratory infection of HCWs","control of respiratory infection","female HCWs","Beijing hospitals","larger hospitals","good mask","rates of mask","low risk areas","seasonal influenza vaccination","cotton-yarn","high risk area","subjects","protective efficacy of medical masks","cotton yarn ones","face interview","focus of prevention","females","staffs","healthcare workers","study","data","reference","odds ratio","standardized questionnaire","factors","OBJECTIVES","aim","CONCLUSION","confidence interval","contact","adherence","survey","attention","winter","patients","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

After parasite invasion, red blood cells progressively acquire a new set of properties and are converted into more typical, although still simpler, eukaryotic cells by the appearance of new structures in the red blood cell cytoplasm, and new proteins at the red blood cell membrane skeleton. The red blood cell undergoes striking morphological alterations and its rheological properties are considerably altered, manifesting as red blood cells with increased membrane rigidity, reduced deformability and increased adhesiveness for a number of other cells including the vascular endothelium. Elucidation of the structural changes in the red blood cell induced by parasite invasion and maturation and an understanding of the accompanying functional alterations have the ability to considerably extend our knowledge of structure-function relationships in the normal red blood cell. Furthermore, interference with these interactions may lead to previously unsuspected means of reducing parasite virulence and may lead to the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooke, Brian M.; Mohandas, Narla; Coppel, Ross L.","journal":"Adv Parasitol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzIyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["normal red blood cell","red blood cell cytoplasm","red blood cell membrane skeleton","red blood cells of various species","eukaryotic cells","parasite invasion","new proteins","new set of properties","parasite virulence","increased membrane rigidity","appearance of new structures","increased adhesiveness","rheological properties","striking morphological alterations","accompanying functional alterations","reduced deformability","genus Plasmodium","function relationships","understanding","number","maturation","structural changes","asexual stage of malaria parasites","knowledge of structure","unsuspected means","humans","development of novel antimalarial therapeutics","interactions","vascular endothelium","Elucidation","interference"],"language":"en"},

ISEM methods presented in the chapter include all the techniques where the \u201Csolid phase principle\u201D is essential in a way similar to other solid phase immunoassays. These methods include (1) the antibody-coated grid technique (AB-CGT); (2) the protein A-coated grid technique (PA-CGT); (3) the protein A-coated bacteria technique (PA-CBT); and (4) the antigen-coated grid technique (AG-CGT). In all ISEM methods, one of the components of the system is adsorbed to a solid phase. In AG-CGT, PA-CGT, and AB-CGT, one of the reagents is adsorbed to an electron microscopic grid, while in PA-CBT protein A is naturally present on the surface of a bacterium that serves as a solid support. In ISEM methods, the viruses can be statistically evaluated and numerically expressed as number of virions per unit of area, and can, therefore, be statistically evaluated. Thus, these methods optimize the results of a test by quantifying the effects of the quality of the supporting grid, the time of adsorption, the pH, the presence of salts, and the type of staining. The ISEM also permits a detailed study of antigenic variations in the same genus of virus, and thus would visually pinpoint the type or strain differences.","publish_time":"2008-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katz, David; Kohn, Alexander","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130987/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISEM methods","PA-CGT","AG-CGT","AB-CGT","antibody-coated grid technique","antigen-coated grid technique","coated bacteria technique","supporting grid","PA-CBT protein","electron microscopic grid","solid phase principle","solid phase immunoassays","solid support","chapter","type of staining","newer modifications of immunosorbent electron microscopy","way similar","time of adsorption","detailed study of antigenic variations","presence of salts","bacterium","plant","techniques","number of virions","unit of area","effects","quality","test","animal virology","system","reagents","components","genus of virus","surface","strain differences","results","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Recent advancements in viral-vectored malaria vaccine development and emerging vector technologies were presented and discussed. Classic viral vectors such as poxvirus, adenovirus and alphavirus vectors have been successfully used to deliver malaria antigens. Some of the vaccine candidates have demonstrated their potential in inducing malaria-specific immunity in animal models and human trials. In addition, emerging viral-vector technologies, such as measles virus (MV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and yellow fever (YF) virus, may also be useful for malaria vaccine development. Studies in animal models suggest that each viral vector is unique in its ability to induce humoral and/or cellular immune responses. Those studies have also revealed that optimization of Plasmodium genes for mammalian expression is an important aspect of vaccine design. Codon-optimization, surface-trafficking, de-glycosylation and removal of toxic domains can lead to improved immunogenicity. Understanding the vector\u0027s ability to induce an immune response and the expression of malaria antigens in mammalian cells will be critical in designing the next generation of viral-vectored malaria vaccines.","publish_time":"2007-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shengqiang; Locke, Emily; Bruder, Joseph; Clarke, David; Doolan, Denise L.; Havenga, Menzo J.E.; Hill, Adrian V.S.; Liljestrom, Peter; Monath, Thomas P.; Naim, Hussein Y.; Ockenhouse, Christian; Tang, De-chu C.; Van Kampen, Kent R.; Viret, Jean-Francois; Zavala, Fidel; Dubovsky, Filip","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131149.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131149/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral-vectored malaria vaccine development","expression of malaria antigens","PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative","vectored malaria vaccines","generation of viral","vaccine candidates","Classic viral vectors","emerging viral-vector technologies","inducing malaria-specific immunity","emerging vector technologies","important aspect of vaccine design","mammalian expression","measles virus","animal models","alphavirus vectors","Studies","vesicular stomatitis virus","mammalian cells","Codon-optimization","vector\u0027s ability","optimization of Plasmodium genes","cellular immune responses","de-glycosylation","VSV","potential","poxvirus","removal of toxic domains","surface-trafficking","yellow fever","MV","adenovirus","human trials","Recent advancements","YF","addition","workshop","improved immunogenicity","Bethesda","MD"],"language":"en"},

Women are affected more often than men, a phenomenon associated with a number of auto-immune diseases. Although the etiology of MS is unknown, it is generally believed that genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors are involved. This chapter discusses these issues as they suggest that exogenous factors are associated with the pathogenesis of this disorder. Recently, the human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) has received considerable attention as an infectious agent candidate that might be associated with the pathogenesis of MS. The chapter focuses on this agent and the data that support the role of this virus in MS disease pathogenesis. A model is proposed, whereby in genetically susceptible individuals, multiple viruses may trigger either a virus-specific or a cross-reactive auto-immune response that results in clinical MS.

RNA-1 directs the synthesis of 88-kDa (p88), 57-kDa (p57), 37-kDa (p37), and 27-kDa (p27) polypeptides and RNA-2 a 35-kDa (p35) polypeptide in vitro. The coding order of the RNA-1 products was determined to be 5\u2032-p27-p57-p37-3\u2032. Antibodies to synthetic peptides representing the carboxyl terminal portions of p27 and p57 immunoprecipitated their respective polypeptides in addition to p88, suggesting that p88 is a fusion protein. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV RNA-1. In addition, a stable stem-loop secondary structure adjacent to the heptanucleotide sequence is predicted. Together, these sequence elements suggest that a ribosomal frameshifting event occurs which allows translational readthrough of the p27 open reading frame into the p57 open reading frame, generating the observed p88 product. An RNA-1 expression construct fusing the p57 and the CP open reading frame was engineered to investigate the ribosomal frameshifting event. CP antibodies immunoprecipitated a fusion protein of the predicted size containing the carboxyl portion of CP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the frameshift element indicates that in vitro, p88 can also be expressed alternatively by suppression of an amber termination codon. Based on these data, we propose that the putative RCNMV RNA polymerase is an 88-kDa polypeptide expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism similar to those utilized by retroviruses.","publish_time":"2002-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Z.; Kim, K.H.; Kendall, T.L.; Lommel, S.A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131720/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p27-p57","kDa polypeptide","p57 open reading frame","putative RCNMV RNA polymerase","p27 open reading frame","single-stranded RNA species","CP open reading frame","ribosomal frameshifting event","observed p88 product","frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element","carboxyl terminal portions of p27","ribosomal frameshifting mechanism similar","addition","sequence elements","frameshift element","CP antibodies","fusion protein","p37","carboxyl portion of","respective polypeptides","predicted size","stable stem-loop secondary structure adjacent","translational readthrough","red clover necrotic mosaic virus","genome","synthetic peptides","mutagenesis","Site","expression construct","suppression","amber termination codon","synthesis","coding order","retroviruses","products","p35","data"],"language":"en"},

Translational regulation is predominantly exerted during the initiation phase that is considered to be the rate-limiting step. Two types of translational regulation can be distinguished: global, in which the initiation rate of (nearly) all cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) is controlled and selective, in which the translation rate of specific mRNAs varies in response to the biological stimuli. In most cases of global regulation, control is exerted via the phosphorylation state of certain initiation factors, whereas only a few examples of selective regulation have been characterized well enough to define the underlying molecular events. Interestingly, cis-acting regulatory sequences, affecting translation initiation, have been found not only in the 5\u2019UTRs of selectively regulated mRNAs, but also in the 3\u2019UTRs. Thus, in addition to the protein encoding open reading frames, both the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019UTRs of mRNAs must be considered for their effect on translation.","publish_time":"2008-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pantopoulos, Kostas; Johansson, Hans E.; Hentze, Matthias W.","journal":"Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["translation initiation","initiation rate","initiation phase","UTRs of mRNAs","translation rate of specific mRNAs","types of translational regulation","cases of global regulation","examples of selective regulation","field of translational control","regulated mRNAs","phosphorylation state of certain initiation factors","possibility","response","recent advances","untranslated region","protein","regulatory sequences","open reading frames","powerful antisense technology","cellular messenger RNA","addition","biological stimuli","underlying molecular events","chapter","role","effect","unanswered questions","step"],"language":"en"},

Rotaviruses were most commonly found in winter and between the ages of six and eighteen months. A history of contact with an adult with diarrheoa, vomiting occuring before diarrhoea, accompanying upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), otitis media and pyrexia and the need for administration of intravenous fluids were all significantly more prominent features of the rotavirus than the non-specific cases of gastroenteritis, and are suggested as pointers to such a diagnosis.

Isolation of rhinoviruses occurs in a distinct and consistent seasonal pattern that can be used to help determine whether an acute respiratory illness is caused by a rhinovirus. Objective: This article reviews information on the seasonality of rhinovirus infection derived from early and recent studies of rhinovirus occurrence and treatment. Methods: PubMed was searched from 1965 to the present to identify all potentially relevant papers. The search terms used were rhinovirus and seasonality. A total of 1998 papers were screened. Results: Rhinoviruses comprise more than three quarters of viruses circulating in early autumn. In some years and perhaps some geographic areas, spring is an even more important time for rhinovirus transmission. Although overall rates of respiratory illness are lower in summer, rhinoviruses are the most frequently isolated virus at this time of year. Other viral agents, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (particularly with parainfluenza virus), predominate in the winter. Thus, for most of the year, rhinoviruses are the cause of the majority of acute viral respiratory infections. Conclusion: Understanding the seasonal incidence of rhinovirus infection may help determine how best to employ currently available antirhinoviral agents in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute viral respiratory infection.","publish_time":"2003-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monto, Arnold S.","journal":"Clin Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2219620e84342b84e1ac0b8cd1e7be4703dd5799.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory illness","seasonality of rhinovirus infection","rhinovirus transmission","respiratory syncytial virus","majority of acute viral respiratory infections","common cause of acute respiratory infections","seasonal incidence of rhinovirus infection","Isolation of rhinoviruses","overall rates of respiratory illness","recent studies of rhinovirus occurrence","parainfluenza virus","isolated virus","time of year","influenza viruses","early autumn","quarters of viruses","important time","relevant papers","available antirhinoviral agents","consistent seasonal pattern","symptoms","patients","article reviews information","spring","treatment","summer","geographic areas","Objective","search terms","years","Conclusion","Background","Methods","PubMed","total","winter","Results"],"language":"en"},

When administered intraperitoneally in divided doses, significant protection from death was conferred at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day given 24 and 17 h pre-virus inoculation, 25\u2013100 mg/kg/day administered 4 h pre- and 3 h post-virus challenge, and 12.5 to 100 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 31 h after virus inoculation. These doses preventing death reduced liver icterus scores, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and serum virus titers relative to placebo controls. Full daily doses administered at 24 h were somewhat less protective to mice than divided daily doses starting at the same time. The initiation of treatment could be delayed as late as 36 h after virus inoculation, resulting in complete protection from mortality at 100 mg/kg/day. This prevention of death occurred despite the acute nature of the infection which resulted in deaths by 96 h in the placebo-treated controls. These results show that 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine has both prophylactic and therapeutic potential as an anti-Phlebovirus agent.

In the present study, duodenal molecules were isolated from normal mice which had potent virucidal activity, when tested against LDV as well as canine herpes, canine hepatitis, Semliki forest, and visna viruses. The virucidal activity was demonstrated to be non-immune in nature, and was present in apparently non-enzymatic protein molecules, having a molecular mass of between 10\u2013100 kDa by membrane filtration and 10\u201317 kDa by gel filtration. The anti-LDV activity of these molecules was suppressed by anti-duodenum antibodies in vitro, and in vivo studies suggested a possible protective role for the anti-viral molecules. We conclude that the normal mouse duodenum contains potent virucidal molecules, which are of interest to the study of biological and molecular mechanisms of viral resistance.","publish_time":"1992-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broen, James J.; DesJarlais, Scott E.; Duman, Richard G.; Anderson, Steven N.; Mueller, Richard A.; Cafruny, William A.","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-viral molecules","potent virucidal molecules","anti-LDV activity","duodenal molecules","potent virucidal activity","viral infection","present study","LDV system","non-enzymatic protein molecules","study of mucosal barriers","Mucosal resistance","study of biological","molecular mechanisms of viral resistance","anti-duodenum antibodies","kDa","normal mouse duodenum","normal mice","canine hepatitis","canine herpes","molecular mass","membrane filtration","gel filtration","Semliki forest","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","important murine model","possible protective role","studies","visna viruses","nature"],"language":"en"},

Thirty MAbs, each of which reacted with the FLV-producing cell line, were tested for potential neutralizing activities; only two MAbs inhibited the proliferation of the A8 virus. These two MAbs were ineffective or had very weak neutralizing activities toward the non-neurotropic FLV strain clone 57 virus. Further characterization of MAbs by immunoprecipitation revealed that 4 MAbs recognized the envelope protein of the A8 virus. Two of these 4 MAbs recognized the surface glycoprotein gp70, requiring the conformational epitope of the virus for this recognition, while the other two MAbs, which were reactive with the transmembrane protein p15E, were conformation-independent Both of the MAbs against gp70 distinguished neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic viruses to some extent, through neutralizing activity or binding activity detected by immunoprecipitation, whereas the two MAbs against p15E reacted with the viruses in a similar manner. Furthermore, one of the MAbs distinguished the viral antigen in the wall of the vacuolation that composes the spongiotic lesion induced by FrC6 viral infection of the brain.","publish_time":"2000-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ikeda, Tomio; Takase-Yoden, Sayaka; Watanabe, Rihito","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["characterization of MAbs","FrC6 virus","A8 viruses","FLV complex","neutralizing activity","non-neuropathogenic viruses","molecular clone A8","non-neurotropic FLV strain clone","weak neutralizing activities","FrC6 viral infection","potential neutralizing activities","gp70 distinguished neuropathogenic","immunoprecipitation","NB-tropic Friend murine leukemia virus","transmembrane protein p15E","neurotropic retrovirus","binding activity","envelope protein","viral antigen","surface glycoprotein gp70","extent","monoclonal antibodies","spongiotic lesion","conformational epitope","conformation-independent","vacuolation","replication-competent","cell line","wall","brain","recognition","proliferation","similar manner","detection"],"language":"en"},

Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID(50)/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infected vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5 \u03BCg/10(6) cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfected cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific (51)Cr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFN\u03B1) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infected AM was reduced compared to noninfected AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P \u2A7D 0.025. The results provide support to the premise that the role of AM in lung defense can be compromised by PRV infection.","publish_time":"2002-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iglesias, Gerardo; Pijoan, Carlos; Molitor, Thomas","journal":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133968/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartha"],"organizations":["PRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRV-infected vero cells","noninfected cells","K562 cells","target cells","virulent PRV strains","virulent strains of PRV","supernatants of PRV","PRV infection","lysis of PRV","chicken red blood cells","human myeloblastoma cells","cultures","production of IFN","antiviral activity present","cytotoxicity assays","antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay","producton of IFN","antibody-dependent way","human leukocyte IFN","antibody-independent way","Culture supernatants","production of interferon","strain S","K562 cell line","supernatant collection","Pseudorabies virus","h poststimulation","interferon-alpha","multiplicity of infection","Alveolar macrophages","various times poststimulation","tissue culture media","Cr release values","Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test","antiserum","polycytidylic acid","role","concentration","optimal time","polyinosinic","treatment","lung defense","BUK","support","premise","IFN\u03B1","\u03BCg","difference","ways","Bartha","results","Swine","TCID","pigs"],"language":"en"},

These are important in determining the final configuration of specific glycoproteins. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) encodes a number of glycoproteins, some of which ultimately reside in the outer envelope of the mature virion and are important for virus infectivity. Treatment with three polyhydroxyalkaloids, castanospermine (CAST), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R, 4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) blocked the growth of infectious virus, as determined by yield reduction and plaque reduction assays. However, in the presence of CAST, CMV infected cells continued to shed virions into the extracellular medium, as determined by electron microscopy. Envelope glycoproteins of virions produced after treatment with CAST (2.5 mM) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (F5) specific for the gcI family of glycoproteins. Analysis by PAGE-SDS showed an absence of gcI complex 2 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp130) with a proportional increase in gcI complex 1 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp95). The results indicated that gp130 alone, or linked to gp52, was important for CMV infectivity. As well as being potential targets for antiviral agents against CMV, inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming reactions may define components of the virion surface important for infectivity.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, D.L.; Fellows, L.E.; Farrar, G.H.; Nash, R.J.; Taylor-Robinson, D.; Mobberley, M.A.; Ryder, T.A.; Jeffries, D.J.; Tyms, A.S.","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzcxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV infectivity","gcI family of glycoproteins","Envelope glycoproteins of virions","gp52 disulphide","R-dihydroxypyrrolidine","R-dihydroxymethyl","virus infectivity","number of glycoproteins","virion surface important","CMV infected cells","absence of gcI complex","polyhydroxyalkaloids","presence of CAST","final configuration of specific glycoproteins","gp130","Treatment","mature virion","inhibitors of glycoprotein","yield reduction","outer envelope","oligosaccharide trimming","potent inhibitors of glucosidases","plaque reduction assays","growth of infectious virus","antiviral agents","enzymes","F5","components","reactions","proportional increase","PAGE-SDS","DMDP","potential targets","deoxynojirimycin","castanospermine","DNJ","extracellular medium","monoclonal antibody","plants","electron microscopy","Human cytomegalovirus","Analysis","gp95","results"],"language":"en"},

We performed a prospective observational study of 955 cases of adult CAP in 14 hospitals in eight Asian countries. Microbiological evaluation to determine etiological pathogens as well as clinical evaluation was performed. Bronchopulmonary disease (29.9%) was the most frequent underlying disease, followed by cardiovascular diseases (19.9%), malignancy (11.7%) and neurological disorder (8.2%). Streptococcus pneumoniae (29.2%) was the most common isolate, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.1%). Serological tests were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (11.0%) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.4%). Only 1.1% was positive for Legionella pneumophila by urinary antigen test. Of the pneumococcal isolates, 56.1% were resistant to erythromycin and 52.6% were not susceptible to penicillin. Seventeen percent of CAP had mixed infection, especially S. pneumoniae with C. pneumoniae. The overall mortality rate was 7.3%, and nursing home residence, mechanical ventilation, malignancy, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory rate \u003E 30/min and hyponatraemia were significant independent risk factors for mortality by multivariate analysis (P \u003C 0.05).

Although the method of transmission of rhinoviruses is disputed, several studies have demonstrated that aerosol transmission is a likely method of transmission among adults. As a first step in studies of possible airborne rhinovirus transmission, we developed methods to detect aerosolized rhinovirus by extending existing technology for detecting infectious agents in nasal specimens. METHODS: We aerosolized rhinovirus in a small aerosol chamber. Experiments were conducted with decreasing concentrations of rhinovirus. To determine the effect of UV irradiation on detection of rhinoviral aerosols, we also conducted experiments in which we exposed aerosols to a UV dose of 684 mJ/m(2). Aerosols were collected on Teflon filters and rhinovirus recovered in Qiagen AVL buffer using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen Corp., Valencia, California) followed by semi-nested RT-PCR and detection by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: We obtained positive results from filter samples that had collected at least 1.3 TCID(50 )of aerosolized rhinovirus. Ultraviolet irradiation of airborne virus at doses much greater than those used in upper-room UV germicidal irradiation applications did not inhibit subsequent detection with the RT-PCR assay. CONCLUSION: The air sampling and extraction methodology developed in this study should be applicable to the detection of rhinovirus and other airborne viruses in the indoor air of offices and schools. This method, however, cannot distinguish UV inactivated virus from infectious viral particles.","publish_time":"2003-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myatt, Theodore A; Johnston, Sebastian L; Rudnick, Stephen; Milton, Donald K","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e1286db212100993d03cc22374b624f7caee956.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC140314.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC140314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Qiagen AVL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of rhinovirus","aerosolized rhinovirus","studies of possible airborne rhinovirus transmission","decreasing concentrations of rhinovirus","aerosol transmission","effect of UV irradiation","detection of rhinoviral aerosols","likely method of transmission","subsequent detection","UV dose","UV inactivated virus","Ultraviolet irradiation of airborne virus","airborne viruses","upper-room UV germicidal irradiation applications","methods","Experiments","Qiagen AVL buffer","infectious viral particles","RT-PCR assay","Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Kit","semi-nested RT-PCR","infectious agents","air sampling","positive results","asthma exacerbations","asthma deaths","indoor air of offices","small aerosol chamber","common cause of upper respiratory tract infections","existing technology","Valencia","California","doses","extraction methodology","Teflon filters","study","step","filter samples","nasal specimens","gel electrophoresis","CONCLUSION","schools","adults","TCID","rhinoviruses","mJ","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The virus was identified as the causative agent of SARS due to the efforts of a WHO-led laboratory network. The potential mutability of the SARS-CoV genome may lead to new SARS outbreaks and several regions of the viral genomes open reading frames have been identified which may contribute to the severe virulence of the virus. With regard to the pathogenesis of SARS, several mechanisms involving both direct effects on target cells and indirect effects via the immune system may exist. Vaccination would offer the most attractive approach to prevent new epidemics of SARS, but the development of vaccines is difficult due to missing data on the role of immune system-virus interactions and the potential mutability of the virus. Even in a situation of no new infections, SARS remains a major health hazard, as new epidemics may arise. Therefore, further experimental and clinical research is required to control the disease.","publish_time":"2005-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Groneberg, David A; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Zabel, Peter","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d16e1bd4c6cae1bb55dbc695c5e2ba5105a13921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC548145.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC548145/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozcx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new epidemics of SARS","new SARS outbreaks","pathogenesis of SARS","SARS-CoV genome","causative agent of SARS","new infections","new infectious disease","role of immune system-virus interactions","potential mutability","important respiratory disease","indirect effects","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","severe virulence","regions","novel coronavirus","target cells","major health hazard","missing data","viral genomes open reading frames","mortality","widespread occurrence","mechanisms","development of vaccines","attractive approach","deleterious pulmonary pathological features","high morbidity","efforts","situation","clinical research","Vaccination","regard","laboratory network","world"],"language":"en"},

Inspection of the overlap regions between ORF1a and ORF1b of the SARS-CoV genome revealed that, similar to all coronaviruses, a programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift could be used by the virus to produce a fusion protein. Computational analyses of the frameshift signal predicted the presence of an mRNA pseudoknot containing three double-stranded RNA stem structures rather than two. Phylogenetic analyses showed the conservation of potential three-stemmed pseudoknots in the frameshift signals of all other coronaviruses in the GenBank database. Though the presence of the three-stemmed structure is supported by nuclease mapping and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies, our findings suggest that interactions between the stem structures may result in local distortions in the A-form RNA. These distortions are particularly evident in the vicinity of predicted A-bulges in stems 2 and 3. In vitro and in vivo frameshifting assays showed that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal is functionally similar to other viral frameshift signals: it promotes efficient frameshifting in all of the standard assay systems, and it is sensitive to a drug and a genetic mutation that are known to affect frameshifting efficiency of a yeast virus. Mutagenesis studies reveal that both the specific sequences and structures of stems 2 and 3 are important for efficient frameshifting. We have identified a new RNA structural motif that is capable of promoting efficient programmed ribosomal frameshifting. The high degree of conservation of three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot structures among the coronaviruses suggests that this presents a novel target for antiviral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2005-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plant, Ewan P; P\u00E9rez-Alvarado, Gabriela C; Jacobs, Jonathan L; Mukhopadhyay, Bani; Hennig, Mirko; Dinman, Jonathan D","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f07f87e8ef78f0416556e69c88247e588f9192c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1110908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1110908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient frameshifting","efficient programmed ribosomal frameshifting","frameshifting efficiency","frameshifting assays","viral frameshift signals","coronaviruses","structures of stems","stemmed mRNA pseudoknot structures","SARS-CoV frameshift signal","form RNA","double-stranded RNA stem structures","stemmed pseudoknots","stemmed structure","presence","wide range of RNA viruses","new RNA structural motif","SARS-CoV genome","conservation of potential","Mutagenesis studies","production of viral fusion proteins","local distortions","Phylogenetic analyses","Computational analyses","yeast virus","vicinity of predicted","high degree of conservation","two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies","nuclease mapping","ORF1b","findings","ORF1a","specific sequences","overlap regions","interactions","standard assay systems","novel target","antiviral therapeutics","drug","Inspection","genetic mutation","bulges","GenBank database"],"language":"en"},

The SARS Extranet was a single, managed electronic and limited access system to manage local, provincial and other SARS control information. METHODS: During July, 2003, a web-based and paper-based survey was conducted with 53 SARS Steering Committee members in Hamilton. It assessed the use and perceptions of the Extranet that had been built to support the committee during the SARS outbreak. Before distribution, the survey was user-tested based on a think-aloud protocol, and revisions were made. Quantitative and qualitative questions were asked related to frequency of use of the Extranet, perceived overall usefulness of the resource, rationale for use, potential barriers, strengths and limitations, and potential future uses of the Extranet. RESULTS: The response rate was 69.4% (n = 34). Of all respondents, 30 (88.2%) reported that they had visited the site, and rated it highly overall (mean = 4.0; 1 = low to 5 = high). However, the site was rated 3.4 compared with other communications strategies used during the outbreak. Almost half of all respondents (44.1%) visited the site at least once every few days. The two most common reasons the 30 respondents visited the Extranet were to access SARS Steering Committee minutes (63.3%) and to access Hamilton medical advisories (53.3%). The most commonly cited potential future uses for the Extranet were the sending of private emails to public health experts (63.3%), and surveillance (63.3%). No one encountered personal barriers in his or her use of the site, but several mentioned that time and duplication of email information were challenges. CONCLUSION: Despite higher rankings of various communication strategies during the SARS outbreak, such as email, meetings, teleconferences, and other web sites, users generally perceived a local Extranet as a useful support for the dissemination of local information during public health emergencies.","publish_time":"2005-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valaitis, Ruta K; Akhtar-Danesh, Noori; Kealey, Cathy M; Brunetti, Glenn M; Thomas, Helen","journal":"BMC Med Inform Decis Mak","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eddc547cbba693715e4fd55e6a946e8ec7d96bc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1166558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1166558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzExOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS Extranet","SARS","SARS Steering Committee"],"locations":["Hamilton"],"keyphrases":["SARS Extranet","local Extranet","SARS outbreak","SARS control information","future information","SARS Steering Committee members","SARS Steering Committee minutes","dissemination of local information","potential barriers","frequency of use","respondents","cited potential future","duplication of email information","perceptions","useful support","paper-based survey","access Hamilton medical advisories","public health experts","public health emergencies","limited access system","local Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","communication applications","web sites","communications strategies","overall usefulness","personal barriers","higher rankings of various communication strategies","rationale","strengths","sending of private emails","time","resource","limitations","qualitative questions","teleconferences","meetings","users","response rate","think","CONCLUSION","study","challenges","common reasons","protocol","revisions","BACKGROUND","objective","RESULTS","distribution","mean","half","days","METHODS","surveillance"],"language":"en"},

An atypical RNA pseudoknot with an extra stem formed by complementary sequences within loop 2 of an H-type pseudoknot is characterized in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome. This pseudoknot can serve as an efficient stimulator for \u22121 frameshifting in vitro. Mutational analysis of the extra stem suggests frameshift efficiency can be modulated via manipulation of the secondary structure within the loop 2 of an infectious bronchitis virus-type pseudoknot. More importantly, an upstream RNA sequence separated by a linker 5\u2032 to the slippery site is also identified to be capable of modulating the \u22121 frameshift efficiency. RNA sequence containing this attenuation element can downregulate \u22121 frameshifting promoted by an atypical pseudoknot of SARS CoV and two other pseudoknot stimulators. Furthermore, frameshift efficiency can be reduced to half in the presence of the attenuation signal in vivo. Therefore, this in cis RNA attenuator represents a novel negative determinant of general importance for the regulation of \u22121 frameshift efficiency, and is thus a potential antiviral target.","publish_time":"2005-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Mei-Chi; Chang, Chung-Te; Chu, Chiu-Hui; Tsai, Ching-Hsiu; Chang, Kung-Yao","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/308a157fe5e9a630ded41e9d708dd50df3b6149b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1182165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS CoV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["atypical RNA pseudoknot","frameshift efficiency","pseudoknot stimulators","upstream RNA sequence","cis RNA slippery sequence","atypical pseudoknot of SARS CoV","cis RNA attenuator","H-type pseudoknot","downstream stimulator RNA","infectious bronchitis virus-type pseudoknot","extra stem","loop","ribosomal frameshifting","attenuation element","slippery site","attenuation signal","efficient stimulator","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","novel negative determinant of general importance","regulation","linker","existence","complementary sequences","genome","manipulation","half","Mutational analysis","presence","secondary structure","potential antiviral target"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: An automated nucleic acid extraction platform using the MagNA Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics) was evaluated. We developed a modified protocol in compliance with the recommended biosafety guidelines from the World Health Organization based on the use of the MagNA Pure total nucleic acid large volume isolation kit for the extraction of SARS-coronavirus RNA. The modified protocol was compared with a column-based extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit, Qiagen) for quantitative performance, analytical sensitivity and precision. RESULTS: The newly developed automated protocol was shown to be free from carry-over contamination and have comparable performance with other standard protocols and kits designed for the MagNA Pure LC instrument. However, the automated method was found to be less sensitive, less precise and led to consistently lower serum SARS-coronavirus concentrations when compared with the column-based extraction method.

We report here the development of a PCR-based assay that is highly specific for the H5N1 avian influenza A virus. METHODS: A one-step reverse-transcription PCR assay was developed to detect the H5N1 avian influenza A virus. The specificity of the assay was shown by testing sub-types of influenza A virus and other viral and bacterial pathogens; and on field samples. RESULTS: Validation on 145 field specimens from Vietnam and Malaysia showed that the assay was specific without cross reactivity to a number of other infuenza strains as well as human respiratory related pathogens. Detection was 100% from allantoic fluid in H5N1 positive samples, suggesting it to be a reliable sampling source for accurate detection. CONCLUSION: The assay developed from this study indicates that the primers are specific for the H5N1 influenza virus. As shown by the field tested results, this assay would be highly useful as a diagnostic tool to help identify and control influenza epidemics.","publish_time":"2006-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Lisa FP; Barr, Ian; Nguyen, Tung; Noor, Suriani Mohd; Tan, Rosemary Sok-Pin; Agathe, Lora V; Gupta, Sanjay; Khalil, Hassuzana; To, Thanh Long; Hassan, Sharifah Syed; Ren, Ee-Chee","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dca1ffcfcd6a2b7c8495e77c438d6b91d065bbf5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1421410.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1421410/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Vietnam","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["H5N1 influenza virus","pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza","influenza pandemic","PCR-based assay","sub-types of influenza","control influenza epidemics","H5N1 positive samples","field samples","one-step reverse-transcription PCR assay","field specimens","field tested results","bacterial pathogens","accurate detection","human respiratory related pathogens","Asia","infuenza strains","number","Vietnam","allantoic fluid","Malaysia","current diagnostics","Continuous outbreaks","cross reactivity","urgent effort","reliable sampling source","Validation","primers","diagnostic tool","METHODS","containment","development","study","threat","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Health care professionals (HCPs) and hospital systems that bore the brunt of the SARS outbreak continue to struggle with the aftermath of the crisis. Indeed, HCPs \u2013 both in clinical care and in public health \u2013 were severely tested by SARS. Unprecedented demands were placed on their skills and expertise, and their personal commitment to their profession was severely tried. Many were exposed to serious risk of morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by the World Health Organization figures showing that approximately 30% of reported cases were among HCPs, some of whom died from the infection. Despite this challenge, professional codes of ethics are silent on the issue of duty to care during communicable disease outbreaks, thus providing no guidance on what is expected of HCPs or how they ought to approach their duty to care in the face of risk. DISCUSSION: In the aftermath of SARS and with the spectre of a pandemic avian influenza, it is imperative that we (re)consider the obligations of HCPs for patients with severe infectious diseases, particularly diseases that pose risks to those providing care. It is of pressing importance that organizations representing HCPs give clear indication of what standard of care is expected of their members in the event of a pandemic. In this paper, we address the issue of special obligations of HCPs during an infectious disease outbreak. We argue that there is a pressing need to clarify the rights and responsibilities of HCPs in the current context of pandemic flu preparedness, and that these rights and responsibilities ought to be codified in professional codes of ethics. Finally, we present a brief historical accounting of the treatment of the duty to care in professional health care codes of ethics. SUMMARY: An honest and critical examination of the role of HCPs during communicable disease outbreaks is needed in order to provide guidelines regarding professional rights and responsibilities, as well as ethical duties and obligations. With this paper, we hope to open the social dialogue and advance the public debate on this increasingly urgent issue.","publish_time":"2006-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruderman, Carly; Tracy, C Shawn; Bensimon, C\u00E9cile M; Bernstein, Mark; Hawryluck, Laura; Shaul, Randi Zlotnik; Upshur, Ross EG","journal":"BMC Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1b6c2b3b808e995697f94d9676d5d5c85180177.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1459179.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1459179/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["responsibilities of HCPs","health care systems","role of HCPs","Health care professionals","standard of care","clinical care","professional health care codes of ethics","issue of special obligations of HCPs","public health","professional rights","professional codes of ethics","issue of duty","SARS outbreak","aftermath of SARS","communicable disease outbreaks","infectious disease outbreak","World Health Organization figures","urgent issue","paper","severe infectious diseases","pandemic avian influenza","hospital systems","public debate","pressing importance","pressing need","face of risk","current context of pandemic flu preparedness","serious risk of morbidity","order","clear indication","critical examination","organizations","spectre","patients","skills","mortality","treatment","brunt","guidelines","governance structures","vulnerabilities","personal commitment","brief historical accounting","expertise","SUMMARY","social dialogue","number of commentators","ethical duties","members","risks","challenge","guidance","Unprecedented demands","BACKGROUND","event","reported cases","DISCUSSION","crisis","infection"],"language":"en"},

An exacerbation is an event defined in terms of subjective descriptors or symptoms, namely dyspnoea, cough and sputum that worsen sufficiently to warrant a change in medical management. There is a need for reliable markers that reflect the pathological mechanisms that underlie exacerbation severity and that can be used as a surrogate to assess treatment effects in clinical studies. Little is known as to how existing study variables and suggested markers change in both the stable and exacerbation phases of COPD. In an attempt to find the best surrogates for exacerbations, we have reviewed the literature to identify which of these markers change in a consistent manner with the severity of the exacerbation event. METHODS: We have searched standard databases between 1966 to July 2004 using major keywords and terms. Studies that provided demographics, spirometry, potential markers, and clear eligibility criteria were included in this study. Central tendencies and dispersions for all the variables and markers reported and collected by us were first tabulated according to sample size and ATS/ERS 2004 Exacerbation Severity Levels I to III criteria. Due to the possible similarity of patients in Levels II and III, the data was also redefined into categories of exacerbations, namely out-patient (Level I) and in-patient (Levels II \u0026 III combined). For both approaches, we performed a fixed effect meta-analysis on each of the reported variables. RESULTS: We included a total of 268 studies reported between 1979 to July 2004. These studies investigated 142,407 patients with COPD. Arterial carbon dioxide tension and breathing rate were statistically different between all levels of exacerbation severity and between in out- and in-patient settings. Most other measures showed weak relationships with either level or setting, or they had insufficient data to permit meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Arterial carbon dioxide and breathing rate varied in a consistent manner with exacerbation severity and patient setting. Many other measures showed weak correlations that should be further explored in future longitudinal studies or assessed using suggested mathematical modelling techniques.","publish_time":"2006-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franciosi, Luigi G; Page, Clive P; Celli, Bartolome R; Cazzola, Mario; Walker, Michael J; Danhof, Meindert; Rabe, Klaus F; Pasqua, Oscar E Della","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/babad3896fca8ed7c89d9b785c08e7c42a48a6a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1481583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1481583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","ATS/ERS","III","Levels II \u0026 III"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of exacerbation severity","Exacerbation Severity Levels","exacerbation event","exacerbation phases of COPD","suggested markers","potential markers","reliable markers","clinical studies","reported variables","change","future longitudinal studies","rate","consistent manner","existing study variables","measures","Arterial carbon dioxide tension","possible similarity of patients","fixed effect meta-analysis","weak relationships","insufficient data","categories of exacerbations","weak correlations","in-patient settings","clear eligibility criteria","terms of subjective descriptors","suggested mathematical modelling techniques","ATS","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","dyspnoea","symptoms","spirometry","pathological mechanisms","BACKGROUND","treatment effects","dispersions","demographics","sample size","cough","best surrogates","CONCLUSION","Central tendencies","METHODS","standard databases","attempt","sputum","approaches","major keywords","medical management","exacerbations\u0027","total","need","literature","conditions","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Macrophage-like synoviocytes and FLS expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their interaction has aroused great interest. The present article studied the expression of CD147, also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer, on monocytes/macrophages and FLS from RA patients and its potential role in enhancing MMPs and the invasiveness of synoviocytes. Expression of CD147 on FLS derived from RA patients and from osteoarthritis patients, and expression of CD147 on monocytes/macrophages from rheumatic synovial fluid and healthy peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of CD147, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA in FLS were detected by RT-PCR. The role of CD147 in MMP production and the cells\u0027 invasiveness in vitro were studied by the co-culture of FLS with the human THP-1 cell line or monocytes/macrophages, by gel zymography and by invasion assay. The results showed that the expression of CD147 was higher on RA FLS than on osteoarthritis FLS and was higher on monocytes/macrophages from rheumatic synovial fluid than on monocytes/macrophages from healthy peripheral blood. RT-PCR showed that the expressions of CD147, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA was higher in RA FLS than in osteoarthritis FLS. A significantly elevated secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were observed in RA FLS co-cultured with differentiated THP-1 cells or RA synovial monocytes/macrophages, compared with those co-cultured with undifferentiated THP-1 cells or healthy control peripheral blood monocytes. Invasion assays showed an increased number of invading cells in the co-cultured RA FLS with differentiated THP-1 cells or RA synovial monocytes/macrophages. CD147 antagonistic peptide inhibited the MMP production and the invasive potential. Our studies demonstrated that the CD147 overexpression on monocytes/macrophages and FLS in RA patients may be responsible for the enhanced MMP secretion and activation and for the invasiveness of synoviocytes. These findings suggest that CD147 may be one of the important factors in progressive joint destruction of RA and that CD147 may be a potential therapeutic target in RA treatment.","publish_time":"2006-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Ping; Lu, Ning; Shi, Zhan-guo; Zhou, Jun; Wu, Zhen-biao; Yang, Yong; Ding, Jin; Chen, Zhi-nan","journal":"Arthritis Res Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02b8dea56378d11fe92d6a60ff37a34b0d6ea63e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1526600.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1526600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RA","MMP","RA FLS","FLS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RA synovial monocytes","macrophages","RA patients","RA FLS co-cultured","co-cultured RA FLS","osteoarthritis FLS","expression of CD147","RA treatment","role of CD147","co-culture of FLS","CD147 overexpression","expressions of CD147","levels of CD147","MMP production","activation of MMP","FLS expression of matrix metalloproteinases","CD147 antagonistic peptide","enhanced MMP secretion","invasiveness of synoviocytes","healthy control peripheral blood monocytes","progressive joint destruction of RA","osteoarthritis patients","healthy peripheral blood","rheumatic synovial fluid","human THP","undifferentiated THP","potential role","increased number of invading cells","active cells of rheumatoid arthritis","MMPs","invasive potential","cells\u0027 invasiveness","mRNA","RT-PCR","potential therapeutic target","elevated secretion","Invasion assays","articular cartilage","extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer","important factors","gel zymography","cell line","fibroblast","flow cytometry","interaction","position","present article","studies","results","findings"],"language":"en"},

Equipped with transmembranous and cytosolic pathogen-sensing pattern recognition receptors the epithelium detects invading pathogens. A complex signalling results in epithelial cell activation, which essentially participates in initiation and orchestration of the subsequent innate and adaptive immune response. In this review we summarize recent progress in research focussing on molecular mechanisms of pathogen detection, host cell signal transduction, and subsequent activation of lung epithelial cells by pathogens and their virulence factors and point to open questions.

Using rotavirus as a model system, we developed a cell-based, moderate-throughput screening (MTS) assay to identify compounds that reduce rotavirus infectivity in vitro, toward a long-term goal of discovering immunomodulatory agents that enhance innate responses to viral infection. RESULTS: A natural product library consisting of 280 compounds was screened in the assay and 15 compounds that significantly reduced infectivity without cytotoxicity were identified. Time course analysis of four compounds with previously characterized effects on inflammatory gene expression inhibited replication with pre-treatment times as minimal as 2 hours. Two of these four compounds, \u03B1-mangostin and 18-\u03B2-glycyrrhetinic acid, activated NF\u03BAB and induced IL-8 secretion. The assay is adaptable to other virus systems, and amenable to full automation and adaptation to a high-throughput format.

The global SARS experience has taught us that ethical frameworks to guide decision-making may help to reduce collateral damage and increase trust and solidarity within and between health care organisations. Good pandemic planning requires reflection on values because science alone cannot tell us how to prepare for a public health crisis. DISCUSSION: In this paper, we present an ethical framework for pandemic influenza planning. The ethical framework was developed with expertise from clinical, organisational and public health ethics and validated through a stakeholder engagement process. The ethical framework includes both substantive and procedural elements for ethical pandemic influenza planning. The incorporation of ethics into pandemic planning can be helped by senior hospital administrators sponsoring its use, by having stakeholders vet the framework, and by designing or identifying decision review processes. We discuss the merits and limits of an applied ethical framework for hospital decision-making, as well as the robustness of the framework. SUMMARY: The need for reflection on the ethical issues raised by the spectre of a pandemic influenza outbreak is great. Our efforts to address the normative aspects of pandemic planning in hospitals have generated interest from other hospitals and from the governmental sector. The framework will require re-evaluation and refinement and we hope that this paper will generate feedback on how to make it even more robust.","publish_time":"2006-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Alison K; Faith, Karen; Gibson, Jennifer L; Upshur, Ross EG","journal":"BMC Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12de3563e18c3c6c5943fa8216e0eea970a590cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1698926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1698926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ethical pandemic influenza planning","applied ethical framework","Good pandemic planning","pandemic influenza outbreak","ethical issues","ethical frameworks","normative aspects of pandemic planning","hospitals","public health ethics","reflection","hospital decision-making","public health crisis","paper","health care organisations","incorporation of ethics","senior hospital administrators","procedural elements","solidarity","values","expertise","spectre","use","collateral damage","trust","need","limits","stakeholder engagement process","global SARS experience","merits","refinement","science","decision review processes","efforts","SUMMARY","governmental sector","world","re-evaluation","stakeholders","robustness","BACKGROUND","DISCUSSION","feedback"],"language":"en"},

This is the thirteenth of a series of 16 reviews that have been prepared as background for advice from the WHO Advisory Committee on Health Research to WHO on how to achieve this. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the literature on applicability, transferability, and adaptation of guidelines. METHODS: We searched five databases for existing systematic reviews and relevant primary methodological research. We reviewed the titles of all citations and retrieved abstracts and full text articles if the citations appeared relevant to the topic. We checked the reference lists of articles relevant to the questions and used snowballing as a technique to obtain additional information. We used the definition \u0022coming from, concerning or belonging to at least two or all nations\u0022 for the term international. Our conclusions are based on the available evidence, consideration of what WHO and other organisations are doing and logical arguments. KEY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: We did not identify systematic reviews addressing the key questions. We found individual studies and projects published in the peer reviewed literature and on the Internet. Should WHO develop international recommendations? \u2022 Resources for developing high quality recommendations are limited. Internationally developed recommendations can facilitate access to and pooling of resources, reduce unnecessary duplication, and involve international scientists. \u2022 Priority should be given to international health problems and problems that are important in low and middle-income countries, where these advantages are likely to be greatest. \u2022 Factors that influence the transferability of recommendations across different settings should be considered systematically and flagged, including modifying factors, important variation in needs, values, costs and the availability of resources. What should be done centrally and locally? \u2022 The preparation of systematic reviews and evidence profiles should be coordinated centrally, in collaboration with organizations that produce systematic reviews. Centrally developed evidence profiles should be adaptable to specific local circumstances. \u2022 Consideration should be given to models that involve central coordination with work being undertaken by centres located throughout the world. \u2022 While needs, availability of resources, costs, the presence of modifying factors and values need to be assessed locally, support for undertaking these assessments may be needed to make guidelines applicable. \u2022 WHO should provide local support for adapting and implementing recommendations by developing tools, building capacity, learning from international experience, and through international networks that support evidence-informed health policies, such as the Evidence-informed Policy Network (EVIPNet). How should recommendations be adapted? \u2022 WHO should provide detailed guidance for adaptation of international recommendations. \u2022 Local adaptation processes should be systematic and transparent, they should involve stakeholders, and they should report the key factors that influence decisions, including those flagged in international guidelines, and the reasons for any modifications that are made.","publish_time":"2006-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00FCnemann, Holger J; Fretheim, Atle; Oxman, Andrew D","journal":"Health Res Policy Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c878b060760db3b59ae0129a5de677e56a30866e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1712227.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1712227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO Advisory Committee","Evidence-informed Policy Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adaptation of international recommendations","international guidelines","international health problems","transferability of recommendations","developed recommendations","health care recommendations","international networks","international experience","international scientists","term international","available evidence","Health Research","evidence-informed health policies","existing systematic reviews","preparation of systematic reviews","key factors","developed evidence profiles","high quality recommendations","best available research evidence","World Health Organization","availability of resources","adaptation of guidelines","KEY QUESTIONS","modifying factors","local support","Evidence-informed Policy Network","Local adaptation processes","pooling of resources","relevant primary methodological research","costs","citations","values","BACKGROUND","needs","peer reviewed literature","organisations","consideration","guidelines applicable","reference lists of articles relevant","specific local circumstances","important variation","text articles","rigorous processes","retrieved abstracts","projects","unnecessary duplication","databases","Advisory Committee","models","countries","technique","snowballing","EVIPNet","capacity","access","presence","detailed guidance","central coordination","advantages","advice","titles","centres","Internet","applicability","different settings","reasons","collaboration","organizations","ANSWERS","decisions","additional information","individual studies","logical arguments","topic","nations","tools","assessments","conclusions","Priority","modifications","stakeholders","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","series","definition"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents. A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs. We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice. To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV. icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain. Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013challenged mice. VRP-N\u2013induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations. The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2006-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deming, Damon; Sheahan, Timothy; Heise, Mark; Yount, Boyd; Davis, Nancy; Sims, Amy; Suthar, Mehul; Harkema, Jack; Whitmore, Alan; Pickles, Raymond; West, Ande; Donaldson, Eric; Curtis, Kristopher; Johnston, Robert; Baric, Ralph","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29b6131c0d572d383cbc6774b12e4471aa612b07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1716185.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1716185/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV vaccine","heterologous SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV virus","zoonotic SARS-CoV","VRP-S vaccines","lungs of SARS","VRP vaccine efficacy","VRP-N vaccines","future SARS-CoV zoonosis","heterologous icGD03-S challenge","heterologous challenge","heterologous S glycoproteins","icGDO3-S","senescent mice","epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike","young mice","homologous strain challenge","zoonotic virus","comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy","synthetic S glycoprotein gene","Urbani strain","zoonotic strains","long-term protection","lungs of young","vaccine design","vulnerable senescent populations","day","divergent human strain","limited protection","chimeric virus","epidemic strains","complete short-term protection","robust challenge inoculum","vaccinated senescent animals","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe pneumonia","etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","likely source of future outbreaks","vulnerable elderly populations","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles","synthetic biology","species barrier","human airway epithelial cells","domestic cats","civets","raccoon dogs","disease","clusters","reverse genetics","swine","FINDINGS","gaps","challenges","enhanced immunopathology","eosinophilic infiltrates","phylogenetic analyses","study","antisera","induced pathology","nucleocapsid","rodents","METHODS","bats","neutralization","availability","cellular immune responses","CONCLUSIONS","death","BACKGROUND","animal reservoirs"],"language":"en"},

ISG15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type I interferon. ISG15 can be covalently attached to proteins, analogous to ubiquitination and with actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors. Specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or UbLs by hydrolyzing the covalent bond between their C-termini and substrate proteins. The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15. RESULTS: We have cloned and expressed 22 human DUBs, representing the major clades of the USP protease family. Utilizing suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and ISG15, we have identified USP2, USP5 (IsoT1), USP13 (IsoT3), and USP14 as ISG15-reactive proteases, in addition to the bona fide ISG15-specific protease USP18 (UBP43). USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB, and its ISG15 isopeptidase activity increases when complexed with the proteasome. CONCLUSIONS: By evolutionary standards, ISG15 is a newcomer among the UbLs and it apparently not only utilizes the conjugating but also the deconjugating machinery of its more established relative ubiquitin. Functional overlap between these two posttranslational modifiers might therefore be more extensive than previously appreciated and explain the rather innocuous phenotype of ISG15 null mice.","publish_time":"2007-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Catic, Andr\u00E9; Fiebiger, Edda; Korbel, Gregory A.; Blom, Dani\u00EBl; Galardy, Paul J.; Ploegh, Hidde L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8309dc172cf91ff580779bbc1394a9692b798a86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1919423.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1919423/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["family of ubiquitin","homolog of ubiquitin","ISG15-reactive proteases","ISG15-specific protease USP18","established relative ubiquitin","tail regions of ubiquitin","ISG15 isopeptidase activity increases","UbLs","innocuous phenotype of ISG15 null mice","actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors","Specific proteases","USP14","USP protease family","promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases","functional similarity","human DUBs","Functional overlap","substrate proteins","proteasome-associated DUB","major clades","C-termini","ubiquitination","modification","addition","deconjugating machinery","covalent bond","IsoT1","posttranslational modifiers","USP13","sequence","vertebrates","evolutionary standards","IsoT3","newcomer","UBP43","molecules","capable of recognizing","following induction","USP5","members","USP2","CONCLUSIONS","suicide inhibitors","interferon","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The output is an alignment where for each pattern (constraint), an occurrence on each sequence can be found aligned together with those on the other sequences, in a manner that the overall alignment is optimized. Its predecessor, MuSiC, has been found useful by researchers since its release in 2004. However, it is noticed in applications that the pattern formulation adopted in MuSiC, namely, plain strings allowing mismatches, is not expressive and flexible enough. The constraint formulation adopted in RE-MuSiC is therefore enhanced to be regular expressions, which is convenient in expressing many biologically significant patterns like those collected in the PROSITE database, or structural consensuses that often involve variable ranges between conserved parts.

GHQ-12 was scored by binary, chronic and Likert scoring method. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to reveal the factor structure of GHQ-12. Categorical regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between various background factors and GHQ-12 scores. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the model consisting of the two factors and using chronic method gave the best goodness-of-fit among the various models for factor structure. Recovery in the scale for the factor \u0027social dysfunction\u0027 was remarkably impaired compared with that of the factor \u0027dysphoria\u0027.

The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.","publish_time":"2007-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fraser, Christophe","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6eed04e43ad653c06247b10ab05d03bdccf04bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1950082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["household reproduction number","infected household","individual reproduction number","number of households","household transmission","number of people","estimating reproduction numbers","real time","tracking infectious disease outbreaks","central role","future infectious disease mitigation","key role","impact of measures","tracking individuals","historical data","numerical simulations","limited data","micro-simulations","outbreak dynamics","model of transmission","current thinking","estimates","vaccination","social distancing","spread of influenza","workplace closures","measles","prophylactic treatment","school","quarantine","point","isolation","typical case","would-be emerging epidemics","methods","state","new estimator","averages","paper","viruses","potential benefits","aim"],"language":"en"},

Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results.","publish_time":"2007-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dawson, Wayne K.; Fujiwara, Kazuya; Kawai, Gota","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb77f295f754abf6a7e99a90dad5626180c5b177.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8d14b700a065187eb4d8b01e0e9b6e3e37e5d09b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/898be097851a56d857d6cdb8ccbbdd3666eb4963.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1975678.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1975678/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structure of RNA","RNA secondary structure","RNA pseudoknot prediction","structure mapping","biological RNA molecules","functional RNA sequences","folded structure","proper folding","folding direction","neglecting pseudoknots","Prediction approaches","hierarchical folding hypothesis","Mapping methods","better results","known pseudoknot structures","thermodynamics","minimum free energy","information","contact order model","time complexity","study","step","D structural considerations","problem","future","flexibility","utility","algorithm","heuristic approach","advantage","program","directions"],"language":"en"},

HRV infections cause a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory symptoms. Defining the role of specific strains in various HRV illnesses has been difficult because traditional serology, which requires viral culture and neutralization tests using 101 serotype-specific antisera, is insensitive and laborious. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To directly type HRVs in nasal secretions of infants with frequent respiratory illnesses, we developed a sensitive molecular typing assay based on phylogenetic comparisons of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5\u0027 noncoding region with homologous sequences of the 101 known serotypes. Nasal samples from 26 infants were first tested with a multiplex PCR assay for respiratory viruses, and HRV was the most common virus found (108 of 181 samples). Typing was completed for 101 samples and 103 HRVs were identified. Surprisingly, 54 (52.4%) HRVs did not match any of the known serotypes and had 12\u201335% nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference HRVs. Of these novel viruses, 9 strains (17 HRVs) segregated from HRVA, HRVB and human enterovirus into a distinct genetic group (\u201CC\u201D). None of these new strains could be cultured in traditional cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: By molecular analysis, over 50% of HRV detected in sick infants were previously unrecognized strains, including 9 strains that may represent a new HRV group. These findings indicate that the number of HRV strains is considerably larger than the 101 serotypes identified with traditional diagnostic techniques, and provide evidence of a new HRV group.","publish_time":"2007-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Wai-Ming; Kiesner, Christin; Pappas, Tressa; Lee, Iris; Grindle, Kris; Jartti, Tuomas; Jakiela, Bogdan; Lemanske, Robert F.; Shult, Peter A.; Gern, James E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1f82bd6a621efe50dc1888f875c82c7d948a547.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1989136.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1989136/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of HRV strains","new strains","new HRV group","HRV infections","unrecognized strains","various HRV illnesses","role of specific strains","known serotypes","nearest reference HRVs","respiratory viruses","Nasal samples","frequent respiratory illnesses","traditional serology","human enterovirus","nasal secretions of infants","sick infants","Human rhinoviruses","FINDINGS","sensitive molecular typing assay","traditional diagnostic techniques","distinct genetic group","traditional cell lines","prevalent human pathogens","severe lower respiratory symptoms","molecular analysis","novel viruses","sequence variations","serotype-specific antisera","multiplex PCR assay","bp variable sequence","asymptomatic infection","phylogenetic comparisons","wide spectrum of clinical outcomes","evidence","neutralization tests","viral culture","homologous sequences","HRVB","noncoding region","nucleotide divergence","HRVA","groups","BACKGROUND","common virus","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) gene family codes for such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species-specific variation between human and rodents. Since little is known about the CEA gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analyzing the CEA family of the dog. RESULTS: Here we describe the complete CEA gene family in the dog. We found that the gene coding for the ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice. However, while the murine and human CEACAMs (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules) are predominantly secreted and GPI-anchored, respectively, in the dog, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins. One of these proteins, CEACAM28, exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding N domain of CEACAM1, but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs. In addition, CEACAM28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as CEACAM1. However, upon activation CEACAM28 mRNA and CEACAM1 mRNA are differentially regulated. CONCLUSION: Thus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 are the first paired immune receptors identified within the CEA gene family, which are expressed on T cells and are most likely involved in the fine-tuning of T cell responses. The direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the possibility that CEACAM28 evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species-specific pathogens.","publish_time":"2007-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kammerer, Robert; Popp, Tanja; H\u00E4rtle, Stefan; Singer, Bernhard B; Zimmermann, Wolfgang","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a0f0170d5ad8bb5c0f2af642c0fc37e48dbd3a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2110893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2110893/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["canine CEA gene family","complete CEA gene family","gene family codes","diverging CEA family","gene duplication","gene coding","immune cells","CEACAM1 mRNA","immune responses","CEACAM28 N domain","direction of gene conversion","canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs","activation CEACAM28 mRNA","dog","paired immune receptors","immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1","human CEACAMs","species-specific pathogens","transmembrane proteins","T cells","ligand-binding N domain of CEACAM1","mammalian immune system","impact of pathogens","fine-tuning of T cell responses","carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules","similar expression pattern","strongest purifying selection","driven host evolution","cellular receptors","complete sequence identity","tremendous species-specific variation","recent expansion","synonymous substitutions","rise","selective pressure","ITIM","possibility","forefront of pathogen","lineages of placental mammals","rodents","debate","tissues","Comparison of nonsynonymous","motifs","ITAM","addition","new insights","cytoplasmic tail","GPI","humans","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","mice","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Combinations of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis and thereby survival. We therefore compared the diagnostic characteristics of novel and routinely used biomarkers of sepsis alone and in combination. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who were suspected of having community-acquired infections. It was conducted in a medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases at a university hospital. A multiplex immunoassay measuring soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM)-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was used in parallel with standard measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and neutrophils. Two composite markers were constructed \u2013 one including a linear combination of the three best performing markers and another including all six \u2013 and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare their performance and those of the individual markers. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 96 had bacterial infections. The AUCs for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation were 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.60) for suPAR, 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) for sTREM-1, 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.72) for MIF, 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.79) for PCT, 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.81) for neutrophil count, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) for CRP, 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91) for the composite three-marker test, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) for the composite six-marker test. The AUC of the six-marker test was significantly greater than that of the single markers. CONCLUSION: Combining information from several markers improves diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation. Measurements of suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF had limited value as single markers, whereas PCT and CRP exhibited acceptable diagnostic characteristics.

This cross-reactivity is sometimes predictable, such as between lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Pichinde virus, where cross-reactive epitopes share six out of eight amino acids. Here, however, we demonstrate more subtle and less predictable cross-reactivity between LCMV and the unrelated vaccinia virus (VV). Epitope-specific T cell receptor usage differed between individual LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice, even though the mice had similar epitope-specific T cell hierarchies. LCMV-immune mice challenged with VV showed variations, albeit in a distinct hierarchy, in proliferative expansions of and down-regulation of IL-7R\u03B1 by T cells specific to different LCMV epitopes. T cell responses to a VV-encoded epitope that is cross-reactive with LCMV fluctuated greatly in VV-infected LCMV-immune mice. Adoptive transfers of splenocytes from individual LCMV-immune donors resulted in nearly identical VV-induced responses in each of several recipients, but responses differed depending on the donor. This indicates that the specificities of T cell responses that are not shared between individuals may influence cross-reactivity with other antigens and play roles in heterologous immunity upon encounter with another pathogen. This variability in cross-reactive T cell expansion that is unique to the individual may underlie variation in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2005-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Sung-Kwon; Cornberg, Markus; Wang, Xiaoting Z.; Chen, Hong D.; Selin, Liisa K.; Welsh, Raymond M.","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c761570812ca07ce01397ebabc220556f51e786e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2213046.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2213046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LCMV","VV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specificities of T cell responses","VV-infected LCMV-immune mice","CD8 T cell cross-reactivity","cross-reactive T cell expansion","individual LCMV-immune donors","T cells specific","different LCMV epitopes","Epitope-specific T cell receptor usage","individual LCMV-infected C57BL","similar epitope-specific T cell hierarchies","predictable cross-reactivity","VV-encoded epitope","identical VV-induced responses","cross-reactive epitopes","roles","Pichinde virus","protective heterologous immunity","unrelated vaccinia virus","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","viruses","R\u03B1","variations","antigens","Adoptive transfers of splenocytes","damaging immunopathology","proliferative expansions","distinct hierarchy","regulation of IL","encounter","variability","pathogenesis of infectious diseases","recipients","individuals","amino acids"],"language":"en"},

LACV is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America and infects up to 300,000 persons each year of which 70\u2013130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system (CNS). As an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development, we examined LACV infectivity, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys. RESULTS: Following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice, LACV replicated in various organs before reaching the CNS where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease. The peripheral site where LACV replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates, and, presumably, LACV can enter the CNS via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium. The mouse infectious dose(50 )and lethal dose(50 )was similar for LACV administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally. LACV was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 PFU. However, the infection was asymptomatic, and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response. CONCLUSION: In mice, LACV likely gains access to the CNS via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons. The ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that LACV might use this route to infect its natural hosts. Rhesus monkeys are susceptible to LACV infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 PFU. Mice and rhesus monkeys are useful animal models for LACV vaccine immunologic testing although the rhesus monkey model is not optimal.","publish_time":"2008-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bennett, Richard S; Cress, Christina M; Ward, Jerrold M; Firestone, Cai-Yen; Murphy, Brian R; Whitehead, Stephen S","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/050e73f86cfa4ab3f3fc84b0cb55ac779fb9abc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2276200.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2276200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LACV","CNS"],"locations":["Wisconsin","North America"],"keyphrases":["LACV infection","LACV replicates","LACV infectivity","rhesus monkeys","LACV vaccine immunologic testing","CNS","weanling mice","intraperitoneal inoculation of mice","olfactory neurons","rhesus monkey model","nasal olfactory epithelium","PFU","establishment of useful animal models","strong neutralizing antibody responses","mouse infectious dose","vaccine development","highest titer","high titer","fatal encephalitis","severe disease","neurological disease","Crosse virus","nasal turbinates","lethal dose","major cause of pediatric encephalitis","immunogenicity","central nervous system","North America","year-old girl","peripheral site","blood stream","isolation","death","route","pathogenesis","various organs","access","initial step","family Bunyaviridae","Wisconsin","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","possibility","human pathogen","natural hosts","persons","animals","CONCLUSION","ability"],"language":"en"},

The positive sense RNA genome of JV is organised into ORF1 (non-structural proteins), ORF2 (major capsid protein) and ORF3 (minor capsid protein). The lack of a cell culture system for studying JV replication has meant that work to date has relied upon in vitro systems to study non-structural protein synthesis and processing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Only two of the three major ORF1 proteins were identified (p110 and 2C) following in vitro translation of JV RNA, the N-term protein was not detected. The N-term encoding genomic sequence (5\u2032GS) was tested for IRES-like function in a bi-cistronic system and displayed no evidence of IRES-like activity. The site of translation initiation in JV was determined to be at the predicted nucleotide 22. Following the insertion of an epitope within the 5\u2032GS the JV N-term protein was identified in vitro and within RNA transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro transcription/translation system is currently the best system for analysing protein synthesis and processing in JV. Unlike similarly studied human noroviruses JV initially did not appear to express the N-terminal protein, presenting the possibility that the encoding RNA sequence had a regulatory function, most likely involved in translation initiation in an IRES-like manner. This was not the case and, following determination of the site of translation initiation the N-term protein was detected using an epitope tag, both in vitro and in vivo. Although slightly larger than predicted the N-term protein was detected in a processed form in vivo, thus not only demonstrating initial translation of the ORF1 polyprotein but also activity of the viral protease. These findings indicate that the block to noroviral replication in cultured cells lies elsewhere.","publish_time":"2008-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salim, Omar; Clarke, Ian N.; Lambden, Paul R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/702d0144bdeae0782bbebcbe41d432fa7ae41415.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2364642.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2364642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","JV","JV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JV N-term protein","translation of JV RNA","N-terminal protein","translation system","JV replication","major capsid protein","non-structural protein synthesis","analysing protein synthesis","minor capsid protein","site of translation initiation","initial translation","human noroviruses JV","positive sense RNA genome of JV","encoding RNA sequence","best system","major ORF1 proteins","RNA transfected cells","cell culture system","bi-cistronic system","ORF1 polyprotein","non-structural proteins","processing","evidence of IRES","activity","study of enteric norovirus infection","enteric disease","noroviral replication","bovine Norovirus","regulatory function","genomic sequence","cultured cells","epitope tag","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","predicted nucleotide","ORF2","ORF3","cattle","potential model","block","possibility","pathogenesis","p110","systems","determination","Jena Virus","date","lack","BACKGROUND","work","transcription","viral protease","processed form","CONCLUSIONS","manner","case","insertion"],"language":"en"},

Here, we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic (LP) viruses. Mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent H5N1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity, lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics. Interestingly, while these similarities were observed, the HP H5N1 virus consistently elicited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in whole lungs and primary human macrophages, revealing a potentially critical difference in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infections. These results together show that infection with HP influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs, suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with HP influenza virus infection.

Government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties. This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: Data were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups. Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: In total, 2760 people participated in this study. Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 \u003E 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population. Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.57\u20132.55; p \u003C 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.36\u20132.46; p \u003C 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones). Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally. Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications. Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.82\u20132.73; p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately. However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza.","publish_time":"2008-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Melanie R; Agho, Kingsley E; Stevens, Garry J; Raphael, Beverley","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/357f5b1caf114fdb8a60870473af88bc9017bf14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2571100.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2571100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kessler"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["psychological distress data","Psychological Distress Scale","prevalence of high psychological distress","elevated levels of psychological distress","high levels of non-specific psychological distress","greater risk of high psychological distress","study","disease outbreak","potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases","high risk infection","affected population","disease buffer","horse-related industry","white zones","Government disease control measures","target population","infected EI zones","Statistical analysis","number of industry groups","respondents","horse-owners","Australian general population","primary source of income","principal source of income","infectious equine influenza","lower levels of formal educational qualifications","certain groups","younger people","pandemic influenza","backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis","psycho-social impacts","States","link","main outcome measure","movement restrictions","Kessler","good internal validity","generalisability","online survey","place","factors","K10","properties","RESULTS","total","paper","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, antiviral drugs are not completely harmless, and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large-scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown. We provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs. Throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own, rational decisions. To this end we investigate the conditions under which a large-scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic, and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment. This enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis, and the transmissibility of the pathogen. Our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective. In particular, when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen, for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible. It is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal, while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2008-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Boven, Michiel; Klinkenberg, Don; Pen, Ido; Weissing, Franz J.; Heesterbeek, Hans","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26670350d15f4a1f0a7072ad985d98b21c28fd5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2592701.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2592701/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral control strategy","antiviral prophylaxis","Antiviral agents","cost of antiviral treatment","efficacy of antiviral drugs","individual antiviral drug treatment","large-scale antiviral control program","large-scale antiviral drug treatment program","optimal control strategy","public health perspective","game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs","aggressive control","risk of infection","risk of mortality","emerging pathogen","situation","conditions","individuals","process of individual choice","unfolding epidemic","prevention of emerging viral diseases","H5N1 avian influenza","population dynamical","SARS","considerable promise","transmissibility","investigation","rational decisions","strong incentive","end"],"language":"en"},

The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses. METHODS: We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20% of the population.","publish_time":"2009-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arino, Julien; Bowman, Christopher S; Moghadas, Seyed M","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5505b3b82076cc533a5be93b32e0c8ca91ee861.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8835dcab677bd9b99cb9f75095332a92b53e1caa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2653495.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653495/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high treatment levels","scale treatment","conservative treatment levels","antiviral strategy","onset of aggressive treatment","treatment of clinical infections","influenza pandemic","pandemic plans","pandemic potential","stockpiling antiviral drugs","use of available stockpiles","scale of drug","development of drug resistance","outbreak","RESULTS","population","anticipated extent of antiviral use","effective pandemic responses","strategic use of drugs","low levels","limited stockpiles","effective strategy","outcome of different antiviral strategies","sensitive strain","various sizes of stockpiles","rapid depletion of stockpiles","run","transmissible resistant strains","timely implementation of wide","timely increase","mathematical model","early stages","wave of infections","planning","major public health concern","significant impact","adverse consequences","reproduction number","virus","published literature","emergence","estimated parameters","BACKGROUND","findings","final size","METHODS","CONCLUSION","larger magnitude"],"language":"en"},

Existing standardised health classifications do not capture important dimensions of public health, which include its functions, the methods and interventions used to achieve these, the health issues and determinants of health that public health activities address, the resources and infrastructure they use, and the settings in which they occur. A classification that describes these dimensions will promote consistency in collecting and reporting information about public health programs, expenditure, workforce and performance. This paper describes the development of an initial version of such a classification. METHODS: We used open-source Prot\u00E9g\u00E9 software and published procedures to construct an ontology of public health, which forms the basis of the classification. We reviewed existing definitions of public health, descriptions of public health functions and classifications to develop the scope, domain, and multidimensional class structure of the ontology. These were then refined through a series of consultations with public health experts from across Australia, culminating in an initial classification framework. RESULTS: The public health classification consists of six top-level classes: public health \u0027Functions\u0027; \u0027Health Issues\u0027; \u0027Determinants of Health\u0027; \u0027Settings\u0027; \u0027Methods\u0027 of intervention; and \u0027Resources and Infrastructure\u0027. Existing classifications (such as the international classifications of diseases, disability and functioning and external causes of injuries) can be used to further classify large parts of the classes \u0027Health Issues\u0027, \u0027Settings\u0027 and \u0027Resources and Infrastructure\u0027, while new subclass structures are proposed for the classes of public health \u0027Functions\u0027, \u0027Determinants of Health\u0027 and \u0027Interventions\u0027. CONCLUSION: The public health classification captures the important dimensions of public health activity. It will facilitate the organisation of information so that it can be used to address questions relating to any of these dimensions, either singly or in combination. The authors encourage readers to use the classification, and to suggest improvements.","publish_time":"2009-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jorm, Louisa; Gruszin, Su; Churches, Tim","journal":"Aust New Zealand Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3a619c91ee061e4a50ea321474c66e5eb3fd39e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e0e72a30a878927eed9b8a35a003b4fc38afb44d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2674448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2674448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["public health classification","classes of public health","ontology of public health","public health programs","public health experts","determinants of health","Health Issues\u0027","existing definitions of public health","descriptions of public health functions","public health activities address","important dimensions of public health activity","Existing standardised health classifications","Existing classifications","initial classification framework","resources","infrastructure","top-level classes","Functions\u0027","international classifications of diseases","Settings\u0027","reporting information","initial version","organisation of information","published procedures","expenditure","open-source Prot\u00E9g\u00E9 software","disability","domain","scope","workforce","countries","limited ability","multidimensional class structure","Australia","new subclass structures","series of consultations","jurisdictions","Methods\u0027 of intervention","large parts","external causes of injuries","present","performance","development","consistency","basis","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","paper","authors","readers","Interventions\u0027","BACKGROUND","differences","questions","combination","improvements"],"language":"en"},

The cytoplasmic nuclease domain of Ire1 cleaves the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding XBP-1 (X-box\u2013binding protein 1), enabling splicing and production of this active transcription factor. We recently showed that Ire1 activation independently induces the rapid turnover of mRNAs encoding membrane and secreted proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells through a pathway we call regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD). In this study, we show that mouse fibroblasts expressing wild-type Ire1 but not an Ire1 variant lacking nuclease activity also degrade mRNAs in response to ER stress. Using a second variant of Ire1 that is activated by a small adenosine triphosphate analogue, we show that although XBP-1 splicing can be artificially induced in the absence of ER stress, RIDD appears to require both Ire1 activity and ER stress.

Nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively, since the simple rule given by Chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex DNA sequence. While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena.","publish_time":"2009-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nandy, Ashesh","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2730015.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene sequences","novel representations of DNA sequences","possibility of intron sequences","sequences of conserved genes","duplex DNA sequence","character representation","undescribed relationship","quadratic distribution relationship","characteristics","normal character-based representation","graphical representations","report","intra-purine","large scale sequence alterations","intra-pyrimidine differences","overview of base distribution","indicative of possible intron-late phenomena","pyrimidines","composition","barrier","monitoring process inbuilt","important role","nucleotides","century","total number of purines","insights","bases","studies","evolutionary time scales","formidable mixing","Chargaff","Nucleotide frequencies","distributions","mutations","relationships","simple rule","hidden structures","apparent order","clue","observation"],"language":"en"},

Of the 16 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of influenza A viruses, only the H5 and H7 subtypes cause highly pathogenic (HP) influenza in the natural hosts. Several duck species are naturally resistant to HP Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. These duck species can shed and spread virus from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts while showing few or no disease signs. While the HP Asian H5N1 viruses are 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry, the absence of disease signs in some duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the \u201CTrojan horses\u201D of H5N1 in their surreptitious spread of virus. An important unresolved issue is whether the HP H5N1 viruses are maintained in the wild duck population of the world. Here, we review the ecology and pathobiology of ducks infected with influenza A viruses and ducks\u2019 role in the maintenance and spread of HP H5N1 viruses. We also identify the key questions about the role of ducks that must be resolved in order to understand the emergence and control of pandemic influenza. It is generally accepted that wild duck species can spread HP H5N1 viruses, but there is insufficient evidence to show that ducks maintain these viruses and transfer them from one generation to the next.","publish_time":"2009-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jeong\u2010Ki; Negovetich, Nicholas J.; Forrest, Heather L.; Webster, Robert G.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f553255dcfe8027bcf53bcb1147a0f8e1ccbe74b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2749972.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2749972/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HP H5N1 viruses","HP Asian H5N1 influenza viruses","HP Asian H5N1 viruses","subtypes of influenza","wild duck species","role of ducks","Abstract Wild ducks","wild duck population","pathobiology of ducks","spread virus","main reservoir of influenza","control of pandemic influenza","surreptitious spread of virus","absence of disease signs","gallinaceous poultry","domestic poultry","H7 subtypes","ducks\u2019 role","maintenance","emergence","chickens","Trojan horses","important unresolved issue","HA","concept","insufficient evidence","mammals","humans","intestinal tracts","order","key questions","hemagglutinin","world","natural hosts","ecology","generation"],"language":"en"},

The number of pathogenic viruses is considerably large and their impact in human global health is well documented. Currently, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has classified \u223C4379 virus species while the National Center for Biotechnology Information Viral Genomes Resource (NCBI-VGR) database has mapped 617 705 proteins to eight large taxonomic groups. Despite these efforts, an automated approach for mapping the ICTV master list and its officially accepted virus naming to the NCBI-VGR\u2019s taxonomical classification is not available. Due to metagenomic sequencing, it is likely that the discovery and naming of new viral species will increase by at least ten fold. Unfortunately, existing viral databases are not adequately prepared to scale, maintain and annotate automatically ultra-high throughput sequences and place this information into specific taxonomic categories. ORION-VIRCAT is a scalable and interoperable object-relational database designed to serve as a resource for the integration and verification of taxonomical classifications generated by the ICTV and NCBI-VGR. The current release (v1.0) of ORION-VIRCAT is implemented in PostgreSQL and it has been extended to ORACLE, MySQL and SyBase. ORION-VIRCAT automatically mapped and joined 617 705 entries from the NCBI-VGR to the viral naming of the ICTV. This detailed analysis revealed that 399 095 entries from the NCBI-VGR can be mapped to the ICTV classification and that one Order, 10 families, 35 genera and 503 species listed in the ICTV disagree with the the NCBI-VGR classification schema. Nevertheless, we were eable to correct several discrepancies mapping 234 000 additional entries.

Dengue recombinant subviral particles have been produced in cell cultures with either modified or chimeric proteins but not using the native forms of prM and E. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have used a codon optimization strategy to obtain an efficient expression of native viral proteins and production of recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) for all four dengue virus (DV) serotypes. A stable HeLa cell line expressing DV1 prME was established (HeLa-prME) and RSPs were analyzed by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. We found that E protein is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where assembly of RSPs could be observed. Biochemical characterization of DV1 RSPs secretion revealed both prM protein cleavage and homodimerization of E proteins before their release into the supernatant, indicating that RSPs undergo a similar maturation process as dengue virus. Pulse chase experiment showed that 8 hours are required for the secretion of DV1 RSPs. We have used HeLa-prME to develop a semi-quantitative assay and screened a human siRNA library targeting genes involved in membrane trafficking. Knockdown of 23 genes resulted in a significant reduction in DV RSP secretion, whereas for 22 others we observed an increase of RSP levels in cell supernatant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data describe the efficient production of RSPs containing native prM and E envelope proteins for all dengue serotypes. Dengue RSPs and corresponding producing cell lines are safe and novel tools that can be used in the study of viral egress as well as in the development of vaccine and drugs against dengue virus.","publish_time":"2009-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Pei-Gang; Kudelko, Mateusz; Lo, Joanne; Siu, Lewis Yu Lam; Kwok, Kevin Tsz Hin; Sachse, Martin; Nicholls, John M.; Bruzzone, Roberto; Altmeyer, Ralf M.; Nal, B\u00E9atrice","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30f0103086a7458f1bdb18024f372814d88a9b4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2790604.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790604/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Flavivirus"],"organizations":["E.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.","publish_time":"2009-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"an der Heiden, Matthias; Buchholz, Udo; Krause, G\u00E9rard; Kirchner, G\u00F6ran; Claus, Hermann; Haas, Walter H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/557a14f4857aab6fa0b5d3b980aa241b113977ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2791869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fraser"],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SEIR"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["epidemic wave","early findings","early phase","pandemic wave","prophylactic treatment","observed number of imported cases","spread","effect of control strategies","early stage","number of treatment courses","novel virus","contacts","two-step control strategy","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","novel influenza","population of Germany","resulting delay","H1N1 pandemic","substantial delay","Necessary doses of antivirals","variation of R0","age distribution","case detection rate","deterministic SEIR model","size","major effects","initial effort","epidemiologic characteristics","countries","sensitivity analysis","quarantine","World Health Organization","impact","Fraser","Science","continents","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","disease","goal","northern hemisphere","measures","cumulative attack rates","METHODOLOGY","peak","populations","country","households","return","end","BACKGROUND","weeks"],"language":"en"},

This case underlines the emergent role which these, often multi-drug resistant, bacteria may play in the future, perhaps in community infections as well.","publish_time":"2009-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kokkonouzis, Ioannis; Christou, Ioannis; Athanasopoulos, Ioannis; Saridis, Nikolaos; Skoufaras, Vasilios","journal":"Cases J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/920acf7b75dd6f84138e5352f7b28aad1973c327.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2804000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["community infections","multiple lung abscesses","presence of lung abscesses","Acinetobacter pneumonia","multiple abscesses","Acinetobacter species","Acinetobacter infection","Acinetobacter stain","presence of lung consolidation","diagnosis of community","case","emergent role","well-known causes of nosocomial infections","fever","sore throat","malaise","productive cough","variety of antimicrobial agents","months","new computed tomography chest scan","yr-old female","radiographic examination","bacteria","multi-drug resistant","uncommon manifestation","patient\u0027s condition","detailed diagnostic work","significant medical history","Recent increasing evidence","future","pathogens","disease","recovery"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we show that IPS-1, the central adaptor protein to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is essential for triggering of innate immunity and for effective development and regulation of adaptive immunity against pathogenic WNV. IPS-1(\u2212/\u2212) mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection marked by enhanced viral replication and dissemination with early viral entry into the CNS. Infection of cultured bone-marrow (BM) derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Macs), and primary cortical neurons showed that the IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling was essential for triggering IFN defenses and controlling virus replication in these key target cells of infection. Intriguingly, infected IPS-1(\u2212/\u2212) mice displayed uncontrolled inflammation that included elevated systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, enhanced humoral responses marked by complete loss of virus neutralization activity, and increased numbers of virus-specific CD8\u002B T cells and non-specific immune cell proliferation in the periphery and in the CNS. This uncontrolled inflammatory response was associated with a lack of regulatory T cell expansion that normally occurs during acute WNV infection. Thus, the enhanced inflammatory response in the absence of IPS-1 was coupled with a failure to protect against WNV infection. Our data define an innate/adaptive immune interface mediated through IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling that regulates the quantity, quality, and balance of the immune response to WNV infection.","publish_time":"2010-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suthar, Mehul S.; Ma, Daphne Y.; Thomas, Sunil; Lund, Jennifer M.; Zhang, Nu; Daffis, Stephane; Rudensky, Alexander Y.; Bevan, Michael J.; Clark, Edward A.; Kaja, Murali-Krishna; Diamond, Michael S.; Gale, Michael","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/513d5ea4db4eb8e94c14c46b018c6041d78119cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2816698.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV","CNS"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["acute WNV infection","innate immune response","enhanced inflammatory response","pathogenic WNV","absence of IPS","infected IPS","uncontrolled inflammatory response","virus replication","increased numbers of virus","key target cells of infection","adaptive immune interface","triggering of innate immunity","increased numbers of inflammatory DCs","Infection of cultured bone-marrow","dependent RLR","regulation of adaptive immunity","viral replication","West Nile virus","dendritic cells","non-specific immune cell proliferation","increased susceptibility","mice","CNS","triggering IFN defenses","complete loss of virus neutralization activity","chemokine responses","humoral responses","uncontrolled inflammation","lack of regulatory T cell expansion","early viral entry","proinflammatory cytokine","specific CD8","elevated systemic type","effective development","BM","Macs","macrophages","dissemination","periphery","balance","primary cortical neurons","quantity","central adaptor protein","quality","data","receptor","failure"],"language":"en"},

In common human diseases, unlike classical Mendelian disorders, genetic factors generally have small effect sizes, are multifactorial, and are highly pleiotropic. Likewise, mouse genetic models of disease often have pleiotropic and overlapping phenotypes. Moreover, phenotypic descriptions in the literature in both human and mouse are often poorly characterized and difficult to compare directly. METHODS: In this report, human genetic association results from the literature are summarized with regard to replication, disease phenotype, and gene specific results; and organized in the context of a systematic disease ontology. Similarly summarized mouse genetic disease models are organized within the Mammalian Phenotype ontology. Human and mouse disease and phenotype based gene sets are identified. These disease gene sets are then compared individually and in large groups through dendrogram analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. RESULTS: Human disease and mouse phenotype gene sets are shown to group into disease and phenotypically relevant groups at both a coarse and fine level based on gene sharing. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides a systematic and global perspective on the genetics of common human disease as compared to itself and in the context of mouse genetic models of disease.","publish_time":"2010-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yonqing; De, Supriyo; Garner, John R; Smith, Kirstin; Wang, S Alex; Becker, Kevin G","journal":"BMC Med Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8910b943170c80f2f3c5e5846b615d9c42622e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2822734.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2822734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse disease","disease phenotype","disease gene sets","context of mouse genetic models of disease","summarized mouse genetic disease models","genetics of common human disease","systematic disease ontology","mouse phenotype gene sets","human genetic association results","human common disorders","genetic factors","genetic contributions","common human diseases","gene specific results","gene sharing","Mammalian Phenotype ontology","dendrogram analysis","literature","hierarchical clustering analysis","large groups","relevant groups","classical Mendelian disorders","global perspective","small effect sizes","report","replication","fine level","regard","BACKGROUND","phenotypic descriptions","CONCLUSION","METHODS","phenotypes"],"language":"en"},

This condition is associated with lymphadenopathy, polyclonal gammopathy, hepato-splenomegaly and systemic symptoms. A number of small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in treating this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 46 year old Zambian woman who presented with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, confusion, lymphadenopathy, and renal failure. She rapidly developed multiple organ failure following the initiation of treatment of MCD with rituximab. Following admission to intensive care (ICU), she received prompt multi-organ support. After 21 days on the ICU she returned to the haematology medical ward, and was discharged in remission from her disease after 149 days in hospital. CONCLUSION: Rituximab, the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the ICU, in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for MCD with associated multiple organ failure. There is, to our knowledge, only one other published report of its successful use in an ICU setting, where it was combined with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and prednisolone. Reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with HIV and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care.","publish_time":"2010-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johns, Robin H; Doyle, Tomas; Lipman, Marc C; Cwynarski, Kate; Cleverley, Joanne R; Isaacson, Peter G; Shaw, Steve; Agarwal, Banwari","journal":"J Med Case Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5709e6d04771fd3207126fee6de4e7b607b6f21d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2825517.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2825517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multicentric Castleman"],"organizations":["MCD","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MCD","associated multiple organ failure","rituximab","extensive organ support","ICU setting","HIV patients","prompt multi-organ support","haematological disease","lymphadenopathy","efficacy","unwell patients","renal failure","intensive care","days","condition","Multicentric Castleman\u0027s Disease","effective treatment","initiation of treatment","CASE PRESENTATION","published report","pyrexia","confusion","conjunction","hepato-splenomegaly","lymphoproliferative disorder","Human Herpes Virus","diarrhoea","polyclonal gammopathy","anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody","successful use","year old Zambian woman","HHV","vomiting","notion","INTRODUCTION","systemic symptoms","haematology medical ward","incidence","remission","admission","number of small studies","cyclophosphamide","adriamycin","prednisolone","infection","knowledge","hospital","CONCLUSION","Reports"],"language":"en"},

Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the mouse, provides animal models for the study of central nervous system disease, including encephalitis and demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and for hepatitis. While there are many studies of the adaptive immune response to MHV, there has until recently been scant information on the type I interferon (IFN) response to MHV. The relationship between MHV and the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 response is paradoxical. While the type I IFN response is a crucial aspect of host defense against MHV in its natural host, there is little if any induction of IFN following infection of mouse fibroblast cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, MHV is relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 in mouse fibroblast cell lines and in human 293T cells. MHV can, under some circumstances, compromise the antiviral effects of IFN signaling. The nucleocapsid protein as well as the nsp1 and nsp3 proteins of MHV has been reported to have IFN antagonist activity. However, in primary cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and macrophages, IFN is induced by MHV infection and an antiviral state is established. Other primary cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and hepatocytes fail to produce IFN following infection and, in vivo, likely depend on IFN produced by pDCs and macrophages for protection from MHV. Thus MHV induction of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and the ability to induce an antiviral state in response to interferon is extremely cell type dependent. IFN induced protection from MHV pathogenesis likely requires the orchestrated activities of several cell types, however, the cell types involved in limiting MHV replication may be different in the liver and in the immune privileged CNS.","publish_time":"2009-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rose, Kristine M.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af10fafcbc7f54b2c2cf780db5ccf5a2b4a1c985.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2835314.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiple Sclerosis","MHV","IFN","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV induction of IFN","IFN response","MHV infection","IFN-\u03B1","MHV pathogenesis","MHV replication","antiviral effects of IFN","IFN induced protection","nsp3 proteins of MHV","IFN antagonist activity","primary cell types","\u03B2 response","infection of mouse fibroblast cell lines","cell type dependent","antiviral state","adaptive immune response","mouse hepatitis virus","interferon","macrophages","demyelinating diseases","chronic diseases","natural host","animal models","T cells","species of animal","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","immune privileged CNS","crucial aspect of host defense","encephalitis","study of central nervous system disease","liver","humans","nsp1","neurons","astrocytes","orchestrated activities","Multiple Sclerosis","Murine coronavirus","hepatocytes","ability","pDCs","organ systems","scant information","studies","circumstances","nucleocapsid protein","Coronaviruses","relationship"],"language":"en"},

In addition, it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH5(3)) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH5(3) was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dose-dependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH5(3) provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that sH5(3) constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1. As these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time, they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2010-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cornelissen, Lisette A.

The initial clinical presentation can mimic other pediatric inflammatory conditions, which often leads to significant delays in diagnosis and appropriate therapy. SJIA biomarker development is an unmet diagnostic/prognostic need to prevent disease complications. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We profiled the urine peptidome to analyze a set of 102 urine samples, from patients with SJIA, Kawasaki disease (KD), febrile illnesses (FI), and healthy controls. A set of 91 plasma samples, from SJIA flare and quiescent patients, were profiled using a customized antibody array against 43 proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes. RESULTS: We identified a 17-urine-peptide biomarker panel that could effectively discriminate SJIA patients at active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Targeted sequencing of these peptides revealed that they fall into several tight clusters from seven different proteins, suggesting disease-specific proteolytic activities. The antibody array plasma profiling identified an SJIA plasma flare signature consisting of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), interleukin (IL)-18, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), P-Selectin, MMP9, and L-Selectin. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The urine peptidomic and plasma protein analyses have the potential to improve SJIA care and suggest that SJIA urine peptide biomarkers may be an outcome of inflammation-driven effects on catabolic pathways operating at multiple sites.

Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSV-host cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins.

H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus.

Herein, we report a detailed analysis of plasmablast and monoclonal antibody responses induced by pandemic H1N1 infection in humans. Unlike antibodies elicited by annual influenza vaccinations, most neutralizing antibodies induced by pandemic H1N1 infection were broadly cross-reactive against epitopes in the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk and head domain of multiple influenza strains. The antibodies were from cells that had undergone extensive affinity maturation. Based on these observations, we postulate that the plasmablasts producing these broadly neutralizing antibodies were predominantly derived from activated memory B cells specific for epitopes conserved in several influenza strains. Consequently, most neutralizing antibodies were broadly reactive against divergent H1N1 and H5N1 influenza strains. This suggests that a pan-influenza vaccine may be possible, given the right immunogen.

In particular, ICs added to clinical samples are necessary to monitor the extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification steps in order to detect false-negative results resulting from PCR-inhibition or errors in the technical procedure. Here, we performed a large scale evaluation of the use of bacteriophages as ICs in routine molecular diagnosis. This allowed to propose simple standardized procedures (i) to design specific ECs for both DNA and RNA viruses and (ii) to use T4 (DNA) or MS2 (RNA) phages as ICs in routine diagnosis. Various technical formats for using phages as ICs were optimised and validated. Subsequently, T4 and MS2 ICs were evaluated in routine real-time PCR or RT-PCR virological diagnostic tests, using a series of 8,950 clinical samples (representing 36 distinct specimen types) sent to our laboratory for the detection of a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. The frequency of inefficient detection of ICs was analyzed according to the nature of the sample. Inhibitors of enzymatic reactions were detected at high frequency in specific sample types such as heparinized blood and bone marrow (\u003E70%), broncho-alveolar liquid (41%) and stools (36%). The use of T4 and MS2 phages as ICs proved to be cost-effective, flexible and adaptable to various technical procedures of real-time PCR detection in virology. It represents a valuable strategy for enhancing the quality of routine molecular diagnosis in laboratories that use in-house designed diagnostic systems, which can conveniently be associated to the use of specific synthetic ECs. The high rate of inhibitors observed in a variety of specimen types should stimulate the elaboration of improved technical protocols for the extraction and amplification of nucleic acids.","publish_time":"2011-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ninove, Laetitia; Nougairede, Antoine; Gazin, Celine; Thirion, Laurence; Delogu, Ilenia; Zandotti, Christine; Charrel, Remi N.; De Lamballerie, Xavier","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49ef14fbeee682057ed14674f623ca36c6d954cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3036576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS2 ICs","routine real-time PCR","use of T4","frequency of inefficient detection of ICs","various technical procedures of real-time PCR detection","routine diagnosis","PCR-inhibition","Real-time PCR techniques","MS2 phages","specific ECs","use of specific synthetic ECs","use of bacteriophages","Various technical formats","specific sample types","quality of routine molecular diagnosis","variety of DNA","RNA viruses","variety of specimen types","RT-PCR virological diagnostic tests","extraction","distinct specimen types","clinical samples","detection of viral genomes","high frequency","elaboration of improved technical protocols","various human specimens","high rate of inhibitors","amplification steps","amplification of nucleic acids","simple standardized procedures","Inhibitors of enzymatic reactions","in-house designed diagnostic systems","laboratories","order","validation","heparinized blood","false-negative results","reverse transcription","series","internal controls","errors","laboratory","virology","large scale evaluation","bone marrow","valuable strategy","broncho-alveolar liquid","nature","stools"],"language":"en"},

Whereas dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is generally considered as the IAV infection pathway, some observations suggest the occurrence of an as yet uncharacterized alternative entry route. By manipulating entry parameters we established experimental conditions that allow the separate analysis of dynamin-dependent and -independent entry of IAV. Whereas entry of IAV in phosphate-buffered saline could be completely inhibited by dynasore, a specific inhibitor of dynamin, a dynasore-insensitive entry pathway became functional in the presence of fetal calf serum. This finding was confirmed with the use of small interfering RNAs targeting dynamin-2. In the presence of serum, both IAV entry pathways were operational. Under these conditions entry could be fully blocked by combined treatment with dynasore and the amiloride derivative EIPA, the hallmark inhibitor of macropinocytosis, whereas either drug alone had no effect. The sensitivity of the dynamin-independent entry pathway to inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants affecting actomyosin dynamics as well as to a number of specific inhibitors of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream effectors thereof all point to the involvement of macropinocytosis in IAV entry. Consistently, IAV particles and soluble FITC-dextran were shown to co-localize in cells in the same vesicles. Thus, in addition to the classical dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, IAV enters host cells by a dynamin-independent route that has all the characteristics of macropinocytosis.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Vries, Erik; Tscherne, Donna M.; Wienholts, Marleen J.; Cobos-Jim\u00E9nez, Viviana; Scholte, Florine; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Rottier, Peter J.

While there has been much focus on T cell-mediated immune responses, limited knowledge exists on the role of mature B cells. We describe an approach, including a cell-based ELISA, to evaluate mature IgG antibody responses to melanoma from human peripheral blood B cells. We observed a significant increase in antibody responses from melanoma patients (n = 10) to primary and metastatic melanoma cells compared to healthy volunteers (n = 10) (P\u003C0.0001). Interestingly, we detected a significant reduction in antibody responses to melanoma with advancing disease stage in our patient cohort (n = 21) (P\u003C0.0001). Overall, 28% of melanoma patient-derived B cell cultures (n = 1,800) compared to 2% of cultures from healthy controls (n = 600) produced antibodies that recognized melanoma cells. Lastly, a patient-derived melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody was selected for further study. This antibody effectively killed melanoma cells in vitro via antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate the presence of a mature systemic B cell response in melanoma patients, which is reduced with disease progression, adding to previous reports of tumor-reactive antibodies in patient sera, and suggesting the merit of future work to elucidate the clinical relevance of activating humoral immune responses to cancer.","publish_time":"2011-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilbert, Amy E.; Karagiannis, Panagiotis; Dodev, Tihomir; Koers, Alexander; Lacy, Katie; Josephs, Debra H.; Takhar, Pooja; Geh, Jenny L.

Using heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of autonomic function, we present a bottom-up genotype\u2013phenotype analysis to investigate the association between \u03B2-AR gene polymorphisms and heart rate dynamics. METHODS: A total of 221 healthy Han Chinese adults (59 males and 162 females, aged 33.6\u00B110.8 years, range 19 to 63 years) were recruited and genotyped for three common \u03B2-AR polymorphisms: \u03B2(1)-AR Ser49Gly, \u03B2(2)-AR Arg16Gly and \u03B2(2)-AR Gln27Glu. Each subject underwent two hours of electrocardiogram monitoring at rest. We applied an information-based similarity (IBS) index to measure the pairwise dissimilarity of heart rate dynamics among study subjects. RESULTS: With the aid of agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, we categorized subjects into major clusters, which were found to have significantly different distributions of \u03B2(2)-AR Arg16Gly genotype. Furthermore, the non-randomness index, a nonlinear HRV measure derived from the IBS method, was significantly lower in Arg16 homozygotes than in Gly16 carriers. The non-randomness index was negatively correlated with parasympathetic-related HRV variables and positively correlated with those HRV indices reflecting a sympathovagal shift toward sympathetic activity. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a bottom-up categorization approach combining the IBS method and hierarchical cluster analysis to detect subgroups of subjects with HRV phenotypes associated with \u03B2-AR polymorphisms. Our results provide evidence that \u03B2(2)-AR polymorphisms are significantly associated with the acceleration/deceleration pattern of heart rate oscillation, reflecting the underlying mode of autonomic nervous system control.","publish_time":"2011-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Albert C.; Tsai, Shih-Jen; Hong, Chen-Jee; Wang, Cynthia; Chen, Tai-Jui; Liou, Ying-Jay; Peng, Chung-Kang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96ba8069882d695675b9e2e6d32c3640910735b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3087751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3087751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBS","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2-AR gene polymorphisms","common \u03B2-AR polymorphisms","AR Ser49Gly","AR Gln27Glu","AR Arg16Gly genotype","\u03B2-adrenergic receptors","different distributions of \u03B2","HRV phenotypes","heart rate variability","HRV indices","Genetic polymorphisms","dissimilarity of heart rate dynamics","nonlinear HRV measure","IBS method","non-randomness index","deceleration pattern of heart rate oscillation","subgroups of subjects","study subjects","phenotype analysis","parasympathetic-related HRV variables","RESULTS","years","aid of agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis","underlying mode of autonomic nervous system control","indicator of autonomic function","association","healthy Han Chinese adults","total","sympathovagal shift","functions","acceleration","Arg16 homozygotes","hours of electrocardiogram monitoring","pivotal role","information-based similarity","Gly16 carriers","sympathetic activity","categorization approach","rest","females","BACKGROUND","major clusters","METHODS","evidence","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Location The Czech Republic. Methods Plant species richness in 302 nature reserves was studied by using 14 explanatory variables reflecting the reserve area, altitude, climate, habitat diversity and prevailing vegetation type. Backward elimination of explanatory variables was used to analyse the data, taking into account their interactive nature, until the model contained only significant terms. Results A minimal adequate model with reserve area, mean altitude, prevailing vegetation type and habitat diversity (expressed as the number of major habitat types in the reserve) accounted for 53.9% of the variance in species number. After removing the area effect, habitat diversity explained 15.6% of variance, while prevailing vegetation type explained 29.6%. After removing the effect of both area and vegetation type, the resulting model explained 10.3% of the variance, indicating that species richness further increased with habitat diversity, and most obviously towards warm districts. After removing the effects of area, habitat diversity and climatic district, the model still explained 9.4% of the variance, and showed that species richness (i) significantly decreased with increasing mean altitude and annual precipitation, and with decreasing January temperature in the region of the mountain flora, and (ii) increased with altitudinal range in regions of temperate and thermophilous flora. Main conclusions We described, in quantitative terms, the effects of the main factors that might be considered to be determining plant species richness in temperate nature reserves, and evaluated their relative importance. The direct habitat effect on species richness was roughly equal to the direct area effect, but the total direct and indirect effects of area slightly exceeded that of habitat. It was shown that the overall effect of composite variables such as altitude or climatic district can be separated into particular climatic variables, which influence the richness of flora in a context\u2010specific manner. The statistical explanation of richness variation at the level of families yielded similar results to that for species, indicating that the system of nature conservation provides similar degrees of protection at different taxonomic levels.","publish_time":"2002-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Py\u0161ek, Petr; Ku\u010Dera, Tom\u00E1\u0161; Jaro\u0161\u00EDk, Vojt\u011Bch","journal":"Glob Ecol Biogeogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7e3df7fca1c0f44eed4ea356a823a4f06316848.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165707.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["habitat diversity","richness of flora","direct habitat effect","reserve area","direct area effect","Methods Plant species richness","species number","regional patterns of plant species richness","indirect effects of area","variance","temperate nature reserves","prevailing vegetation type","interactive nature","particular climatic variables","overall effect of composite variables","number of major habitat types","unbiased effects of environmental variables","statistical explanation of richness variation","climatic district","resulting model","increasing mean altitude","system of nature conservation","Backward elimination of explanatory variables","regions of temperate","minimal adequate model","similar results","thermophilous flora","mountain flora","main factors","operating factors","quantitative terms","Main conclusions","significant terms","similar degrees of protection","climate","mutual correlation","annual precipitation","level of families","different taxonomic levels","temperature","context","altitudinal range","specific manner","data","account","relative importance","Location","Czech Republic","warm districts"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We constructed recombinant retrovirus and adenovirus expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and transfected into replicon\u2010expressing cells in vitro and transgenic mice in vivo. Results: Retroviral transduction of Huh7 cells to express shRNA and subsequent transfection of an HCV replicon into the cells showed that the cells had acquired resistance to HCV replication. Infection of cells expressing the HCV replicon with an adenovirus expressing shRNA resulted in efficient vector delivery and expression of shRNA, leading to suppression of the replicon in the cells by \u223C10(\u22123). Intravenous delivery of the adenovirus expressing shRNA into transgenic mice that can be induced to express HCV structural proteins by the Cre/loxP switching system resulted in specific suppression of virus protein synthesis in the liver.

Infection\u2010induced apoptosis or necrosis is suspected but no direct evidence for this yet exists. To date, Vero E6 cells are the only cell line that could be used to replicate the virus with obvious CPE (cytopathic effect) in vitro. It is known for some viruses (including members of family Coronaviridae) that CPE can be caused either by virus\u2010induced apoptosis (active death) or cell necrosis (passive death). In this study, we examined the apoptosis in the SARS\u2010CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Indeed, the results do show that the CPE was induced by apoptosis rather than necrosis, shown by typical DNA fragmentation, through the existence of apoptotic bodies and swollen mitochondria. This observation has some implications for the SARS\u2010CoV pathogenicity: SARS\u2010CoV does induce apoptosis in cell cultures and might have the same effect in vivo, responsible for the severe damage of the respiratory system.

A single\u2010tube nested RT\u2010PCR that used primers from a conserved F gene sequence was developed using a \u201Changing droplet\u201D to physically separate outer and inner primer pairs during the first round of the PCR reaction. This was accomplished by placing the inner primers in a 5 \u03BCL droplet on the underside on the reaction tube cap and mixing after the first round of PCR. As few as 0.05 pfu of virus could be detected and gave positive results with RSV strains that represented the major groups and subgroups of RSV grown in tissue culture. The nested PCR was \u223C100\u2010fold more sensitive than standard single primer PCR reactions and equivalent to standard two\u2010tube nested PCR.

The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative temporal\u2010spatial distribution of SARS\u2010CoV in the post\u2010mortem tissue samples of seven patients. Quantitation of a house\u2010keeping gene, glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was undertaken to standardize the amount of tissue tested. SARS\u2010CoV viral load and SARS\u2010CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio for each organ type were related to four time durations: onset of illness to death, death to post\u2010mortem tissue sampling, and total durations of treatment with ribavirin and hydrocortisone. The SARS\u2010CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio remained relatively stable in most organ tissue types for all these time durations. The ratio reached the highest value of equal to or greater than one for lung and small bowel, whereas those for heart, liver, spleen, and kidney were always less than one.

In this study, the development of autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells in patients with SARS at different time periods (the first week: phase I, 1 month after the disease onset: phase II/phase III) were investigated. Antibodies in sera of patients and healthy controls against: (1) A549 human pulmonary epithelial cell\u2010line, (2) human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC), (3) primary human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEC) were detected by cell\u2010based ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence staining. The results revealed that serum levels of IgG anti\u2010A549 cells antibodies, IgG anti\u2010HUVEC antibodies, and IgM anti\u2010HPEC antibodies were significantly higher in SARS patients at phase II/phase III than those in healthy controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy\u2010nine SARS patients with hip pain underwent both conventional and diffusion\u2010weighted MRI (b\u2010value = 0\u20131000 seconds/mm(2)). The abnormal regions on the diffusion\u2010weighted images were outlined by using the conventional images as guides, and the ADCs were calculated. The ADC differences between normal and AVN femoral heads were compared. RESULTS: Of the 158 hips examined, 28 had AVN (11 with bilateral hip AVN, three with right hip AVN, and three with left hip AVN). The mean ADC was markedly greater in the AVN femoral head (1.66 \u00D7 10(\u20133) mm(2)/second \u00B1 0.20) than in the normal femoral head (0.47 \u00D7 10(\u20133) mm(2)/second \u00B1 0.082; P \u003C 0.0001).

Neurotrichus, Parascalops, and Condylura have a simple middle ear cavity with a loose ectotympanic bone, ossicles of a \u201Cmicrotype\u201D morphology, and they retain a small tensor tympani muscle. These characteristics are ancestral for talpid moles. Talpa, Scalopus, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species, on the other hand, have a looser articulation between malleus and ectotympanic bone and a reduced or absent orbicular apophysis. These species lack a tensor tympani muscle, possess complete bullae, and extensions of the middle ear cavity pneumatize the surrounding basicranial bones. The two middle ear cavities communicate in Talpa, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species. Parascaptor has a hypertrophied malleus, a feature shared with Scaptochirus but not found in any other talpid genus. Differences in middle ear morphology within members of the Talpidae are correlated with lifestyle. The species with middle ears closer to the ancestral type spend more time above ground, where they will be exposed to high\u2010frequency sound: their middle ears appear suited for transmission of high frequencies. The species with derived middle ear morphologies are more exclusively subterranean. Some of the derived features of their middle ears potentially improve low\u2010frequency hearing, while others may reduce the transmission of bone\u2010conducted noise. By contrast, the unusual middle ear apparatus of Parascaptor, which exhibits striking similarities to that of golden moles, probably augments seismic sensitivity by inertial bone conduction. J.

The TC strains were serologically related to 229E, but these isolates produced colds with a frequency and severity that contrasted with the effects of 229E itself. Tests on volunteers\u0027 preinfection sera showed that the prevalence of antibody to 229E had increased during the period 1961\u20131979 and that during 1977\u20131979 only 11% of subjects had no neutralising antibody against 229E. Susceptibility to the 229E\u2010related isolates PR and TO was associated with low preinfection serum neutralising antibody against the homologous virus, and paired sera frequently showed fourfold or greater antibody rises, most commonly against the homologous strain. Volunteers infected with TO were immune when reinoculated with the same strain approximately 1 year later, but other similar volunteers were at least partly susceptible to infection with a heterologous 229E\u2010related virus after similar time intervals. Although the strains of HCV that were grown in tissue culture were all related to the prototype 229E, they appeared not to be identical with it, and this heterogeneity is probably a significant factor in the epidemiology of HCV infections.","publish_time":"2005-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reed, Sylvia E.","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1751554d5b00a25cd041205542f4ebf5ee708e9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strains of HCV","TC strains","related virus","similar volunteers","prevalence of antibody","greater antibody","tissue culture","related isolates PR","Strains of human coronavirus","homologous virus","low preinfection serum neutralising antibody","colds","organ culture","homologous strain","volunteers\u0027 preinfection sera","epidemiology of HCV infections","paired sera","similar time intervals","significant factor","coryza","sore throat","heterogeneity","severity","frequency","Tests","year","OC","effects","subjects","prototype","Susceptibility","period"],"language":"en"},

Six hundred thirty\u2010eight stool samples were collected from children under 5 years of age seeking medical care for acute diarrhea between October 2003 and September 2005 in hospitals from the Eastern\u2010Center Tunisia. All samples were tested for rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus using commercial antigen enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Positive samples for rotavirus and astrovirus were confirmed by an \u201Cin\u2010house\u201D reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). Samples positive for adenovirus antigen were subjected to further EIA screening for species F enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41. At least one viral agent was found in 30% of the specimens. The frequency of rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus was 20%, 7%, and 6%, respectively.

Two hundred and fifty nine children \u003C5 years old admitted to Hajar Hospital, 245 children with acute diarrhoea attending primary health centres in Shahrekord, and 114 children hospitalised for elective surgery were selected from October 2001 to August 2002. Stool samples were screened for enteric viruses using EM. Rotaviruses were characterised using ELISA, reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), and electropherotyping. One hundred and eighty six viruses were identified, of which 146 (78%) were rotavirus. The second most frequent virus was coronavirus, followed by calicivirus. Rotaviruses exhibited a marked seasonal variation, being most frequently isolated from November to February (50% of rotavirus recovered) and affected mostly children \u003C2 years old. The RT\u2010PCR successfully typed 139 of the 146 (95%) rotavirus G types and 124 (85%) P types. The most frequent P type was, P[8] in 108 (74%), P[4] in 16 (11%), and was P non\u2010typeable in 22 (15%).

The molecular mechanism of SARS pathogenesis remains elusive. Inflammatory stimuli can activate I\u03BAB kinase (IKK) signalsome and subsequently the nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03BAB), which influences gene expression of cyclooxygenase\u20102 (Cox\u20102) along with other transcription factors. In this work, we found that the membrane (M) protein of SARS\u2010CoV physically interacted with IKK\u03B2 using a co\u2010immunoprecipitation assay (IPA). Expression of M suppressed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u2010\u03B1) induced NF\u2010\u03BAB activation using a luciferase reporter assay. Further investigation showed M protein suppressed Cox\u20102 expression using a luciferase reporter gene assay, RT\u2010PCR and Western blot analysis. The carboxyl terminal of M protein was sufficient for the M protein function. Together, these results indicate that SARS\u2010CoV M suppresses NF\u2010\u03BAB activity probably through a direct interaction with IKK\u03B2, resulting in lower Cox\u20102 expression. Suppression of NF\u2010\u03BAB activity and Cox\u20102 expression may contribute to SARS pathogenesis. J. Med.

Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to be an important and growing challenge. As the response rate to FDA\u2010approved treatment improved over the past decade, we are facing increasing number of difficult\u2010to\u2010treat patients such as those who have failed prior anti\u2010viral therapy. The role of amantadine in the treatment of CHC remains unclear. Studies thus far have produced conflicting results, and type II error could not be excluded. This review summarized results published in the literature from 1997 to 2003, and reviewed the existing questions and controversies regarding the use of amantadine. Current literature suggests that amantadine is ineffective as monotherapy. Amantadine increased the sustained virologic response of certain treatment na\u00EFve patients when used in combination with interferon, and may be effective as an adjunct to interferon\u2010based combination therapy in some patients who have failed or relapsed on prior therapy. Factors such as small sample size, patient characteristics, and differences in treatment protocols including amantadine preparation and duration of therapy might explain the conflicting observations of various studies. Further investigations are needed to define optimal dosing and formulation of amantadine, and its appropriate role in management of CHC infection.","publish_time":"2005-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, J.

Since vitamin K, is actively absorbed in the proximal small intestine, the incomplete response of this case to orally administered vitamin K, was predictable. The infrequent occurrence of bleeding in animals with malabsorption is, in part, attributable to the ileal and colonic absorption of bacterially derived vitamin K(2). For this reason, nonspecific use of antibiotics in these animals is contraindicated. Since long\u2010chain, polyunsaturated fats impair vitamin K absorption, dietary fat given to animals with malasorption should be restricted to medium\u2010 and short\u2010chain, saturated fats. Vitamin K should be administered subcutaneously to these animals if prolonged clotting times or active bleeding is present, and routinely prior to surgery. Oral supplementation with vitamin K(3), which is absorbed in the colon and less lipid soluble than vitamin Ki, should be given to animals with malabsorption that are maintained as outpatients.

In recent years, knowledge of the prevalence of RNAi and the mechanism of gene silencing through RNAi has started to unfold. It is now believed that RNAi serves in part as an innate response against invading viral pathogens and, indeed, counter silencing mechanisms aimed at neutralizing RNAi have been found in various viral pathogens. During the past few years, it has been demonstrated that RNAi, induced by specifically designed double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, can silence gene expression of human viral pathogens both in acute and chronic viral infections. Furthermore, it is now apparent that in in vitro and in some in vivo models, the prospects for this technology in developing therapeutic applications are robust. However, many key questions and obstacles in the translation of RNAi into a potential therapeutic platform still remain, including the specificity and longevity of the silencing effect, and, most importantly, the delivery of the dsRNA that induces the system. It is expected that for the specific examples in which the delivery issue could be circumvented or resolved, RNAi may hold promise for the development of gene\u2010specific therapeutics.

All initial validation studies with the control DNA proved to be type\u2010specific. In order to evaluate the reliability of HPV type\u2010specific LAMP detecting HPV DNA from clinical samples, tissue specimens were obtained from 27 patients with external genital polypoid lesions. The histologic diagnoses included condyloma acuminatum (n = 21), bowenoid papulosis (n = 2), seborrheic keratosis (n = 2), epidermolytic acanthoma (n = 1), and hairy nymphae (n = 1). HPV\u20106 DNA and HPV\u201011 DNA were detected in 18 and 3 of 21 condylomata acuminata, respectively, and there was no simultaneous infection. HPV\u201016 DNA was detected in one of two bowenoid papuloses. HPV DNA was not detected in the seborrheic keratoses, epidermolytic acanthoma, and hairy nymphae. These results correlated perfectly with those from real\u2010time PCR analysis. Most positive samples contained high copy numbers of HPV DNA. HPV\u201011 DNA was detected in one case that could not be detected by PCR. The average reaction time was about 59 min. There was a linear correlation between the genome quantity and reaction time to reach the threshold. The LAMP method has an additional advantage as a quantitative method, and is superior in terms of sensitivity, specificity, rapidity, and simplicity, and can potentially be a valuable tool for the detection of HPV DNA.

Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT\u2010PCR) methods. Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified. On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using type\u2010specific primers targeting genes 1ab and N. The HuH\u20107 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43\u2010 and 229E\u2010like strains. Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43\u2010like, 229E\u2010like, and NL63\u2010like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively. In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains. NL63\u2010like strains were not found to circulate in 2003\u20132004, and 229E\u2010like strains did not circulate in 2004\u20132005, while OC43\u2010like strains were detected in both seasons. The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March. Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group. In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and young children during the first year of life, while all adults were immunocompromised patients. Coinfections of hCoVs and other respiratory viruses (mostly interesting the first year of life) were observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P = 0.002). In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection. In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase. Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection. J. Med.

In this paper, the influence of harvest time and cultivar on the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill). D.A. Webb) were evaluated. Ten cultivars were considered, grown in the same orchard and subjected to the same agronomical regime. Almonds were collected at two different harvest times: (i) when the fruits were unripe, but already edible, and showed green and moist hull; and (ii) when the fruits were ripe, with dry brown hull. The analyses of proximate composition, fatty acid profile, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity were carried out. RESULTS: Lipid content increased (P \u003C 0.001) during ripening, while both protein and carbohydrate content decreased (P \u003C 0.01). Fatty acid composition showed a not univocal behavior during ripening and was highly influenced by cultivar. Total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity varied among cultivars but increased during ripening with the exception of cv Marcona. The \u2018Genco\u2019 and \u2018Francol\u00EC\u2019 cultivars were found to be phenolic rich. CONCLUSION: Harvest time and cultivar significantly influenced the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds. Genotype strongly influenced fatty acid composition and total phenolic compounds. The changes of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity suggest that the synthesis of antioxidants also occurs in the last stage of ripening. Unripe almonds, a valuable niche product, showed interesting nutritional value. \u00A9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","publish_time":"2018-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Summo, Carmine; Palasciano, Marino; De Angelis, Davide; Paradiso, Vito M; Caponio, Francesco; Pasqualone, Antonella","journal":"J Sci Food Agric","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de6f59694bffd15d691fc8f77e066e0720795831.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167047.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167047/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["D.A.

The FIVpositive cats were divided into 3 groups: group I included asymptomatic carriers; group II comprised sick FIV\u2010infected cats with illnesses not likely to influence the hemostatic system; and group III included FIV\u2010positive cats with diseases potentially associated with coagulopathies. Platelet counts in FIV/FeLV\u2010infected cats were significantly lower than in healthy cats (P \u003C .003), whereas the differences in the 3 groups of FIV\u2010positive cats were variable (group I, P= .009; II, P= .05; III, P= .09). Thrombocytopenia (\u003C 145,000 platelets/\u03BCL) was present in 4 FIV\u2010positive and 3 FIV/FeLV\u2010positive cats. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen (0.5 and 0.25 \u03BCg/mL), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (1 and 0.6 \u03BCmol/L), and thrombin (0.4 and 0.25 IU/mL) was not significantly different from that of healthy cats. The plasma coagulation system was evaluated by measuring one\u2010stage prothrombin time (OSPT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time, fibrinogen concentration, coagulation factor assays, fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDP), and plasma exchange test. The OSPT was similar in FlV\u2010seropositive cats and in the healthy control group. Cats with FIV infection, however, had markedly shorter clotting times than healthy cats when using a modified test system (P \u003C .05). In all groups of FIV\u2010infected cats and in those with FIV/FeLV infection, APTT measured with 2 different commercially available tests, and a modified plasma assay was markedly prolonged compared with healthy cats (APTT1 and 2:3 modification: P \u003C .01; APTT2: P \u003C .05 except group III). In 22 of 40 cats with FIV and in 5 of 8 cats with FIV/FeLV infection, plasma samples were beyond the reference range. The thrombin time was also significantly prolonged in cats with FIV and FIV/FeLV infection (P \u003C .01); values in 17 of 40 FIV\u2010positive cats were above reference range. The mean fibrinogen concentration of cats with FIV and FIV/FeLV infection was higher than in the healthy control group (P \u003C .001). Factor VIII activity of 4 cats with FIV infection was 1.5 times higher than that of healthy cats. Factor XII activity of 3 cats from a group of 20 cats with prolonged APTT was between 20% and 35%. Factor IX and XI activities ranged between 70% and 120%. The markedly prolonged APTT in 2 FIV\u2010positive cats could be shortened considerably in a plasma exchange test using 20% feline pooled plasma. The alterations in the coagulogram of FIV\u2010seropositive cats were not related to a clinical stage or concurrent diseases.

To address the latter, we studied the evolution in vertebrates of three genes, pomc, pmch and pmchl, that code for \u03B1\u2010MSH and two melanin\u2010concentrating hormones (MCH and MCHL). These hormones induce either dispersion/aggregation or the synthesis of pigments. We find that \u03B1\u2010MSH is highly conserved during evolution, as is its role in dispersing/synthesizing pigments. Also conserved is the three\u2010exon pmch gene that encodes MCH, which participates in feeding behaviours. In contrast, pmchl (known previously as pmch), is a teleost\u2010specific intron\u2010less gene. Our data indicate that in zebrafish, pmchl\u2010expressing neurons extend axons to the pituitary, supportive of an MCHL hormonal role, whereas zebrafish and Xenopus pmch\u002B neurons send axons dorsally in the brain.

Twelve clinical studies published from 1961\u20131997 concluded that echinacea was efficacious for treating the common cold, but the results are unclear due to inherent flaws in study design. Five trials were published since 1997; two showed that echinacea lacked efficacy for treating and preventing URTI symptoms, and three concluded that it was effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and severity of common cold symptoms. Again, these results are unclear because of methodologic uncertainties, such as small populations and use of noncommercially available, nonstandardized dosage forms.

On Western blots, the antibodies recognized the \u223C165 kDa MNK protein in CHO cells and human fibroblasts. No MNK signal could be detected in fibroblasts from a patient with Menkes disease or in Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells, confirming the specificity of the antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis of CHO cells and human fibroblasts showed a distinct perinuclear signal corresponding to the pattern of the Golgi complex. This staining pattern was similar to that of \u03B1-mannosidase II which is a known resident enzyme of the Golgi complex. Using brefeldin A, a fungal inhibitor of protein secretion, we further demonstrated that the MNK protein is localized to the trans-Golgi network. This data provides direct evidence for a subcellular localization of the MNK protein which is similar to the proposed vacuolar localization of Ccc2p, the yeast homolog of MNK and WND (ATP7B), the Wilson disease gene product. In light of the proposed role of MNK both in subcellular copper trafficking and in copper efflux, these data suggest a model for how these two processes are linked and represent an important step in the functional analysis of the MNK protein.","publish_time":"1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dierick, Herman A.; Adam, Ayla N.; Escara-Wilke, June F.; Glover, Thomas W.","journal":"Hum Mol Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abbd7c04aaaedd34c2210c11153145c9e2bf46bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185191.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wilson"],"organizations":["MNK","CHO","WND"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MNK signal","kDa MNK protein","proposed role of MNK","Menkes protein","MNK fusion construct","yeast homolog of MNK","human fibroblasts","Immunocytochemical analysis of CHO cells","cultured cells","Golgi complex","polyclonal antibodies","purified antibodies","fungal inhibitor of protein secretion","subcellular localization","Menkes disease","functional analysis","data","Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells","Western analysis of cell lysates","subcellular copper trafficking","trans-Golgi network","copper efflux","proposed vacuolar localization of Ccc2p","staining pattern","Western blots","distinct perinuclear signal corresponding","Wilson disease gene product","indirect immunofluorescence experiments","ATP7B","histidine","WND","ATP7A","metal-binding domains","known resident enzyme","immunizing rabbits","amino-terminal","direct evidence","patient","specificity","\u03B1-mannosidase","important step","model","light","processes","brefeldin"],"language":"en"},

The number of cases of diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. A comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to have similar sensitivity.

The 1a replicase from BMV is a membrane protein of unknown structure with a methyltransferase N-terminal domain and a putative helicase activity in the C-terminal domain. In order to make a functional prediction of the helicase activity of the BMV 1a C-terminal domain, we have built a model of its structure. The use of fold recognition servers hinted at two different superfamilies of helicases [superfamily 1 (SF1) and superfamily 2 (SF2)] as putative templates for the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a. A structural model of BMV 1a in SF2 was obtained by means of a fold recognition server (3D-PSSM). On the other hand, we used the helicase motifs described in the literature to construct a model of the structure of the BMV 1a C-terminal domain as a member of the SF1. The biological functionality and statistic potentials were used to discriminate between the two models. The results illustrate that the use of sequence profiles and patterns helps modeling. Accordingly, the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a is a potential member of the SF1 of helicases, and it can be modeled with the structure of a member of the UvrD family of helicases. The helicase mechanism was corroborated by the model and this supports the hypothesis that BMV 1a should have helicase activity.","publish_time":"2004-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garriga, Dami\u00E0; D\u00ECez, Juana; Oliva, Baldomero","journal":"J Mol Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e19032a46b11c9c4290687af989e0d777f4c2952.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187956.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187956/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C-terminal domain of BMV","C-terminal fragment of BMV","structural model of BMV","putative helicase activity","methyltransferase N-terminal domain","helicase motifs","SF1 of helicases","helicase mechanism","potential member","representative member of positive","superfamily","SF2","membrane protein of unknown structure","use of fold recognition servers","different superfamilies of helicases","UvrD family of helicases","putative templates","use of sequence profiles","strand RNA viruses","functional prediction","D-PSSM","Brome mosaic virus","biological functionality","statistic potentials","patterns","replicase","literature","order","results","hand","hypothesis","models"],"language":"en"},

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight (ASM/Wt) and the prevalence of sarcopenia were analyzed in groups of women stratified by duration of HT use. RESULTS: ASM/Wt was higher and the prevalence of sarcopenia was lower in participants with a history of prolonged (\u226513 mo) HT use than in participants with a shorter duration of HT use or no HT use. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, prolonged use of HT remained significantly associated with estimated mean ASM/Wt and the prevalence of sarcopenia (odds ratio: 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.88; P = 0.01). In addition, the prevalence of sarcopenia was linearly associated with history of hypertension, duration of hypertension, physical activity, and duration of HT use.

Emerging literature place the activated GR\u03B1 at the center of all phases of disease development and resolution, including activation and re-enforcement of innate immunity, downregulation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, and restoration of anatomy and function. By the time critically ill patients necessitate vital organ support for survival, they have reached near exhaustion or exhaustion of neuroendocrine homeostatic compensation, cell bio-energetic and adaptation functions, and reserves of vital micronutrients. We review how critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction/damage, and hypovitaminosis collectively interact to accelerate an anti-homeostatic active process of natural selection. Importantly, the allostatic overload imposed by these homeostatic corrections impacts negatively on both acute and long-term morbidity and mortality. Since the bioenergetic and metabolic reserves to support homeostatic corrections are time-limited, early interventions should be directed at increasing GR\u03B1 and mitochondria number and function. Present understanding of the activated GC-GR\u03B1\u0027s role in immunomodulation and disease resolution should be taken into account when re-evaluating how to administer glucocorticoid treatment and co-interventions to improve cellular responsiveness. The activated GR\u03B1 interdependence with functional mitochondria and three vitamin reserves (B1, C, and D) provides a rationale for co-interventions that include prolonged glucocorticoid treatment in association with rapid correction of hypovitaminosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto; Chrousos, George P.","journal":"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c2724021844630b9dd333226b74ef19b4f0e41b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189617.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homeostatic corrections","activated GC-GR\u03B1","activated GR\u03B1 interdependence","increasing GR\u03B1","co-interventions","exhaustion of neuroendocrine homeostatic compensation","metabolic reserves","activated glucocorticoid receptor alpha","anti-homeostatic active process of","prolonged glucocorticoid treatment","disease resolution","vitamin reserves","reserves of vital micronutrients","early interventions","time","complex pathobiology of critical illness","critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency","vital organ support","functional mitochondria","mitochondria number","metabolic cost","enormous bioenergetic","phases of disease development","rapid correction of hypovitaminosis","cell bio-energetic","downregulation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors","activation","re-enforcement of innate immunity","s role","mitochondrial dysfunction","adaptation functions","association","culmination of hundreds","ill patients","restoration of anatomy","damage","B1","survival","immunomodulation","center","millions of years","evolution","rationale","Present understanding","cellular responsiveness","long-term morbidity","mortality","conceptual framework","account","Emerging literature","allostatic overload","Appreciation"],"language":"en"},

The management of perioperative antibiotic therapy is a major issue, but little is known about worldwide practices. METHODS: We sent by email a survey dealing with 5 daily clinical vignettes concerning perioperative antibiotic therapy to 180 LTx centers around the world. The invitation and a weekly reminder were sent to lung transplant specialists for a single consensus answer per center during a 3-month period. RESULTS: We received a total of 99 responses from 24 countries, mostly from Western Europe (n = 46) and the USA (n = 34). Systematic screening for bronchial recipient colonization before LTx was mostly performed with sputum samples (72%), regardless of the underlying lung disease. In recipients without colonization, antibiotics with activity against gram-negative bacteria resistant strains (piperacillin / tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, carbapenems) were reported in 72% of the centers, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (mainly vancomycin) were reported in 38% of the centers. For these recipients, the duration of antibiotics reported was 7 days (33%) or less (26%) or stopped when cultures of donor and recipients were reported negatives (12%). In recipients with previous colonization, antibiotics were adapted to the susceptibility of the most resistant strain and given for at least 14 days (67%). CONCLUSION: Practices vary widely around the world, but resistant bacterial strains are mostly targeted even if no colonization occurs.

As we understand more about the molecular mechanism for the formation of extracellular DNA traps, the in vivo function of this phenomenon under pathological conditions remains an enigma. In this article, we critically review the literature to summarize the evidence for extracellular DNA trap formation under in vivo conditions. Extracellular DNA traps have not only been detected in infectious diseases but also in chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as in cancer. While on the one hand, extracellular DNA traps clearly exhibit an important function in host defense, it appears that they can also contribute to the maintenance of inflammation and metastasis, suggesting that they may represent an interesting drug target for such pathological conditions.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yousefi, Shida; Simon, Dagmar; Stojkov, Darko; Karsonova, Antonina; Karaulov, Alexander; Simon, Hans-Uwe","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fa2d2e7fbe7f1c35eda7fc56910a9bf589c4e9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193637/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extracellular traps","formation of extracellular DNA traps","Extracellular DNA trap formation","extracellular milieu","mitochondrial DNA","pathological conditions","important function","cellular function of neutrophils","infectious diseases","chronic inflammatory diseases","scaffold","association","evidence","eosinophils","invading microorganisms","granule proteins","interesting drug target","phenomenon","granulocytes","molecular mechanism","immobilization","basophils","host defense","literature","enigma","hand","maintenance of inflammation","metastasis","article","cancer"],"language":"en"},

Early sites of Lewy pathology are the olfactory bulb and enteric plexus of the stomach. We propose that a neurotropic pathogen, probably viral, enters the brain via two routes: (i) nasal, with anterograde progression into the temporal lobe; and (ii) gastric, secondary to swallowing of nasal secretions in saliva. These secretions might contain a neurotropic pathogen that, after penetration of the epithelial lining, could enter axons of the Meissner\u0027s plexus and, via transsynaptic transmission, reach the preganglionic parasympathetic motor neurones of the vagus nerve. This would allow retrograde transport into the medulla and, from here, into the pons and midbrain until the substantia nigra is reached and typical aspects of disease commence. Evidence for this theory from the perspective of olfactory and autonomic dysfunction is reviewed, and the possible routes of pathogenic invasion are considered. It is concluded that the most parsimonious explanation for the initial events of sporadic Parkinson\u0027s disease is pathogenic access to the brain through the stomach and nose \u2013 hence the term \u2018dual\u2010hit\u2019.","publish_time":"2007-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hawkes, C.

The time dependent Vaidya metric which represents the spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied in an energy dependent gravity\u0027s rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest we have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the nature of singularity (black hole or naked singularity) formed out of the collapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study. For our investigation we have considered two different models of [Formula: see text] gravity, namely the inflationary Starobinsky\u0027s model and the power law model. Our study reveals the fact that naked singularity is as good a possibility as black hole as far as the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning of the initial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end state of the collapse. Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in the light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The most important result derived from the study is that gravity\u0027s rainbow increases the tendency of formation of naked singularities. We have also deduced the conditions under which the singularity will be a strong or weak curvature singularity. Finally in our quest to know more about the model we have performed a thermodynamical study. Throughout the study we have obtained results which involve deviation from the classical set-up. Such deviations are expected in a quantum evolution and can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations that our model suffers from. It is expected that this study will enhance our knowledge about quantization of gravity and subsequently about the illusive theory of quantum gravity.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rudra, Prabir","journal":"Nucl Phys B","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["General Relativity"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["naked singularity","nature of singularity","central singularity","thermodynamical study","geodesic study","black hole","weak curvature singularity","naked singularities","quantum regime","illusive theory of quantum gravity","quantization of gravity","quantum evolution","quantum fluctuations","inflationary Starobinsky\u0027s model","power law model","Formula","text","quest","energy dependent gravity\u0027s rainbow","gravitational collapse","important result","non-static spacetime","time dependent Vaidya metric","light","tendency of formation","background","possibility","initial data","end state","proper fine tuning","UV completion of General Relativity","fact","different models","Cosmic Censorship hypothesis","main tool","radiating body","results","knowledge","classical set-up","investigation","deviations","collapsing procedure","focus","conditions"],"language":"en"},

There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03\u20131 \u03BCm under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subject- and manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle size- and exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p \u003C 0.001): \u223C7-fold greater for 0.04 \u03BCm, \u223C10-fold for 0.1 \u03BCm, and \u223C20-fold for 1 \u03BCm. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage.","publish_time":"2010-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grinshpun, Sergey A.; Haruta, Hiroki; Eninger, Robert M.; Reponen, Tiina; McKay, Roy T.; Lee, Shu-An","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c2c75ca28fe06220b98a20bc59c84c4bb028e78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196699.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institute","Occupational Safety"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["faceseal leakage","tested respirator","penetration pathways","tested subjects","filter medium","\u03BCm","surgical mask","N95 respirator","filter ratio","mask development","number of particles","penetration data","breathing manikins","fold","penetrating","N95 filtering facepiece respirator","prerecorded breathing patterns","size range","penetrated particles","tested submicrometer fraction","actual breathing conditions","better fit","different particle sizes","relative contributions","percentage of ambient particles","exercise-specific penetration values","Health fit testing panel","filtering facepiece particulate respirators","conventional fit test exercises","protection level","protection device","facial dimensions","health care environments","Occupational Safety","face masks","latest National Institute","pronounced effect","human subject","manikin-based tests","body movement","increase","priority","average","excess","order of magnitude","intensity","efficiency","influence","study"],"language":"en"},

Reservoir host effects on the propensity of viruses to have been reported as infecting humans were rare and when present were restricted to one or two viral families. The data instead support a largely host-neutral explanation for the distribution of human-infecting viruses across the animal orders studied. After controlling for higher baseline viral richness in mammals versus birds, the observed number of zoonoses per animal order increased as a function of their species richness. Animal orders of established importance as zoonotic reservoirs including bats and rodents were unexceptional, maintaining numbers of zoonoses that closely matched expectations for mammalian groups of their size.

ECs are battery-powered devices that vaporize a liquid that comes in small cartridges, or pods, that contain various chemicals, nicotine, and an array of flavors that can be modified to include cannabinoids (THC). With increasing popularity, however, there is an epidemic of pulmonary and gastrointestinal illnesses associated with vaping in the continental U.S.A. METHODS: We analyzed medical charts of three patients who were active users of ECs and presented with pneumonitis to our community medical center between January and August 2019. RESULTS: We report three cases of vaping pneumonitis in young adults, ages 18 to 21, who presented with similar symptoms, profiles, imaging studies, and disease progression. The average length of stay was approximately one week, and all patients had an extensive work-up in addition to a relapsing and remitting course of their condition. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of vaping pneumonitis are essential in the treatment of the ongoing epidemic. Extensive unnecessary work up may lead to increased healthcare costs. Our case series echoes the concerns of the CDC such that ECs should be avoided, and those with any pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms should seek medical attention promptly.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silverman, Andrew L.; Siddique, Haseeb; Kumar, Vikas; Le, Thuy-Hong; Ng, Joseph","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b382ff1b00757c3cb6a7408d8e993aa6d94d3e28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S.A.","CDC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of vaping pneumonitis","cases of vaping pneumonitis","patients","gastrointestinal symptoms","medical charts","active users of ECs","medical attention","extensive work","epidemic of pulmonary","community medical center","Extensive unnecessary work","gastrointestinal illnesses","similar symptoms","ongoing epidemic","imaging studies","youth","profiles","addition","Early recognition","young adults","e-cigarettes","treatment","nicotine","pods","liquid","relapsing","remitting course","popular form of smoking","concerns","Electronic cigarettes","METHODS","ages","battery-powered devices","various chemicals","disease progression","small cartridges","condition","United States","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","increased healthcare costs","week","CDC","average length of stay","array of flavors","case series","cannabinoids","increasing popularity","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy in the 1940s led to the rapid abandonment of many forms of passive antibody therapy. Chemotherapy was more effective and less toxic than antibody therapy. In this last decade of the 20th century the efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy is diminishing because of the rapidly escalating number of immunocompromised individuals, the emergence of new pathogens, the reemergence of old pathogens, and widespread development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. This diminishment in the effectiveness of chemotherapy has been paralleled by advances in monoclonal antibody technology that have made feasible the generation of human antibodies. This combination of factors makes passive antibody therapy an option worthy of serious consideration. We propose that for every pathogen there exists an antibody that will modify the infection to the benefit of the host. Such antibodies are potential antimicrobial agents. Antibody-based therapies have significant advantages and disadvantages relative to standard chemotherapy. The reintroduction of antibody-based therapy would require major changes in the practices of infectious disease specialists.","publish_time":"1995-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Casadevall, Arturo; Scharff, Matthew D.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af4043d17d0033fd6c0d4dd9107beb5a5aba4efd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reintroduction of antibody","forms of passive antibody therapy","passive antibody administration","Antibody-based therapies","based therapy","monoclonal antibody technology","efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy","introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy","serum therapy","standard chemotherapy","effectiveness of chemotherapy","antimicrobial drugs","potential antimicrobial agents","infectious diseases","emergence of new pathogens","reemergence of old pathogens","generation of human antibodies","practices of infectious disease specialists","significant advantages","disadvantages relative","widespread development of resistance","major changes","escalating number of immunocompromised individuals","option worthy of serious consideration","rapid abandonment","preantibiotic era","treatment","century","advances","combination of factors","infection","benefit","host","decade","diminishment"],"language":"en"},

A critical challenge to scientists from various disciplines worldwide is to study the specificity of cleavage activity of SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and use the knowledge obtained from the study for effective inhibitor design to fight the disease. The most commonly used inductive programming methods for knowledge discovery from data assume that the elements of input patterns are orthogonal to each other. Suppose a sub-sequence is denoted as P(2)P(1)P(1\u2032)P(2\u2032), the conventional inductive programming method may result in a rule like \u2018if P(1) = Q, then the sub-sequence is cleaved, otherwise non-cleaved\u2019. If the site P(1) is not orthogonal to the others (for instance, P(2), P(1\u2032) and P(2\u2032)), the prediction power of these kind of rules may be limited. Therefore this study is aimed at developing a novel method for constructing non-orthogonal decision trees for mining protease data. Result: Eighteen sequences of coronavirus polyprotein were downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Among these sequences, 252 cleavage sites were experimentally determined. These sequences were scanned using a sliding window with size k to generate about 50 000 k-mer sub-sequences (for short, k-mers). The value of k varies from 4 to 12 with a gap of two. The bio-basis function proposed by Thomson et al. is used to transform the k-mers to a high-dimensional numerical space on which an inductive programming method is applied for the purpose of deriving a decision tree for decision-making. The process of this transform is referred to as a bio-mapping. The constructed decision trees select about 10 out of 50 000 k-mers. This small set of selected k-mers is regarded as a set of decisive templates.

Methods and Results: MNV, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and HuNoV genogroup I and II (GI and GII) specific real\u2010time quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)\u2010PCR assays were used to determine the effects of heat exposure (63 and 72\u00B0C) for up to 10 min in water and milk. Using culture assays, MNV and HAV showed similar reductions in infectivity over time. Both HuNoV GI and GII showed lower log reductions in qRT\u2010PCR titre following heat exposure than either MNV or HAV. No significant protective effect of milk was observed for any virus. Conclusions: MNV is as suitable a surrogate for HuNoV as HAV. In heat inactivation studies at 63 and 72\u00B0C, qRT\u2010PCR results indicate that HuNoV is less susceptible to heat than either HAV or MNV and so neither virus may be an appropriate surrogate for HuNoV.

Methods and Results: This study monitored the numbers of faecal coliforms (i.e. thermotolerant coliforms), total coliforms, Escherichia coli and heterotrophic plate count bacteria on household surfaces in a rural village of Cambodia. Faecal coliform levels in Cambodia were highest on moist locations such as the plastic ladle used for sink water, the toilet seat surface and the cutting board surface with 100\u2010fold higher levels of faecal coliform bacteria than E. coli and 100\u2010fold higher levels of faecal coliforms than the US and Japanese studies. Conclusions: A single public health intervention barrier, such as an improved latrine, is only partially effective for household sanitation. For complete sanitation, multiple environmental barriers may be necessary. These barriers occur in a house constructed with easily washable surfaces, a chlorinated water distribution system, house climate control and cleaning product availability.

The challenges in rearing these organisms outside of a marine setting ultimately contributed to a shift towards work on a smaller number of so-called model systems. Those animals are typically non-marine organisms with advantages afforded by short life cycles, high fecundity, and relative ease in laboratory culture. However, a full understanding of biodiversity, evolution, and anthropogenic effects on biological systems requires a broader survey of development in the animal kingdom. To this day, marine organisms remain relatively understudied, particularly the members of the Lophotrochozoa (Spiralia), which include well over one third of the metazoan phyla (such as the annelids, mollusks, flatworms) and exhibit a tremendous diversity of body plans and developmental modes. To facilitate studies of this group, we have previously described the development and culture of one lophotrochozoan representative, the slipper snail Crepidula atrasolea, which is easy to rear in recirculating marine aquaria. Lab-based culture and rearing of larger populations of animals remain a general challenge for many marine organisms, particularly for inland laboratories. RESULTS: Here, we describe the development of an automated marine aquatic rack system for the high-density culture of marine species, which is particularly well suited for rearing filter-feeding animals. Based on existing freshwater recirculating aquatic rack systems, our system is specific to the needs of marine organisms and incorporates robust filtration measures to eliminate wastes, reducing the need for regular water changes. In addition, this system incorporates sensors and associated equipment for automated assessment and adjustment of water quality. An automated feeding system permits precise delivery of liquid food (e.g., phytoplankton) throughout the day, mimicking real-life feeding conditions that contribute to increased growth rates and fecundity. CONCLUSION: This automated system makes laboratory culture of marine animals feasible for both large and small research groups, significantly reducing the time, labor, and overall costs needed to rear these organisms.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henry, Jonathan Q.; Lesoway, Maryna P.; Perry, Kimberly J.","journal":"BMC Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17f4706e8e4314444c841a12e56f8566a1c61c26.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2f646ed450f41eea0b2a9872313f08fd4859e7ec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f1581f668432b3cf19719f0c09ef42aea36d0cd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199361.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199361/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["needs of marine organisms","non-marine organisms","marine setting","automated marine aquatic rack system","automated system","laboratory culture of marine animals feasible","recirculating marine aquaria","high-density culture of marine species","automated feeding system","Lab-based culture","biological systems","dominant systems","automated assessment","existing freshwater recirculating aquatic rack systems","larger populations of animals","day","rearing filter","broader survey of development","real-life feeding conditions","smaller number of so-called model systems","high fecundity","developmental modes","adjustment of water quality","study of developmental biology","regular water changes","lophotrochozoan representative","short life cycles","sensors","associated equipment","advantages","precise delivery of liquid food","slipper snail Crepidula atrasolea","anthropogenic effects","relative ease","tremendous diversity of body plans","general challenge","robust filtration measures","time","evolution","wastes","increased growth rates","shift","small research groups","annelids","flatworms","work","overall costs","animal kingdom","understanding of biodiversity","phytoplankton","years","inland laboratories","CONCLUSION","members","Spiralia","metazoan phyla","mollusks","addition","studies","BACKGROUND","challenges","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This period was characterized by the upgrading of infection control precautions, which included the wearing of gloves and gowns all the time, an extensive use of steroids, and a change in antibiotic prescribing practices. The pattern of endemic pathogenic organisms, the rates of acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were compared with those of the pre-SARS and post-SARS periods. Methods. Data on pathogenic isolates were obtained from the microbiology department (Prince of Wales Hospital). Data on MRSA acquisition and VAP rates were collected prospectively. MRSA screening was performed for all ICU patients. A case of MRSA carriage was defined as an instance in which MRSA was recovered from any site in a patient, and cases were classified as imported or ICU-acquired if the first MRSA isolate was recovered within 72 h of ICU admission or after 72 h in the ICU, respectively. Results. During the SARS period in the ICU, there was an increase in the rate of isolation of MRSA and Stenotrophomonas and Candida species but a disappearance of Pseudomonas and Klebsiella species. The MRSA acquisition rate was also increased: it was 3.53% (3.53 cases per 100 admissions) during the pre-SARS period, 25.30% during the SARS period, and 2.21% during the post-SARS period (P \u003C .001). The VAP rate was high, at 36.5 episodes per 1000 ventilator-days, and 47% of episodes were caused by MRSA. Conclusions. A SARS outbreak in the ICU led to changes in the pathogen pattern and the MRSA acquisition rate. The data suggest that MRSA cross-transmission may be increased if gloves and gowns are worn all the time.","publish_time":"2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yap, Florence H.

Although the phagocytic functions of isolated M\u03B8 from kittens and adults were equivalent, the mean FeLV susceptibility of M\u03B8 from kittens was five times that of M\u03B8 from adult cats, thus establishing a direct correlation between the age-related susceptibility of cats and M\u03B8 from cats to FeLV. M\u03B8 of viremic cats were found to be infected with FeLV in vivo; virus titers were slightly higher than those obtained after in vitro infection of M\u03B8. M\u03B8 from cats that had experienced regressive FeLV infection were not significantly more resistant to FeLV infection in vitro than were M\u03B8 from naive adult specific-pathogen-free cats. HC, which has been shown to enhance the in vivo FeLV susceptibility of cats, also enhanced the permissiveness of M\u03B8 from cats to FeLV in vitro (600-fold for M\u03B8 from adult cats and 200-fold for M\u03B8) from kittens. M\u03B8 permissiveness to FeLV was highly sensitive to HC and occurred in M\u03B8 infected in vivo or in vitro. In parallel with the effect of HC on the natural resistance of cats to FeLV, administration of silica before virus inoculation also markedly enhanced the FeLV susceptibility of adult cats. Silica was toxic for isolated M\u03B8 but not for lymphocytes in vitro, and silica produced monocytopenia and neutrophilia, delayed skin allograft rejection, and augmented feline oncovirus-associated cell membrane antigen antibody responses in vivo. These experiments indicate that M\u03B8 were linked to the natural resistance of cats to FeLV and that the temporary elimination of M\u03B8 functions (e.g., by silica) and/or the conversion of the M\u03B8-FeLV relationship from a nonpermissive to a permissive state (e.g., by corticosteroids) resulted in failure of early virus containment, in persistent virus amplification in hemolymphatic tissues, and in subsequent FeLV-related proliferative or antiproliferative disease.","publish_time":"1981-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoover, Edward A.; Rojko, Jennifer L.; Wilson, Pamela L.; Olsen, Richard G.","journal":"J Natl Cancer Inst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f84e8a516c36dc5580de8d93021061c799a9cd9f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["M\u03B8-FeLV relationship","M\u03B8-FeLV interactions","FeLV susceptibility of cats","M\u03B8 of viremic cats","infection of M\u03B8","permissiveness of M\u03B8","M\u03B8 permissiveness","M\u03B8 infected","mean FeLV susceptibility of M\u03B8","FeLV susceptibility of adult cats","free cats","age-related susceptibility of cats","regressive FeLV infection","age-related resistance of cats","natural resistance of cats","phagocytic functions of isolated M\u03B8","temporary elimination of M\u03B8 functions","subsequent FeLV-related proliferative","kittens","feline leukemia virus","virus inoculation","virus titers","administration of silica","effect of HC","persistent virus amplification","failure of early virus containment","naive adult specific-pathogen","fold","effect of hydrocortisone","role of autochthonous peritoneal feline macrophages","augmented feline oncovirus-associated cell membrane antigen antibody responses","delayed skin allograft rejection","monocytopenia","neutrophilia","hemolymphatic tissues","adults","nonpermissive","functional properties","direct correlation","times","antiproliferative disease","corticosteroids","study","lymphocytes","conversion","permissive state","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Inappropriate complement activation underlies the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases. Complement component 5 (C5) is a validated therapeutic target for complement-mediated diseases, but the development of new therapeutics has been limited by a paucity of preclinical models to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of candidate therapies. The present report describes a novel humanized C5 mouse and its utility in evaluating a panel of fully human anti-C5 antibodies. Surprisingly, humanized C5 mice revealed marked differences in clearance rates amongst a panel of anti-C5 antibodies. One antibody, pozelimab (REGN3918), bound C5 and C5 variants with high affinity and potently blocked complement-mediated hemolysis in vitro. In studies conducted in both humanized C5 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, pozelimab demonstrated prolonged PK and durable suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo. In humanized C5 mice, a switch in dosing from in-house eculizumab to pozelimab was associated with normalization of serum C5 concentrations, sustained suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo, and no overt toxicity.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been proposed to help guide decision-making for readiness to liberate from MV following a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and prospective observational studies that measured BNP levels at the time of SBT in patients receiving MV. The primary endpoint was successful liberation from MV (absence of reintubation or non-invasive ventilation at 48 h). Statistical analyses included bi-variate and Moses-Littenberg models and DerSimonian-Laird pooling of areas under ROC curve (AUROC). RESULTS: A total of 731 articles were screened. Eighteen adult and 2 pediatric studies were fulfilled pre-specified eligibility. The measure of the relative variation of BNP during SBT (\u0394BNP%) after exclusion of SBT failure by clinical criteria in adults yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.889 [0.831\u20130.929] and 0.828 [0.730\u20130.896] for successful liberation from MV, respectively, with a pooled AUROC of 0.92 [0.88\u20130.97]. The pooled AUROC for any method of analysis for absolute variation of BNP (\u0394BNP), pre-SBT BNP, and post-SBT BNP were 0.89 [0.83\u20130.95], 0.77 [0.63\u20130.91], and 0.85 [0.80\u20130.90], respectively. CONCLUSION: The relative change in BNP during a SBT has potential value as an incremental tool after successful SBT to predict successful liberation from MV in adults.

Aortic wall weakness and abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles predispose these patients to dilatation of the thoracic aorta, which is generally silent but can precipitate aortic dissection or rupture with devastating and often fatal consequences. Current strategies to assess the future risk of aortic dissection or rupture are based primarily on monitoring aortic diameter. However, diameter alone is a poor predictor of risk, with many patients experiencing dissection or rupture below current intervention thresholds. Developing tools that improve the risk assessment of those with aortopathy is internationally regarded as a research priority. A robust understanding of the molecular pathways that lead to aortic wall weakness is required to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could improve patient management. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the genetically determined mechanisms underlying inherited aortopathies and critically appraise the available blood biomarkers, imaging techniques, and therapeutic targets that have shown promise for improving the management of patients with these important and potentially fatal conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fletcher, Alexander J.; Syed, Maaz B.J.; Aitman, Timothy J.; Newby, David E.; Walker, Niki L.","journal":"Circulation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0b1f621c398488aa461ddeb643c08f0a9b88700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Aortic wall weakness","future risk of aortic dissection","rupture","monitoring aortic diameter","management of patients","current understanding","thoracic aorta","Inherited thoracic aortopathies","abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles","inherited aortopathies","therapeutic targets","risk assessment","Current strategies","fatal conditions","poor predictor of risk","current intervention thresholds","robust understanding","patient management","fatal consequences","available blood biomarkers","group of congenital conditions","imaging techniques","molecular pathways","dilatation","determined mechanisms","disease","promise","aortopathy","tools","research priority"],"language":"en"},

Besides the genes encoding these toxins (tcdA and tcdB), the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) also contains genes encoding a sigma factor (tcdR) and a putative anti-sigma factor (tcdC). The important role of TcdR as a sigma factor for toxin expression is undisputed, whereas the role of TcdC as an anti-sigma factor, inhibiting toxin expression, is currently the subject of debate. To clarify the role of TcdC in toxin expression, we generated an isogenic ClosTron-based mutant of tcdC in Clostridium difficile strain 630\u0394 Erm (CT::tcdC) and determined the transcription levels of the PaLoc genes and the expression levels of the toxins in the wild type strain and the tcdC mutant strain.

Priority setting favours HIV, TB and malaria interventions. Little is known about the challenges faced in this setting with regard to critical care medicine. The aim of this study was to analyse and categorise the diagnosis and outcomes of 1,774 patients admitted to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) in a low-income country over a 7-year period. We also assessed the country\u2019s ICU bed capacity and described the challenges faced in dealing with critically ill patients in this setting. FINDINGS: A retrospective audit was conducted in a general ICU in a university hospital in Uganda. Demographic data, admission diagnosis, and ICU length of stay were recorded for the 1,774 patients who presented to the ICU in the period January 2003 to December 2009. Their mean age was 35.5 years. Males accounted for 56.5% of the study population; 92.8% were indigenous, and 42.9% were referrals from upcountry units. The average mortality rate over the study period was 40.1% (n = 715). The highest mortality rate (44%) was recorded in 2004 and the lowest (33.2%) in 2005. Children accounted for 11.6% of admissions (40.1% mortality). Sepsis, ARDS, traumatic brain injuries and HIV related conditions were the most frequent admission diagnoses. A telephonic survey determined that there are 33 adult ICU beds in the whole country. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was 40.1%, with sepsis, head injury, acute lung injury and HIV/AIDS the most common admission diagnoses. The country has a very low ICU bed capacity.

CT is a heterohexameric protein complex with a 240-residue A subunit and a pentameric B subunit of identical 103-residue B polypeptides. The A subunit is proteolytically cleaved within a disulfide-linked loop to generate the A1 and A2 fragments. The B subunit of wild-type (wt) CT binds 5 cell surface ganglioside GM(1) (GM(1)) molecules, and the toxin-GM(1) complex traffics from the plasma membrane (PM) retrograde through endosomes and the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER, the enzymatic A1 fragment retrotranslocates to the cytosol to cause disease. Clustering of GM(1) by multivalent toxin binding can structurally remodel cell membranes in ways that may assist toxin uptake and retrograde trafficking. We have recently found, however, that CT may traffic from the PM to the ER by exploiting an endogenous glycosphingolipid pathway (A. A. Wolf et al., Infect. Immun. 76:1476\u20131484, 2008, and D. J. F. Chinnapen et al., Dev. Cell 23:573\u2013586, 2012), suggesting that multivalent binding to GM(1) is dispensable. Here we formally tested this idea by creating homogenous chimeric holotoxins with defined numbers of native GM(1) binding sites from zero (nonbinding) to five (wild type). We found that a single GM(1) binding site is sufficient for activity of the holotoxin.

RESULTS: Samples were obtained from 1037 subjects (91%) in the trial. The prevalence of mannose-binding lectin deficiency ranged from 0.5% to 52.2%, depending on how deficiency was defined. No differences in the prevalence of deficiency were observed with respect to any demographic variable assessed, and no differences were observed in time to first exacerbation, rate of exacerbations, or percentage of subjects requiring hospitalization for exacerbations in those with deficiency versus those without, regardless of how deficiency was defined. CONCLUSION: In a large sample of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease selected for having an increased risk of experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, only 1.9% had mannose-binding lectin concentrations below the normal range and we found no association between mannose-binding lectin concentrations and time to first acute exacerbation or frequency of acute exacerbations during one year of prospective follow-up.","publish_time":"2012-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albert, Richard K; Connett, John; Curtis, Jeffrey L; Martinez, Fernando J; Han, MeiLan K; Lazarus, Stephen C; Woodruff, Prescott G","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed2de3694f5580ea38f4adf24bd1c8b46862df1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3514010.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3514010/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mannose-binding lectin deficiency","serum mannose-binding lectin concentrations","prevalence of mannose","prevalence of deficiency","frequency of acute exacerbations","acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","rate of exacerbations","percentage of subjects","time of enrollment","differences","large sample of subjects","year of prospective follow-up","collectin","association","normal range","increased risk","respect","hospitalization","host defense","study","infection","demographic variable","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Participants","CONCLUSION","azithromycin","Samples","RESULTS","trial"],"language":"en"},

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the exchange of genetic material is not limited to the transfer from parent to offspring but can also occur through horizontal transfer (HT). Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA fragments with an innate propensity for HT; they are mobile and possess parasitic characteristics that allow them to exist and proliferate within host genomes. However, horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) is not easily detected, primarily because the complex TE life cycle can generate phylogenetic patterns similar to those expected for HTT events. The increasingly large number of new genome projects, in all branches of life, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the TE content and HTT events in these species, although a standardized method of HTT detection is required before trends in the HTT rates can be evaluated in a wide range of eukaryotic taxa and predictions about these events can be made. Thus, we propose a straightforward hypothesis test that can be used by TE specialists and nonspecialists alike to discriminate between HTT events and natural TE life cycle patterns. We also discuss several plausible explanations and predictions for the distribution and frequency of HTT and for the inherent biases of HTT detection. Finally, we discuss some of the methodological concerns for HTT detection that may result in the underestimation and overestimation of HTT rates during eukaryotic genome evolution.","publish_time":"2012-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallau, Gabriel Luz; Ortiz, Mauro Freitas; Loreto, Elgion Lucio Silva","journal":"Genome Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ae3c51a5e1057f20b5e37b7e5e21d1aa9d979d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3516303.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3516303/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TE","HTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTT events","frequency of HTT","overestimation of HTT rates","inherent biases of HTT detection","standardized method of HTT detection","complex TE life cycle","TE content","TE specialists","horizontal transfer","natural TE life cycle patterns","branches of life","predictions","species","horizontal transposon transfer","eukaryotic genome evolution","genetic similarity","phylogenetic patterns similar","exchange of genetic material","wide range of eukaryotic taxa","large number of new genome projects","DNA fragments","distribution","innate propensity","unprecedented opportunity","underestimation","nonspecialists","trends","Transposable elements","growing body of evidence","existence","plausible explanations","offspring","methodological concerns","straightforward hypothesis test","common ancestor","parasitic characteristics","parent","host genomes"],"language":"en"},

The recovered recombinant APMV-4 resembled the biological virus in growth characteristics in vitro and in pathogenicity in vivo. The F cleavage site sequence of APMV-4 (DIQPR\u2193F) contains a single basic amino acid, at the -1 position. Six mutant APMV-4 viruses were recovered in which the F protein cleavage site was mutated to contain increased numbers of basic amino acids or to mimic the naturally occurring cleavage sites of several paramyxoviruses, including neurovirulent and avirulent strains of NDV. The presence of a glutamine residue at the -3 position was found to be important for mutant virus recovery. In addition, cleavage sites containing the furin protease motif conferred increased replication and syncytium formation in vitro. However, analysis of viral pathogenicity in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs, 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens, and 3-week-old ducks showed that none the F protein cleavage site mutations altered the replication, tropism, and pathogenicity of APMV-4, and no significant differences were observed among the parental and mutant APMV-4 viruses in vivo. Although parental and mutant viruses replicated somewhat better in ducks than in chickens, they all were highly restricted and avirulent in both species. These results suggested that the cleavage site sequence of the F protein is not a limiting determinant of APMV-4 pathogenicity in chickens and ducks.","publish_time":"2013-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Shin-Hee; Xiao, Sa; Shive, Heather; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59a11e8976b666ba112da942d7ba7c698d06a9e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3544850.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3544850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenicity of APMV","mutant APMV","F cleavage site sequence of APMV","F protein cleavage site mutations","cleavage sites","recovered recombinant APMV","mutant viruses","recovery of infectious recombinant APMV","limiting determinant of APMV","pathogenicity of avian paramyxoviruses","mutant virus recovery","increased replication","week-old chickens","week-old ducks","analysis of viral pathogenicity","position","increased numbers of basic amino acids","single basic amino acid","biological virus","avirulent strains of NDV","day-old embryonated chicken eggs","furin protease motif","reverse genetics system","neurovirulent","tropism","syncytium formation","growth characteristics","APMVs","DIQPR","role","cloned cDNA","glutamine residue","addition","results","significant differences","presence","species"],"language":"en"},

A novel peptide from the a2 isoform of V-ATPase called a2NTD has been shown to exert an immunoregulatory role in the tumor microenvironment by controlling the maturation of monocytes toward a tumor-associated macrophage phenotype. Our data indicate that a2NTD binds to the surface of monocytes. a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by pro-inflammatory monocytes bearing a CD14(\u002B\u002B)CD16(\u002B) phenotype, which is associated with the monocyte-to-macrophage maturation process.

However, the inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis did not reduce cytokine production by monocytes. This points to the existence of two receptors that respond to a2NTD: scavengers receptors that mediate cellular uptake and an hitherto unidentified receptor stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines.

However, its related problems such as impaction and desiccation stress as well as particle bounce have not been solved. Here, we improved its biological collection efficiencies by plating a mineral oil layer (100 \u00B5L) onto the agar plate. An Andersen six-stage sampler and a BioStage impactor were tested with mineral-oil-spread agar plates in collecting indoor and outdoor bacterial and fungal aerosols. The effects of sampling times (5, 10 and 20 min) were also studied using the BioStage impactor when sampling environmental bioaerosols as well as aerosolized Bacillus subtilis (G\u002B) and Escherichia coli (G-). In addition, particle bounce reduction by mineral-oil-plate was also investigated using an optical particle counter (OPC). Experimental results revealed that use of mineral-oil-spread agar plate can substantially enhance culturable bioaerosol recoveries by Andersen type impactors (p-values\u003C0.05). The recovery enhancement was shown to depend on bioaerosol size, type, sampling time and environment. In general, more enhancements (extra 20%) were observed for last stage of the Andersen six-stage samplers compared to the BioStage impactor for 10 min sampling. When sampling aerosolized B. subtilis, E. coli and environmental aerosols, the enhancement was shown to increase with increasing sampling time, ranging from 50% increase at 5 min to \u223C100% at 20 min. OPC results indicated that use of mineral oil can effectively reduce the particle bounce with an average of 66% for 10 min sampling. Our work suggests that enhancements for fungal aerosols were primarily attributed to the reduced impaction stress, while for bacterial aerosols reduced impaction, desiccation and particle bounce played major roles. The developed technology can readily enhance the agar-based techniques including those high volume portable samplers for bioaerosol monitoring.","publish_time":"2013-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zhenqiang; Wei, Kai; Wu, Yan; Shen, Fangxia; Chen, Qi; Li, Mingzhen; Yao, Maosheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc352893117f666477e7cf7c8c614bdf60592178.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3584084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzczNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Andersen","E. coli"],"organizations":["OPC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["mineral-oil","sampling aerosolized","bioaerosol sampling standard","use of mineral oil","mineral oil layer","increasing sampling time","BioStage impactor","particle bounce reduction","effects of sampling times","bacterial aerosols","environmental aerosols","fungal aerosols","Andersen type impactors","bioaerosol monitoring","bioaerosol size","agar plates","stage samplers","optical particle counter","reduced impaction stress","culturable bioaerosol recoveries","desiccation stress","agar-based techniques","OPC results","enhancements","increase","aerosolized Bacillus subtilis","environmental bioaerosols","Escherichia coli","Experimental results","recovery enhancement","high volume portable samplers","\u00B5L","p-values","anthrax attacks","biological collection efficiencies","major roles","addition","related problems","investigation","United States","work","developed technology","invention","average"],"language":"en"},

It is activated by long stretches of dsRNA and provides the first line of host defense against pathogens by inhibiting translation initiation in the infected cell. Many cellular and viral transcripts contain nucleoside modifications and/or tertiary structure that could affect PKR activation. We have previously demonstrated that a 5\u2032-end triphosphate\u2013a signature of certain viral and bacterial transcripts\u2013confers the ability of relatively unstructured model RNA transcripts to activate PKR to inhibit translation, and that this activation is abrogated by certain modifications present in cellular RNAs. In order to understand the biological implications of native RNA tertiary structure and nucleoside modifications on PKR activation, we study here the heavily modified cellular tRNAs and the unmodified or the lightly modified mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNA). We find that both a T7 transcript of yeast tRNA(Phe) and natively extracted total bovine liver mt-tRNA activate PKR in vitro, whereas native E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, and wheat tRNA(Phe) do not, nor do a variety of base- or sugar-modified T7 transcripts. These results are further supported by activation of PKR by a natively folded T7 transcript of tRNA(Phe) in vivo supporting the importance of tRNA modification in suppressing PKR activation in cells. We also examine PKR activation by a T7 transcript of the A14G pathogenic mutant of mt-tRNA(Leu), which is known to dimerize, and find that the misfolded dimeric form activates PKR in vitro while the monomeric form does not. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo findings herein indicate that tRNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR and that nucleoside modifications and native RNA tertiary folding may function, at least in part, to suppress such activation, thus serving to distinguish self and non-self tRNA in innate immunity.","publish_time":"2013-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nallagatla, Subba Rao; Jones, Christie N.; Ghosh, Saikat Kumar B.; Sharma, Suresh D.; Cameron, Craig E.; Spremulli, Linda L.; Bevilacqua, Philip C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20656a048091de934d0fb432f8d070304a1664dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3587421.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3587421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PKR activation","activation of PKR","wheat tRNA","T7 transcript of yeast tRNA","folded T7 transcript of tRNA","non-self tRNA","nucleoside modifications","importance of tRNA modification","total bovine liver mt-tRNA","Phe","viral transcripts","sugar-modified T7 transcripts","modified cellular tRNAs","Interferon inducible protein kinase PKR","native RNA tertiary folding","bacterial transcripts","certain modifications present","unstructured model RNA transcripts","biological implications of native RNA tertiary structure","cellular RNAs","mitochondrial tRNAs","signature of certain viral","A14G pathogenic mutant of mt","essential component of innate immunity","translation initiation","intrinsic ability","monomeric form","misfolded dimeric form","pathogens","coli","line of host defense","end triphosphate","infected cell","variety of base","Leu","cells","order","dsRNA","findings","results"],"language":"en"},

However, the disproportionate epidemiologic clustering of severe malaria with aggressive forms of endemic diseases such as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS), a neoplasm that is etiologically linked to infection with KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), underscores the significance of previously unexplored co-pathogenetic interactions that have the potential to modify the overall disease burden in co-infected individuals. Based on recent studies of the mechanisms that P. falciparum and KSHV have evolved to interact with their mutual human host, several new perspectives are emerging that highlight a surprising convergence of biological themes potentially underlying their associated co-morbidities. Against this background, ongoing studies are rapidly constructing a fascinating new paradigm in which the major host receptors that control parasite invasion (Basigin/CD147) and cyto-adherence (CD36) are, surprisingly, also important targets for exploitation by KSHV. In this article, we consider the major pathobiological implications of the co-option of Basigin/CD147 and CD36 signaling pathways by both P. falciparum and KSHV, not only as essential host factors for parasite persistence but also as important mediators of the pro-angiogenic phenotype within the virus-infected endothelial microenvironment. Consequently, the triangulation of interactions between P. falciparum, KSHV, and their mutual human host articulates a syndemic relationship that points to a conceptual framework for prevalence of aggressive forms of KS in malaria-endemic areas, with implications for the possibility of dual-use therapies against these debilitating infections in resource-limited parts of the world.","publish_time":"2013-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conant, Katelyn L.; Kaleeba, Johnan A.

Many viral proteomes encode disordered proteins and modulate host factors through the use of short linear motifs (SLiMs) embedded within disordered regions. However, the degree of viral protein disorder across different viruses is not well understood, so we set out to establish the constraints acting on viruses, in terms of their use of disordered protein regions. We surveyed predicted disorder across 2,278 available viral genomes in 41 families, and correlated the extent of disorder with genome size and other factors. Protein disorder varies strikingly between viral families (from 2.9% to 23.1% of residues), and also within families. However, this substantial variation did not follow the established trend among their hosts, with increasing disorder seen across eubacterial, archaebacterial, protists, and multicellular eukaryotes. For example, among large mammalian viruses, poxviruses and herpesviruses showed markedly differing disorder (5.6% and 17.9%, respectively). Viral families with smaller genome sizes have more disorder within each of five main viral types (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA\u002B, dsRNA, retroviruses), except for negative single-stranded RNA viruses, where disorder increased with genome size. However, surveying over all viruses, which compares tiny and enormous viruses over a much bigger range of genome sizes, there is no strong association of genome size with protein disorder. We conclude that there is extensive variation in the disorder content of viral proteomes. While a proportion of this may relate to base composition, to extent of gene overlap, and to genome size within viral types, there remain important additional family and virus-specific effects. Differing disorder strategies are likely to impact on how different viruses modulate host factors, and on how rapidly viruses can evolve novel instances of SLiMs subverting host functions, such as innate and acquired immunity.","publish_time":"2013-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pushker, Ravindra; Mooney, Catherine; Davey, Norman E.; Jacqu\u00E9, Jean-Marc; Shields, Denis C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40c76ef7831f3e2df1619e05514849a67a07d5d6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/707a1297b8ac950819a217102e5f4847a67b48c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3631256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3631256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extent of disorder","increasing disorder","degree of viral protein disorder","predicted disorder","viral families","disorder content of viral proteomes","different viruses","Differing disorder strategies","enormous viruses","main viral types","disordered regions","available viral genomes","large mammalian viruses","use of disordered protein regions","smaller genome sizes","host factors","strong association of genome size","disordered proteins","bigger range of genome sizes","negative single-stranded RNA viruses","eukaryotic proteomes","subverting host functions","extensive variation","substantial variation","extent of gene overlap","use of short linear motifs","key","important additional family","regulatory modules","dsDNA","poxviruses","herpesviruses","ssRNA","ssDNA","novel instances","virus-specific effects","terms","mediate interactions","protists","retroviruses","dsRNA","established trend","base composition","hosts","multicellular eukaryotes","example","constraints","proportion","immunity","residues","surveying"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae RTIs currently relies on serological methods and/or the detection of bacterial DNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT). It is conceivable, however, that these diagnostic methods also yield positive results if M. pneumoniae is carried asymptomatically in the URT. Positive results from these tests may therefore not always be indicative of a symptomatic infection. The existence of asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae has not been established. We hypothesized that asymptomatic carriage in children exists and investigated whether colonization and symptomatic infection could be differentiated by current diagnostic methods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted at the Erasmus MC\u2013Sophia Children\u0027s Hospital and the after-hours General Practitioners Cooperative in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Asymptomatic children (n = 405) and children with RTI symptoms (n = 321) aged 3 mo to 16 y were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from July 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011. Clinical data, pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens, and serum samples were collected. The primary objective was to differentiate between colonization and symptomatic infection with M. pneumoniae by current diagnostic methods, especially real-time PCR. M. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 21.2% (95% CI 17.2%\u201325.2%) of the asymptomatic children and in 16.2% (95% CI 12.2%\u201320.2%) of the symptomatic children (p = 0.11). Neither serology nor quantitative PCR nor culture differentiated asymptomatic carriage from infection. A total of 202 children were tested for the presence of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. Finally, longitudinal sampling showed persistence of M. pneumoniae in the URT for up to 4 mo. Fifteen of the 21 asymptomatic children with M. pneumoniae and 19 of the 22 symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae in this longitudinal follow-up tested negative after 1 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study has limitations, such as a single study site and limited sample size, our data indicate that the presence of M. pneumoniae in the URT is common in asymptomatic children. The current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic infection.

There is an ongoing outbreak of cryptococcosis in the western United States and Canada. Cryptococcosis is a disease resulting from the inhalation of the infectious propagules from the environment. The current and most frequently used animal infection models initiate infection via liquid suspension through intranasal instillation or intravenous injection. These models do not replicate the typically dry nature of aerosol exposure and may hinder our ability to decipher the initial events that lead to clearance or the establishment of infection. We have established a standardized aerosol model of murine infection for the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus. Aerosolized cells were generated utilizing a Collison nebulizer in a whole-body Madison Chamber at different humidity conditions. The aerosols inside the chamber were sampled using a BioSampler to determine viable aerosol concentration and spray factor (ratio of viable aerosol concentration to total inoculum concentration). We have effectively delivered yeast and yeast-spore mixtures to the lungs of mice and observed the establishment of disease. We observed that growth conditions prior to exposure and humidity within the Madison Chamber during exposure can alter Cryptococcus survival and dose retained in mice.","publish_time":"2013-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Springer, Deborah J.; Saini, Divey; Byrnes, Edmond J.; Heitman, Joseph; Frothingham, Richard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b59b58c13370a390a58c6cd79e61f97bf9bee37d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3720958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Collison"],"organizations":["Aerosolized","Madison Chamber"],"locations":["United States","Canada"],"keyphrases":["establishment of infection","ratio of viable aerosol concentration","dry nature of aerosol exposure","standardized aerosol model of murine infection","whole-body Madison Chamber","used animal infection models","Cryptococcus survival","establishment of disease","total inoculum concentration","different humidity conditions","human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus","lungs of mice","growth conditions","yeast-spore mixtures","ongoing outbreak of cryptococcosis","liquid suspension","spray factor","intranasal instillation","Collison nebulizer","western United States","emerging global health threat","intravenous injection","clearance","ability","dose","BioSampler","infectious propagules","initial events","Canada","inhalation","Aerosolized cells","AIDS patient deaths","environment","infections","aerosols"],"language":"en"},

However, current parenteral immunization modalities generally fail to induce mucosal immunity, while mucosal vaccine delivery often results in poor systemic immunity. In order to find an immunization strategy which satisfies the need for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity, we compared local and systemic immune responses elicited by two mucosal immunizations, given either by the intranasal (IN) or the intrapulmonary (IPL) route, with responses elicited by a mucosal prime followed by a systemic boost immunization. The study was conducted in BALB/c mice and the vaccine formulation was an influenza subunit vaccine supplemented with GPI-0100, a saponin-derived adjuvant. While optimal mucosal antibody titers were obtained after two intrapulmonary vaccinations, optimal systemic antibody responses were achieved by intranasal prime followed by intramuscular boost. The latter strategy also resulted in the best T cell response, yet, it was ineffective in inducing nose or lung IgA. Successful induction of secretory IgA, IgG and T cell responses was only achieved with prime-boost strategies involving intrapulmonary immunization and was optimal when both immunizations were given via the intrapulmonary route. Our results underline that immunization via the lungs is particularly effective for priming as well as boosting of local and systemic immune responses.","publish_time":"2013-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Heng; Patil, Harshad P.; de Vries-Idema, Jacqueline; Wilschut, Jan; Huckriede, Anke","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/943491914a5f52c713070accbde7e0e868771e91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3729563.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3729563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systemic immune responses","mucosal prime","mucosal immunity","systemic boost immunization","mucosal immune response","mucosal immunizations","intrapulmonary immunization","optimal systemic antibody responses","mucosal vaccine delivery","poor systemic immunity","immunization strategy","optimal mucosal antibody titers","T cell responses","intrapulmonary route","intranasal prime","intrapulmonary vaccinations","prime-boost strategies","vaccine formulation","best T cell response","current parenteral immunization modalities","intramuscular boost","results","influenza subunit vaccine","respiratory tract","lung IgA","Successful induction of secretory IgA","respiratory infections","IgG","addition","c mice","inducing nose","BALB","GPI","need","Vaccines","protection","lungs","IPL","saponin-derived adjuvant","study","order"],"language":"en"},

Erythroderma, airway bleeding, and leukopenia have been shown to be predictive of mortality. The objectives of this study were to define the characteristics of patients with severe leukopenia at 48-h hospitalization and to update our data regarding mortality predicting factors in a larger population than we had previously described. METHODS: It was designed as a case-case study nested in a cohort study. A total of 148 cases of community-acquired, necrotizing pneumonia were included. The following data were collected: basic demographic information, medical history, signs and symptoms, radiological findings and laboratory results during the first 48 h of hospitalization. The study population was divided into 2 groups: (1) with severe leukopenia (leukocyte count \u22643,000 leukocytes/mL, n=62) and (2) without severe leukopenia (\u003E3,000 leukocytes/mL, n=86). RESULTS: Median age was 22 years, and the male-to-female gender ratio was 1.5. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 41.2%. Death occurred in 75.8% of severe leukopenia cases with median survival time of 4 days, and in 16.3% of cases with leukocyte count \u003E3,000/mL (P\u003C0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that the factors associated with severe leukopenia were influenza-like illness (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.45, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) 1.67-11.88, P=0.003), airway bleeding (aOR 4.53, 95% CI 1.85-11.13, P=0.001) and age over 30 years (aOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.08-6.68, P=0.033). A personal history of furuncles appeared to be protective (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.96, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: S. aureus-necrotizing pneumonia is still an extremely severe disease in patients with severe leukopenia.

One major contributor to the decline are pathogens, including several honey bee viruses. However, information is limited on the biology of bee viruses and molecular interactions with their hosts. An experimental protocol to test these systems was developed, using injections of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) into honey bee pupae reared ex-situ under laboratory conditions. The infected pupae developed pronounced but variable patterns of disease. Symptoms varied from complete cessation of development with no visual evidence of disease to rapid darkening of a part or the entire body. Considerable differences in IAPV titer dynamics were observed, suggesting significant variation in resistance to IAPV among and possibly within honey bee colonies. Thus, selective breeding for virus resistance should be possible. Gene expression analyses of three separate experiments suggest IAPV disruption of transcriptional homeostasis of several fundamental cellular functions, including an up-regulation of the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. These results provide first insights into the mechanisms of IAPV pathogenicity. They mirror a transcriptional survey of honey bees afflicted with Colony Collapse Disorder and thus support the hypothesis that viruses play a critical role in declining honey bee health.","publish_time":"2013-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boncristiani, Humberto F.; Evans, Jay D.; Chen, Yanping; Pettis, Jeff; Murphy, Charles; Lopez, Dawn L.; Simone-Finstrom, Michael; Strand, Micheline; Tarpy, David R.; Rueppell, Olav","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1842bb195a368132b3f4b433e1b1a71590fdc31e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3764161.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3764161/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["honey bee viruses","honey bee pupae","honey bee colonies","declining honey bee health","ongoing decline of honey bee health","biology of bee viruses","transcriptional survey of honey bees","IAPV titer dynamics","mechanisms of IAPV pathogenicity","IAPV disruption of transcriptional homeostasis","virus resistance","infected pupae","visual evidence of disease","variable patterns of disease","injections of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus","separate experiments","critical role","ex-situ","pathogens","complete cessation of development","hypothesis","Colony Collapse Disorder","molecular interactions","fundamental cellular functions","rapid darkening","laboratory conditions","significant variation","Gene expression analyses","regulation","insights","Considerable differences","selective breeding","systems","ribosomal biogenesis pathway","Symptoms","ecological concern","major contributor","hosts","experimental protocol","results","entire body","information"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven days post-permanent ligation, hearts from CD13 knockout (CD13(KO)) mice showed significant reductions in cardiac function, suggesting impaired healing in the absence of CD13. Mechanistically, CD13(KO) infarcts showed an increase in small, endothelial-lined luminal structures, but no increase in perfusion, arguing against an angiogenic defect in the absence of CD13. Cardiac myocytes of CD13(KO) mice showed normal basal contractile function, eliminating myocyte dysfunction as a mechanism of adverse remodelling. Conversely, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis of CD13(KO) infarcts demonstrated a dramatic 65% reduction in infiltrating haematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic, and T cells, suggesting a critical role for CD13 adhesion in inflammatory trafficking. Accordingly, CD13(KO) infarcts also contained fewer myofibroblasts, consistent with attenuation of fibroblast differentiation resulting from the reduced inflammation, leading to adverse remodelling. CONCLUSION: In the ischaemic heart, while compensatory mechanisms apparently relieve potential angiogenic defects, CD13 is essential for proper trafficking of the inflammatory cells necessary to prime and sustain the reparative response, thus promoting optimal post-infarction healing.","publish_time":"2013-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira, Flavia E.; Cronin, Chunxia; Ghosh, Mallika; Zhou, Si-Yuan; Agosto, Mariela; Subramani, Jaganathan; Wang, Ruibo; Shen, Jian-Bing; Schacke, Wolfgang; Liang, Brannen; Yang, Tie Hong; McAulliffe, Beata; Liang, Bruce T.; Shapiro, Linda H.","journal":"Cardiovascular Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7822013922e0bfb03c045d7f54b83df4c450fbbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3778957.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-pdf/100/1/74/17394273/cvt155.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD13 adhesion","role of CD13","absence of CD13","CD13 knockout","Cardiac myocytes of CD13","flow cytometric analysis of CD13","trafficking of inflammatory cells","inflammatory trafficking","infarcts","inflammatory cells necessary","cardiac function","T cells","mice","proper trafficking","infiltrating haematopoietic cells","optimal post-infarction healing","impaired healing","wound healing","increase","mechanism of adverse remodelling","normal basal contractile function","days post-permanent ligation","myocardial infarction","adhesion molecule","critical role","potential angiogenic defects","permanent coronary artery occlusion","myocyte dysfunction","hearts","compensatory mechanisms","macrophages","attenuation of fibroblast differentiation","fewer myofibroblasts","significant reductions","monocytes","reduced inflammation","RESULTS","site of injury","luminal structures","ischaemic heart","reparative response","perfusion","immunohistochemical","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

One such factor is APOBEC3G. To overcome APOBEC3G-mediated restriction, many lentiviruses encode Vif, a protein that targets APOBEC3G for degradation. As with many restriction factor genes, primate APOBEC3G displays strong signatures of positive selection. This is interpreted as evidence that the primate APOBEC3G locus reflects a long-term evolutionary \u201Carms-race\u201D between retroviruses and their primate hosts. Here, we provide direct evidence that APOBEC3G has functioned as a barrier to cross-species transmission, selecting for viral resistance during emergence of the AIDS-causing pathogen SIVmac in captive colonies of Asian macaques in the 1970s. Specifically, we found that rhesus macaques have multiple, functionally distinct APOBEC3G alleles, and that emergence of SIVmac and simian AIDS required adaptation of the virus to evade APOBEC3G-mediated restriction. Our evidence includes the first comparative analysis of APOBEC3G polymorphism and function in both a reservoir and recipient host species (sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques, respectively), and identification of adaptations unique to Vif proteins of the SIVmac lineage that specifically antagonize rhesus APOBEC3G alleles. By demonstrating that interspecies variation in a known restriction factor selected for viral counter-adaptations in the context of a documented case of cross-species transmission, our results lend strong support to the evolutionary \u201Carms-race\u201D hypothesis. Importantly, our study confirms that APOBEC3G divergence can be a critical determinant of interspecies transmission and emergence of primate lentiviruses, including viruses with the potential to infect and spread in human populations.","publish_time":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krupp, Annabel; McCarthy, Kevin R.; Ooms, Marcel; Letko, Michael; Morgan, Jennifer S.; Simon, Viviana; Johnson, Welkin E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6e2b72e575a28344c4df48d9a4aa8ae4837bbd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3789815.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3789815/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["APOBEC3G divergence","APOBEC3G-mediated restriction","primate APOBEC3G locus","rhesus APOBEC3G alleles","distinct APOBEC3G alleles","cross-species transmission","emergence of SIVmac","comparative analysis of APOBEC3G polymorphism","emergence of primate lentiviruses","known restriction factor","restriction factor genes","rhesus macaques","emergence of viral pathogens","primate hosts","Cellular restriction factors","recipient host species","critical determinant of interspecies transmission","pathogen SIVmac","SIVmac lineage","viral resistance","viral counter-adaptations","arms-race","direct evidence","documented case of cross","strong support","Vif proteins","simian AIDS","captive colonies of Asian macaques","interspecies variation","identification of adaptations unique","strong signatures of positive selection","sooty mangabeys","reservoir","function","context","results","genetic barriers","cells","retroviruses","potential","hypothesis","study","degradation","human populations"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, transgenic technology has become more versatile and sophisticated, mainly because of the incorporation of recombinase-mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion, site-specific endonuclease-mediated genome editing, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, various inducible gene expression systems, and fluorescent protein marking and tracking techniques. Site-specific recombinases (such as PhiC31) and engineered endonucleases (such as ZFN and Talen) have significantly enhanced our ability to target transgenes into specific genomic loci, but currently a great majority of transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional random insertion method. A major challenge for using this conventional method is that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial influence on the expression of the transgene. Although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive, adhering to some general guidelines can significantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression. This chapter first discusses the major problems associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles for using plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) for generating transgenic constructs. Finally, the strategies for conducting each of the major types of transgenic research are discussed, including gene overexpression, promoter characterization, cell-lineage tracing, mutant complementation, expression of double or multiple transgenes, siRNA knockdown, and conditional and inducible systems.","publish_time":"2013-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Chengyu","journal":"Lipoproteins and Cardiovascular Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5838b6b435db4fdcbc39371939b8a691cf6868d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3815551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815551/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conditional expression","expression of double","transgenic technology","transgenic constructs","various inducible gene expression systems","odds of successful transgene expression","major types of transgenic research","characterization of transgenic mice","siRNA-mediated gene knockdown","siRNA knockdown","gene overexpression","inducible systems","conventional method","major problems","major challenge","great majority of transgenic mouse lines","conventional random insertion method","site-specific endonuclease-mediated genome editing","promoter characterization","targeted insertion","multiple transgenes","genomic environment","Site-specific recombinases","specific genomic loci","important elements of biomedical research","cell-lineage tracing","mutant complementation","fluorescent protein","BACs","plasmid","bacterial artificial chromosomes","integration site","substantial influence","means","chromosomal position effects","PhiC31","ability","incorporation of recombinase","engineered endonucleases","ZFN","Talen","understanding","general guidelines","principles","tracking techniques","recent years","Generation","chapter","strategies"],"language":"en"},

Shaanxi province, which is located in northwest of China, is one of the areas in China most severely afflicted with HFRS epidemics annually. This study aims to establish a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay to detect HTNV both in cell culture and clinical serum samples. We established a SYBR Green \u2160-based one-step qRT-PCR assay that targets the S segment of the HTNV genome for rapid detection and quantification. The HTNV cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription, and the copy numbers of the HTNV cRNA were quantified. Standard curve was generated by determining the mean cycle threshold (Ct) values versus 10-fold serial dilutions of the HTNV cRNA over a range of 1\u00D710(8) to 1\u00D710(3) copies/\u03BCl. The standard curve had a reaction efficiency of 102.1%, a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.998, and a slope of -3.273. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the intra- and inter-assays ranged from 0.68% to 3.00% and from 0.86% to 3.21%, respectively. The cycle intervals of the qRT-PCR assay between each dilution ranged from 2.9 to 3.8 cycles, and the lowest detection limit of the qRT-PCR assay was 10 copies/\u03BCl. The assay exhibited high specificity that was confirmed by melting curve analysis, and no cross reaction with the Seoul virus (SEOV) and other viruses (HBV, HCV and HIV) was observed. HTNV RNA was also detected in the 27 serum samples of clinical HFRS patients using the assay, and the HTNV RNA viral load ranged from 2.06\u00D710(1) to 1.95\u00D710(5) copies/\u03BCl.

Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21- to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3\u2032-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.","publish_time":"2013-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Girardi, Erika; Chane-Woon-Ming, B\u00E9atrice; Messmer, M\u00E9lanie; Kaukinen, Pasi; Pfeffer, S\u00E9bastien","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1685a03eac1fe5f949aa6b7889e02dadf9d3f90f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3870239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","SINV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["derived viral small RNAs","viral infection","recognition of viral RNAs","stable modified small viral RNAs","RNA virus infection","small RNA-mediated silencing","presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin","small RNA population of infected cells","novel small noncoding RNA population","viral genome","RNA interference","SINV infection","host-virus interaction","RNA-induced silencing complex","antiviral role of RNAi","host-pathogen interaction","end nucleotide of SINV","Sindbis virus","host pattern recognition receptors","mammalian cells","novel way","critical role","cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase","earliest forms of antiviral immunity","organisms","existence","African green monkey cell lines","viruses","PRRs","prototypic arbovirus model","activation","RISC","findings","main defense system","SvsRNAs","species","evidence","response","Northern blot analysis","interferon pathway","present work","modification","higher vertebrates","stability"],"language":"en"},

To reveal further the characteristics of the virus and to provide insight about the molecular mechanism of SARS etiology, a proteomic strategy was utilized to identify the structural proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) isolated from Vero E6 cells infected with the BJ\u201001 strain of the virus. At first, Western blotting with the convalescent sera from SARS patients demonstrated that there were various structural proteins of SARS\u2010CoV in the cultured supernatant of virus infected\u2010Vero E6 cells and that nucleocaspid (N) protein had a prominent immunogenicity to the convalescent sera from the patients with SARS, while the immune response of spike (S) protein probably binding with membrane (M) glycoprotein was much weaker. Then, sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2010PAGE) was used to separate the complex protein constituents, and the strategy of continuous slicing from loading well to the bottom of the gels was utilized to search thoroughly the structural proteins of the virus. The proteins in sliced slots were trypsinized in\u2010gel and identified by mass spectrometry. Three structural proteins named S, N and M proteins of SARS\u2010CoV were uncovered with the sequence coverage of 38.9, 93.1 and 28.1% respectively. Glycosylation modification in S protein was also analyzed and four glycosylation sites were discovered by comparing the mass spectra before and after deglycosylation of the peptides with PNGase F digestion. Matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2010mass spectrometry determination showed that relative molecular weight of intact N protein is 45 929 Da, which is very close to its theoretically calculated molecular weight 45 935 Da based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the genome with the first amino acid methionine at the N\u2010terminus depleted and second, serine, acetylated, indicating that phosphorylation does not happen at all in the predicted phosphorylation sites within infected cells nor in virus particles. Intriguingly, a series of shorter isoforms of N protein was observed by SDS\u2010PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry characterization. For further confirmation of this phenomenon and its related mechanism, recombinant N protein of SARS\u2010CoV was cleaved in vitro by caspase\u20103 and \u20106 respectively. The results demonstrated that these shorter isoforms could be the products from cleavage of caspase\u20103 rather than that of caspase\u20106. Further, the relationship between the caspase cleavage and the viral infection to the host cell is discussed.","publish_time":"2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ying, Wantao; Hao, Yunwei; Zhang, Yangjun; Peng, Wenming; Qin, Ede; Cai, Yun; Wei, Kaihua; Wang, Jie; Chang, Guohui; Sun, Wei; Dai, Shujia; Li, Xiaohai; Zhu, Yunping; Li, Jianqi; Wu, Songfeng; Guo, Lihai; Dai, Jingquan; Wang, Jinglan; Wan, Ping; Chen, Tinggui; Du, Chunjuan; Li, Dong; Wan, Jia; Kuai, Xuezhang; Li, Weihua; Shi, Rong; Wei, Handong; Cao, Cheng; Yu, Man; Liu, Hong; Dong, Fangting; Wang, Donggen; Zhang, Xuemin; Qian, Xiaohong; Zhu, Qingyu; He, Fuchu","journal":"Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cf44d7a50d3a18ee0369c92acc661d517ee7a97.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","recombinant N protein of SARS","structural proteins of SARS coronavirus","various structural proteins of SARS","S protein","molecular mechanism of SARS etiology","series of shorter isoforms of N protein","relative molecular weight of intact N protein","infected cells","complex protein constituents","virus particles","cleavage of caspase","caspase cleavage","mass spectrometry determination","mass spectrometry characterization","cultured supernatant of virus infected","mass spectra","Vero E6 cells","convalescent sera","PAGE","SDS","amino acid sequence","glycosylation sites","amino acid methionine","predicted phosphorylation sites","related mechanism","proteomic strategy","new coronavirus","sequence coverage","Glycosylation modification","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","strategy of continuous slicing","nasal","throat swabs","ionization","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","genome","lung tissue of autopsy sample","laser desorption","sodium dodecyl sulfate","deglycosylation","viral infection","BJ","prominent immunogenicity","nucleocaspid","immune response of spike","peptides","phenomenon","terminus","products","PNGase F digestion","insight","Western blotting","causative association","host cell","Matrix","loading","sliced slots","membrane","glycoprotein","confirmation","serine","results","strain","relationship","characteristics","gels"],"language":"en"},

Otitis media predominantly occurs as coincident to viral upper respiratory tract infections and/or bacterial infections. Common viruses that cause upper respiratory tract infection are frequently associated with AOM and new\u2010onset OME. These include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza and coronavirus. Predominant bacteria that cause otitis media are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and non\u2010typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Antibiotic therapy does not significantly benefit most patients with AOM, but long\u2010term prophylactic antibiotic therapy can reduce the risk of otitis media recurrence among children at high risk. In Australia, 84% of AOM is treated with antibiotic therapy, which contributes to development of antibiotic resistance. Vaccine development is a key future direction for reducing the world burden of otitis media, but requires polymicrobial formulation and ongoing monitoring and modification to ensure sustained reduction in disease burden.","publish_time":"2009-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massa, Helen M; Cripps, Allan W; Lehmann, Deborah","journal":"Med J Aust","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/075b2a1d0599c00a409532c3b689efbb155539cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AOM"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["acute otitis media","risk of otitis media recurrence","world burden of otitis media","Diagnostic certainty of otitis media","AOM","development of antibiotic resistance","long\u2010term prophylactic antibiotic therapy","viral upper respiratory tract infections","respiratory syncytial virus","high risk","bacterial infections","disease burden","Vaccine development","variability of symptoms","onset OME","young age of patients","Moraxella catarrhalis","modification","otorrhoea","rhinovirus","adenovirus","polymicrobial formulation","Streptococcus pneumoniae","children","key future direction","ongoing monitoring","sustained reduction","short duration","irritability","non\u2010typeable Haemophilus influenzae","otalgia","fever","Common viruses","accumulation of fluid","parainfluenza","Predominant bacteria","middle ear","coronavirus","effusion","Australia"],"language":"en"},

Among the different types of viruses, those using RNA as their genetic material (RNA viruses and retroviruses) are especially dangerous. At present there is no medicine allowing an effective treatment of RNA\u2010based virus infections. Many RNA viruses and retroviruses need only a few weeks to escape immune response or to produce drug\u2010resistant mutants. This seems to be the obvious consequence of the unusual genetic variability of RNA\u2010based viruses. An individual virus does not form a homogenous population but rather a set of similar but not identical variants. In consequence, RNA\u2010based viruses can easily adapt to environmental changes, also those resulting from immune system response or therapy. The modifications identified within viral genes can be divided into two groups: point mutations and complex genome rearrangements. The former arises mainly during error\u2010prone replication, whereas RNA recombination and generic reassortment are responsible for the latter. This article shortly describes major strategies used to control virus infections. Then, it presents the various mechanisms generating the genetic diversity of RNA\u2010based viruses, which are most probably the main cause of clinical problems. \u00A9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Numerous molecular methods have been used to genetically characterise new viruses without prior in vitro replication or the use of virus\u2010specific reagents. In the recent metagenomic studies viral particles from uncultured environmental and clinical samples have been purified and their nucleic acids randomly amplified prior to subcloning and sequencing. Already known and novel viruses were then identified by comparing their translated sequence to those of viral proteins in public sequence databases. Metagenomic approaches to viral characterisation have been applied to seawater, near shore sediments, faeces, serum, plasma and respiratory secretions and have broadened the range of known viral diversity. Selection of samples with high viral loads, purification of viral particles, removal of cellular nucleic acids, efficient sequence\u2010independent amplification of viral RNA and DNA, recognisable sequence similarities to known viral sequences and deep sampling of the nucleic acid populations through large scale sequencing can all improve the yield of new viruses. This review lists some of the animal viruses recently identified using sequence\u2010independent methods, current laboratory and bioinformatics methods, together with their limitations and potential improvements.

We aimed to analyse the outcomes of a standard treatment strategy comprising antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin, a 3\u2010week step\u2010down course of corticosteroids, and the possibility of pulsed methylprednisolone rescue in the event of deterioration. Methodology: This was a prospective cohort study performed at a major public\u2010funded hospital in Hong Kong. Eighty\u2010eight World Health Organisation/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention probable cases of SARS (97% laboratory\u2010confirmed) were treated with a standard protocol previously reported. Seventy\u2010one patients treated de novo were analysed in detail with regard to time to clinical stabilization after combination treatment, requirement of additional therapy (pulsed methylprednisolone; assisted ventilation); and final outcomes (recovery, mortality). Results: The mean age was 42. Twenty\u2010one patients (24%) had comorbidities. Three of 71 treated de novo recovered with antibiotics alone. The remaining 68 received combination treatment at a mean of 5.8 days after symptom onset, of whom 30 subsequently required pulsed methylprednisolone rescue (independent predictors: older age and higher LDH) and 18 required assisted ventilation (independent predictors: older age, higher oxygen requirement and creatinine level). Their median time to clinical stabilization was 8.0 days after combination treatment (independent predictor for longer time to stabilization: median age of 41 or above). Common complications were hyperglycaemia (58%), pneumo\u2010mediastinum/thoraces (13%), psychiatric manifestations (7%) and ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia (2%). One patient (1%) died of SARS\u2010related respiratory failure. All\u2010cause mortality was 3.4%, occurring in patients aged \u003E 65 years only.

ANIMALS STUDIED: Six adult female cats and the offspring from seven litters. METHODS: Four kittens from uninfected specific pathogen\u2010free (SPF) queens and 21 kittens from SPF queens inoculated at various times late in gestation with Mozart, Maggie, or ME\u201049 strain of T. gondii were used. Ocular examinations were performed on queens prior to and after delivery, and on kittens weekly to bi\u2010weekly for up to 27 weeks. Whole blood for serology was collected from all kittens at 5\u00BD to 8 weeks of age and again at 12 weeks of age or later. RESULTS: No kittens from noninfected queens developed ocular lesions or antibody to T. gondii. Three of the 24 kittens from infected queens died or were euthanized early in the study. Chorioretinitis was detected in 15 of 21 living kittens from infected queens. Two developed concurrent anterior uveitis that resolved within 1 week. Posterior segment lesions varied ophthalmoscopically between strains. Of 21 kittens from T. gondii\u2010infected queens, six developed positive antibody titers to T. gondii during the study. All seropositive kittens were born to queens infected with Mozart strain of T. gondii. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that ocular toxoplasmosis can occur without other evidence of clinical illness in kittens infected in utero or in the neonatal period, and that T. gondii strains may have varying degrees of ocular pathogenicity in cats.","publish_time":"2001-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Powell, Cynthia C.; Lappin, Michael R.","journal":"Vet Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5f28d19cc155d73d630d79d2fd830a733a80b24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169316.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Maggie"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mozart"],"keyphrases":["living kittens","seropositive kittens","SPF queens","gondii strains","noninfected queens","Toxoplasma gondii","ocular lesions","ocular findings","ocular toxoplasmosis","Ocular examinations","study","weeks of age","varying degrees of ocular pathogenicity","Mozart strain","RESULTS","developed positive antibody titers","neonatal infection","neonatal period","developed concurrent anterior uveitis","adult female cats","Posterior segment lesions","uninfected specific pathogen","various times","utero","evidence of clinical illness","offspring","gestation","ANIMALS","disease","Maggie","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","detectable differences","litters","ABSTRACT","CONCLUSION","serology","delivery","blood","Chorioretinitis"],"language":"en"},

In principle, it is straightforward to estimate this quantity from individual follow\u2010up data that provides times from onset to death or recovery. In particular, in a competing risks context, the case fatality ratio is defined by the limiting value of the sub\u2010distribution function, F (1)(t) = Pr(T \u2A7Dt and J = 1), associated with death, as t \u2192 \u221E, where T denotes the time from onset to death (J = 1) or recovery (J = 2). When censoring is present, however, estimation of F (1)(\u221E) is complicated by the possibility of little information regarding the right tail of F (1), requiring use of estimators of F (1)(t(*)) or F (1)(t (*))/(F (1)(t (*))\u002BF (2)(t (*))) where t (*) is large, with F (2)(t) = Pr(T \u2A7Dt and J = 2) being the analogous sub\u2010distribution function associated with recovery. With right censored data, the variability of such estimators increases as t (*) increases, suggesting the possibility of using estimators at lower values of t (*) where bias may be increased but overall mean squared error be smaller. These issues are investigated here for non\u2010parametric estimators of F (1) and F (2). The ideas are illustrated on case fatality data for individuals infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003.

The disease, which is believed to have its origin in the Chinese Guangdong province, spread from Hong Kong via international airports to its current worldwide distribution. The concerted efforts of a globally united scientific community have led to the independent isolation and identification of a novel coronavirus from SARS patients by several groups. The extraordinarily rapid isolation of a causative agent of this newly emerged infectious disease constitutes an unprecedented scientific achievement. The main scope of the article is to provide the clinician with an overview of the natural history, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of SARS. On the basis of the recently published viral genome and structural features common to the members of the coronavirus family, a model for host cell\u2013virus interaction and possible targets for antiviral drugs are presented.

It is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and can have a zoonotic origin. Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E\u2010related conditions. The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries with distinct epidemiologic profiles. In developing countries, the disease is associated with inadequate water treatment, while in developed countries, transmission is associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver. All human HEV are grouped into at least four genotypes, while HEV or HEV\u2010related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species. Despite a high genetic diversity, only one single HEV serotype has been described to date for HEV genotypes 1\u20134. The discovery of new HEV or HEV\u2010related viruses leads to a continuing increase in the number of genotypes. In addition, the genome organization of all these viruses is variable with overlapping open reading frames (ORF) and differences in the location of ORF3. In spite of the role of some domestic and wild animals as reservoir, the origin of HEV and HEV\u2010related viruses in humans and animals is still unclear. This review discusses aspects of the detection, molecular virology, zoonotic transmission and origin of HEV and HEV\u2010related viruses in the context of \u2018One Health\u2019 and establishes a link between the previous and the new taxonomy of this growing virus family.","publish_time":"2015-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiry, D.; Mauroy, A.; Pavio, N.; Purdy, M.

Furthermore, the risk may not be restricted to the recipient, but may have consequences for the health of others in the community.

We therefore aimed to describe its use in clinical practice and predict the risk of mortality for neonates receiving HFOV. A retrospective observational study of all neonates treated with HFOV in a quaternary referral NICU between January 2007 and December 2016 was conducted. We classified these patients into five subgroups based on primary respiratory diagnoses. We performed the logistic regression and decision tree regression analyses to identify independent factors of 30-day mortality following HFOV. A total of 1125 patients who were ever supported on HFOV were enrolled, of whom 64.1% received HFOV as a rescue therapy, 27.2% received it as an elective therapy, and 8.7% received it for air leak. An average oxygenation index (OI) greater than 25 in the first 24 hours after the initiation of HFOV and patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension were found to have the greatest risk of in-hospital mortality (p \u003C 0.0001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 25.8% (290/1125). Decision tree regression analysis revealed that neonates with refractory respiratory failure who had a pre-HFOV OI value higher than 20.5 and OI values higher than 21.5, 23.5 and 34 at 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours after the use of HFOV, respectively, had a significantly increased risk of 30-day mortality. We identified the predictors and cutoff points of OI before and after the initiation of HFOV in neonates with respiratory failure, which can be clinically used as a reference for 30-day mortality.

P. falciparum merozoite Rh5 interacting protein (PfRipr) forms a complex with Rh5 and CyRPA in sequential molecular events leading to erythrocyte invasion. Recently we described PfRipr as a conserved protein that induces strain-transcending growth inhibitory antibodies in in vitro assays. However, being a large and complex protein of 1086 amino acids (aa) with 87 cysteine residues, PfRipr is difficult to express in conventional expression systems towards vaccine development. In this study we sought to identify the most potent region of PfRipr that could be developed to overcome difficulties related to protein expression, as well as to elucidate the invasion inhibitory mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies. Using the wheat germ cell-free system, Ecto- PfRipr and truncates of approximately 200 aa were expressed as soluble proteins. We demonstrate that antibodies against PfRipr truncate 5 (PfRipr_5: C(720)-D(934)), a region within the PfRipr C-terminal EGF-like domains, potently inhibit merozoite invasion. Furthermore, the antibodies strongly block PfRipr/Rh5 interaction, as well as that between PfRipr and its erythrocyte-surface receptor, SEMA7A. Taken together, PfRipr_5 is a potential candidate for further development as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagaoka, Hikaru; Kanoi, Bernard N.; Ntege, Edward H.; Aoki, Masamitsu; Fukushima, Akihisa; Tsuboi, Takafumi; Takashima, Eizo","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e78572878c3d82223e95fda7868cc8cdbecac37a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171142.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PfRipr"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ecto- PfRipr","potent region of PfRipr","invasion inhibitory mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies","PfRipr C-terminal EGF","complex protein","erythrocyte invasion","protein expression","falciparum merozoite Rh5","conserved protein","Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion","blood-stage malaria vaccine","vaccine development","Rh5 interaction","strain-transcending growth inhibitory antibodies","blood-stage cycle","malaria pathogenesis","conventional expression systems","erythrocyte-surface receptor","sequential molecular events","erythrocytes","essential step","survival of parasites","wheat germ cell-free system","CyRPA","amino acids","domains","cysteine residues","assays","potential candidate","SEMA7A","soluble proteins","difficulties","study"],"language":"en"},

A large number of fungal viruses are associated with latent infections of their hosts. With the exception of the killer-immune character in the yeasts, smuts, and hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus, fungal properties that can specifically be related to virus infection are not well defined. Mycoviruses are not known to have natural vectors; they are transmitted in nature intracellularly by hyphal anastomosis and heterokaryosis, and are disseminated via spores. Because fungi have a potential for plasmogamy and cytoplasmic exchange during extended periods of their life cycles and because they produce many types of propagules (sexual and asexual spores), often in great profusion, mycoviruses have them accessible to highly efficient means for transmission and spread. It is no surprise, therefore, that fungal viruses are not known to have an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Although extracellular transmission of a few fungal viruses have been demonstrated, using fungal protoplasts, the lack of conventional methods for experimental transmission of these viruses have been, and remains, an obstacle to understanding their biology. The recent application of molecular biological approaches to the study of mycoviral dsRNAs and the improvements in DNA-mediated fungal transformation systems, have allowed a clearer understanding of the molecular biology of mycoviruses to emerge. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the genome organization and expression strategies of the yeast L-A virus and the unencapsidated RNA virus associated with hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus. These recent advances in the biochemical and molecular characterization of the genomes of fungal viruses and associated satellite dsRNAs, as they relate to the biological properties of these viruses and to their interactions with their hosts are the focus of this chapter.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghabrial, Said A.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genomes of fungal viruses","fungal properties","fungal protoplasts","large number of fungal viruses","fungal transformation systems","hosts","molecular biology of mycoviruses","extracellular transmission","biological properties","hypovirulence","molecular characterization","recent application of molecular biological approaches","chestnut blight fungus","experimental transmission","life cycles","biological significance","virus infection","associated satellite dsRNAs","fungi","unencapsidated RNA virus","asexual spores","recent advances","clearer understanding","extracellular phase","study of mycoviral dsRNAs","plasmogamy","extended periods","DNA","improvements","lack of conventional methods","cytoplasmic exchange","yeasts","smuts","killer-immune character","great profusion","nature","expression strategies","heterokaryosis","types of propagules","potential","latent infections","genome organization","efficient means","hyphal anastomosis","exception","focus","interactions","natural vectors","chapter","surprise","Considerable progress","obstacle"],"language":"en"},

A critical pitfall which can lead to erroneous or invalid results is contamination of the CSF by even minute quantities of blood. Means of avoiding this contamination are attention to anatomical reference points, the use of a micropipet, and prior intracardiac perfusion of animals with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells in the CSF were typed as either B, T, polymorphonuclear, or mononuclear cells by the combination of a microcytotoxicity assay and histologic stains. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) allowed quantification of antibodies to JHMV in the CSF and indicated the presence of intrathecal synthesis of antibody in chronically infected mice.

The annual incidence and prevalence of cancer in Germany is rising. Although modern treatments have generally led to improved survival, increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty of the patients require multidisciplinary strategies for handling complex therapeutic concepts and treatment of the associated complications. METHODS: A selective literature search and guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00FCr H\u00E4matologie und Medizinische Onkologie, DGHO), the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the DGHO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Infektionen in der H\u00E4matologie und Onkologie, AGIHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) formed the basis of this study. CONCLUSION: Recognition of severe infections in cancer patients and their discrimination from treatment-associated complications is a challenge. Neutropenic fever is the most frequent infectious emergency in oncology. Early empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and escalated diagnostic strategies are needed to successfully treat this vulnerable patient group.

In this review we will present a brief history of RNAi, methods of inducing RNAi, application of RNAi in the therapeutic setting, and the possibilities of using this highly promising approach in the context of transplantation.","publish_time":"2004-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ichim, Thomas E.; Li, Mu; Qian, Hua; Popov, Igor A.; Rycerz, Katarzyna; Zheng, Xiufen; White, David; Zhong, Robert; Min, Wei\u2010Ping","journal":"Am J Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecadf760eec5db370f902e16329f2fe48d7697ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175948.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175948/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["application of RNAi","Induction of RNAi","methods of inducing RNAi","brief history of RNAi","stranded RNA","RNA interference","small interfering RNA","administration of siRNA","promising approach","double strand","antibodies","approaches","antisense oligonucleotides","selective silencing of genes","homology","activation of cellular pathways","process","mediated therapeutics","viral infections","pharmacological inhibitors","treatment of hepatitis","possibilities","therapeutic setting","excitement","cancer","context of transplantation","shortcomings"],"language":"en"},

Patterns in the occurrence of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species in 59 sites located in remnant urban habitat fragments of Brisbane City were assessed against local\u2010level environmental characteristics of each site. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling ordination, and principal axis correlation were used to investigate relationships between species\u0027 occurrences and environmental characteristics. Native reptiles were most strongly associated with the presence of termite mounds, a high amount of fallen woody material, and a moderate amount of weed cover. Native small mammals were most strongly associated with the presence of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp.), and both reptiles and small mammals were negatively influenced by increased soil compaction. Significant floristic characteristics were considered to be important as structural, rather than compositional, habitat elements. Therefore, habitat structure, rather than vegetation composition, appears to be most important for determining native, terrestrial reptile and small mammal species assemblages in urban forest fragments. We discuss the management implications in relation to human disturbances and local\u2010level management of urban remnants.","publish_time":"2007-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"GARDEN, JENNI G.; MCALPINE, CLIVE A.; POSSINGHAM, HUGH P.; JONES, DARRYL N.","journal":"Austral Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfaeeaddeb65011d6a873d35db972d986ab8a0a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175953.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175953/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Native small mammals","Native reptiles","urban environments","urban areas","native wildlife","level management of urban remnants","level habitat attributes","urban forest fragments","level environmental characteristics","occurrence of native terrestrial reptile","habitat structure","habitat elements","remnant urban habitat fragments of Brisbane City","small mammal species assemblages","Significant floristic characteristics","management implications","species\u0027 responses","species\u0027 occurrences","presence of grass trees","presence of termite mounds","human disturbances","multidimensional scaling ordination","sites","relationships","order","principal axis correlation","decision\u2010making process","ability","Cluster analysis","Xanthorrhoea","ground conservation actions","vegetation composition","woody material","agricultural landscapes","increased soil compaction","Patterns","weed cover"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the association between receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and prematurity and small for gestational age (SGA) births. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cohort analysis of surveillance data from the Georgia (United States) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Among 4,326 live births between 1 June 2004 and 30 September 2006, maternal influenza vaccine information was available for 4,168 (96.3%). The primary intervention evaluated in this study was receipt of influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy. The main outcome measures were prematurity (gestational age at birth \u003C37 wk) and SGA (birth weight \u003C10th percentile for gestational age). Infants who were born during the putative influenza season (1 October\u201331 May) and whose mothers were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy were less likely to be premature compared to infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38\u20130.94). The magnitude of association between maternal influenza vaccine receipt and reduced likelihood of prematurity increased during the period of at least local influenza activity (adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26\u20130.73) and was greatest during the widespread influenza activity period (adjusted OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11\u20130.74). Compared with newborns of unvaccinated women, newborns of vaccinated mothers had 69% lower odds of being SGA (adjusted OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13\u20130.75) during the period of widespread influenza activity. The adjusted and unadjusted ORs were not significant for the pre-influenza activity period. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an association between immunization with the inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and reduced likelihood of prematurity during local, regional, and widespread influenza activity periods. However, no associations were found for the pre-influenza activity period. Moreover, during the period of widespread influenza activity there was an association between maternal receipt of influenza vaccine and reduced likelihood of SGA birth.

Most DENV-specific hMAbs were serotype cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing. Moreover, many hMAbs bound to the viral pre-membrane protein and other sites on the virus that were not preserved when the viral envelope protein was produced as a soluble, recombinant antigen (rE protein). Nonetheless, by modifying the screening procedure to detect rare antibodies that bound to rE, we were able to isolate and map human antibodies that strongly neutralized the homologous serotype of DENV.

There is little information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza in South America. Here we provide a quantitative description of the age-specific morbidity pandemic patterns across administrative areas of Peru. METHODS: We used daily cases of influenza-like-illness, tests for A/H1N1 influenza virus infections, and laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases reported to the epidemiological surveillance system of Peru\u0027s Ministry of Health from May 1 to December 31, 2009. We analyzed the geographic spread of the pandemic waves and their association with the winter school vacation period, demographic factors, and absolute humidity. We also estimated the reproduction number and quantified the association between the winter school vacation period and the age distribution of cases. RESULTS: The national pandemic curve revealed a bimodal winter pandemic wave, with the first peak limited to school age children in the Lima metropolitan area, and the second peak more geographically widespread. The reproduction number was estimated at 1.6\u20132.2 for the Lima metropolitan area and 1.3\u20131.5 in the rest of Peru. We found a significant association between the timing of the school vacation period and changes in the age distribution of cases, while earlier pandemic onset was correlated with large population size. By contrast there was no association between pandemic dynamics and absolute humidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate substantial spatial variation in pandemic patterns across Peru, with two pandemic waves of varying timing and impact by age and region. Moreover, the Peru data suggest a hierarchical transmission pattern of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 driven by large population centers. The higher reproduction number of the first pandemic wave could be explained by high contact rates among school-age children, the age group most affected during this early wave.","publish_time":"2011-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, Gerardo; Viboud, C\u00E9cile; Munayco, Cesar V.; G\u00F3mez, Jorge; Simonsen, Lone; Miller, Mark A.; Tamerius, James; Fiestas, Victor; Halsey, Eric S.; Laguna-Torres, Victor A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51b2c04a95156d66aec99817f2dc769566cace9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3119673.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3119673/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South America","Peru"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 influenza pandemic","pandemic dynamics","spatial-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza","national pandemic curve","earlier pandemic onset","bimodal winter pandemic wave","age-specific morbidity pandemic patterns","school age children","school-age children","H1N1 influenza cases","pandemic waves of varying timing","hierarchical transmission pattern of pandemic influenza","age distribution of cases","age group","daily cases of influenza","winter school vacation period","H1N1 influenza virus infections","Peru data","significant association","rest of Peru","higher reproduction number","administrative areas of Peru","RESULTS","peak","early wave","absolute humidity","Lima metropolitan area","substantial spatial variation","refined surveillance data","large population size","large population centers","temporal characteristics","epidemiological surveillance system of Peru\u0027s Ministry of Health","demographic factors","impact","laboratory","changes","high contact rates","tests","South America","illness","quantitative description","little information","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","region","geographic spread","METHODS","contrast"],"language":"en"},

R (0) has been widely used as a measure of disease strength to estimate the effectiveness of control measures and to form the backbone of disease-management policy. However, in almost every aspect that matters, R (0) is flawed. Diseases can persist with R (0) \u003C 1, while diseases with R (0) \u003E 1 can die out. We show that the same model of malaria gives many different values of R (0), depending on the method used, with the sole common property that they have a threshold at 1. We also survey estimated values of R (0) for a variety of diseases, and examine some of the alternatives that have been proposed.

The genomic diversity of viral quasispecies is a subject of great interest, particularly for chronic infections, since it can lead to resistance to existing therapies.

RESULTS: In this paper, we introduce a new Viral Spectrum Assembler (ViSpA) method for quasispecies spectrum reconstruction and compare it with the state-of-the-art ShoRAH tool on both simulated and real 454 pyrosequencing shotgun reads from HCV and HIV quasispecies. Experimental results show that ViSpA outperforms ShoRAH on simulated error-free reads, correctly assembling 10 out of 10 quasispecies and 29 sequences out of 40 quasispecies. While ShoRAH has a significant advantage over ViSpA on reads simulated with sequencing errors due to its advanced error correction algorithm, ViSpA is better at assembling the simulated reads after they have been corrected by ShoRAH. ViSpA also outperforms ShoRAH on real 454 reads. Indeed, 7 most frequent sequences reconstructed by ViSpA from a real HCV dataset are viable (do not contain internal stop codons), and the most frequent sequence was within 1% of the actual open reading frame obtained by cloning and Sanger sequencing. In contrast, only one of the sequences reconstructed by ShoRAH is viable. On a real HIV dataset, ShoRAH correctly inferred only 2 quasispecies sequences with at most 4 mismatches whereas ViSpA correctly reconstructed 5 quasispecies with at most 2 mismatches, and 2 out of 5 sequences were inferred without any mismatches. ViSpA source code is available at http://alla.cs.gsu.edu/~software/VISPA/vispa.html. CONCLUSIONS: ViSpA enables accurate viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction from 454 pyrosequencing reads. We are currently exploring extensions applicable to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from bacterial metagenomic samples and ecological samples of eukaryote populations.","publish_time":"2011-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Astrovskaya, Irina; Tork, Bassam; Mangul, Serghei; Westbrooks, Kelly; M\u0103ndoiu, Ion; Balfe, Peter; Zelikovsky, Alex","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc376b339ab3aed1e518e9c8e7bb5e95f51443c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3194189.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194189/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related quasispecies sequences","HIV quasispecies","simulated reads","related sequences","frequent sequences","genomic diversity of viral quasispecies","accurate viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction","ViSpA source code","simulated error-free reads","viral diversity","state-of-the-art ShoRAH tool","mismatches","High-throughput sequencing","real HCV dataset","real HIV dataset","sequencing errors","Sanger sequencing","throughput sequencing data","new Viral Spectrum Assembler","analysis of high","pyrosequencing shotgun","Experimental results","bacterial metagenomic samples","standard assembly software","single genome assembly","ecological samples of eukaryote populations","advanced error correction algorithm","method","cloning","promising approach","actual open reading frame","subject of great","host","abundance of multiple","CONCLUSIONS","significant advantage","BACKGROUND","RNA viruses","internal stop codons","extensions applicable","paper","resistance","existing therapies","chronic infections","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The recent elucidation of the genome, proteome and transcriptome of many of these complex pathogens provides the basis for rational vaccine design by identifying, on a proteome-wide scale, novel target antigens that are recognized by T cells and antibodies from exposed individuals. However, there is currently no algorithm to effectively identify important target antigens from genome sequence data; this is especially challenging for T cell targets. Furthermore, for some of these pathogens, such as Plasmodium, protein expression using conventional platforms has been problematic but cell-free in vitro transcription translation (IVTT) strategies have recently proved successful. Herein, we report a novel approach for proteome-wide scale identification of the antigenic targets of T cell responses using IVTT products. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments using IVTT proteins either unpurified, absorbed to carboxylated polybeads, or affinity purified through nickel resin or magnetic beads. In vitro studies in humans using CMV, EBV, and Influenza A virus proteins showed antigen-specific cytokine production in ELIspot and Cytometric Bead Array assays with cells stimulated with purified or unpurified IVTT antigens. In vitro and in vivo studies in mice immunized with the Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite DNA vaccine with or without IVTT protein boost showed antigen-specific cytokine production using purified IVTT antigens only. Overall, the nickel resin method of IVTT antigen purification proved optimal in both human and murine systems. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides proof of concept for the potential of high-throughput approaches to identify T cell targets of complex parasitic, viral or bacterial pathogens from genomic sequence data, for rational vaccine development against emerging and re-emerging diseases that pose a threat to public health.","publish_time":"2011-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cardoso, Fernanda C.; Roddick, Joanne S.; Groves, Penny; Doolan, Denise L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d91cc711f18ce05f6d63c11760e3ff4fd88928a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3214079.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3214079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzExMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IVTT","Cytometric Bead Array"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IVTT proteins","unpurified IVTT antigens","IVTT products","IVTT protein boost","T cells","T cell targets of complex parasitic","complex pathogens","rational vaccine development","nickel resin method of IVTT antigen purification","novel target antigens","antigenic targets of T cell responses","complex diseases","cell-free","rational vaccine design","important target antigens","antigen-specific cytokine production","genome sequence data","proteome-wide scale identification","bacterial pathogens","studies","Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite DNA vaccine","genomic sequence data","re-emerging diseases","protein expression","virus proteins","novel approach","ELIspot","Cytometric Bead Array assays","EBV","conventional platforms","transcription translation","Influenza","throughput","malaria","basis","proof of concept","potential of high","CMV","threat","affinity","mice","strategies","challenge","antibodies","exposed individuals","experiments","transcriptome","magnetic beads","series of","work","murine systems","humans","polybeads","recent elucidation","BACKGROUND","algorithm","public health","scientific community","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the impact of the H1N1 2009 influenza virus on ICU services during the second (2010) winter, following the implementation of vaccination. METHODS: A prospective, cohort study was conducted in all ANZ ICUs during the southern hemisphere winter of 2010. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, including vaccination status and outcomes, were collected. The characteristics of patients admitted during the 2010 and 2009 seasons were compared. RESULTS: From 1 June to 15 October 2010, there were 315 patients with confirmed influenza A, of whom 283 patients (90%) had H1N1 2009 (10.6 cases per million inhabitants; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.4 to 11.9) which was an observed incidence of 33% of that in 2009 (P \u003C 0.001). The maximum daily ICU occupancy was 2.4 beds (95% CI, 1.8 to 3) per million inhabitants in 2010 compared with 7.5 (95% CI, 6.5 to 8.6) in 2009, (P \u003C 0.001). The onset of the epidemic in 2010 was delayed by five weeks compared with 2009. The clinical characteristics were similar in 2010 and 2009 with no difference in the age distribution, proportion of patients treated with mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission, or hospital mortality. Unlike 2009 the incidence of critical illness was significantly greater in New Zealand (18.8 cases per million inhabitants compared with 9 in Australia, P \u003C 0.001). Of 170 patients with known vaccination status, 26 (15.3%) had been vaccinated against H1N1 2009.

Both processes are regulated by RNA sequences such as the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), and the transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) of the leader (TRS-L) and those preceding each gene (TRS-Bs). These distant RNA regulatory sequences interact with each other directly and probably through protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions involving viral and cellular proteins.1 By analogy to other plus-stranded RNA viruses, such as polioviruses, in which translation and replication switch involves a cellular factor (PCBP) and a viral protein (3CD),2 it is conceivable that in CoVs the switch between replication and transcription is also associated with the binding of proteins that are specifically recruited by the replication or transcription complexes. Complexes between RNA motifs such as TRS-L and the TRS-Bs located along the CoV genome are probably formed previously to the transcription start, and most likely promote template-switch of the nascent minus RNA to the TRS-L region.3 Many cellular proteins interacting with regulatory CoV RNA sequences4 are members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of RNA-binding proteins, involved in mRNA processing and transport, which shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the context of CoV RNA synthesis, these cellular ribonucleoproteins might also participate in RNA-protein complexes to bring into physical proximity TRS-L and distant TRS-B, as proposed for CoV discontinuous transcription.5\u20137 In this review, we summarize RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that represent modest examples of complex quaternary RNA-protein structures required for the fine-tuning of virus replication.

The objective of this study was to measure healthcare utilization patterns in Guatemala to inform the establishment of a sentinel surveillance system for influenza and other respiratory infections, and allow estimation of disease burden. METHODS: We used a stratified, two-stage cluster survey sample to select 1200 households from the Department of Santa Rosa. Trained interviewers screened household residents for self-reported pneumonia in the last year and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the last month and asked about healthcare utilization for each illness episode. RESULTS: We surveyed 1131 (94%) households and 5449 residents between October and December 2006 and identified 323 (6%) cases of pneumonia and 628 (13%) cases of ILI. Treatment for pneumonia outside the home was sought by 92% of the children \u003C5 years old and 73% of the persons aged five years and older.

Isothermal amplification methods, such as reverse-transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for POC settings, since they are typically quicker, easier to perform, and allow for integration into low-tech, portable heating devices. METHODOLOGY/SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: In this study, we evaluated the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay using portable, non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heating devices that generate heat from the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water. The NINA heating devices exhibited stable temperatures throughout the amplification reaction and consistent amplification results between three separate devices and a thermalcycler. The performance of the NINA heaters was validated using whole blood specimens from HIV-1 infected patients. CONCLUSION: The RT-LAMP isothermal amplification method used in conjunction with a chemical heating device provides a portable, rapid and robust NAAT platform that has the potential to facilitate HIV-1 testing in resource-limited settings and POC.","publish_time":"2012-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curtis, Kelly A.; Rudolph, Donna L.; Nejad, Irene; Singleton, Jered; Beddoe, Andy; Weigl, Bernhard; LaBarre, Paul; Owen, S.

The present study was designed to investigate whether the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DC-SIGN, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genes influence the risk of developing Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA). Twenty-seven SNPs were selected using a hybrid functional/tagging approach and genotyped in 182 haematological patients, fifty-seven of them diagnosed with proven or probable IPA according to the 2008 EORTC/MSG criteria. Association analysis revealed that carriers of the Dectin-1 (rs3901533 T/T) and Dectin-1 (rs7309123 G/G) genotypes and DC-SIGN (rs4804800 G), DC-SIGN (rs11465384 T), DC-SIGN (7248637 A) and DC-SIGN (7252229 C) alleles had a significantly increased risk of IPA infection (OR = 5.59 95%CI 1.37\u201322.77; OR = 4.91 95%CI 1.52\u201315.89; OR = 2.75 95%CI 1.27\u20135.95; OR = 2.70 95%CI 1.24\u20135.90; OR = 2.39 95%CI 1.09\u20135.22 and OR = 2.05 95%CI 1.00\u20134.22, respectively). There was also a significantly increased frequency of galactomannan positivity among patients carrying the Dectin-1 (rs3901533_T) allele and Dectin-1 (rs7309123_G/G) genotype. In addition, healthy individuals with this latter genotype showed a significantly decreased level of Dectin-1 mRNA expression compared to C-allele carriers, suggesting a role of the Dectin-1 (rs7309123) polymorphism in determining the levels of Dectin-1 and, consequently, the level of susceptibility to IPA infection. SNP-SNP interaction (epistasis) analysis revealed significant interactions models including SNPs in Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genes, with synergistic genetic effects. Although these results need to be further validated in larger cohorts, they suggest that Dectin-1, DC-SIGN, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genetic variants influence the risk of IPA infection and might be useful in developing a risk-adapted prophylaxis.","publish_time":"2012-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sainz, Juan; Lupi\u00E1\u00F1ez, Carmen Bel\u00E9n; Segura-Catena, Juana; Vazquez, Lourdes; R\u00EDos, Rafael; Oyonarte, Salvador; Hemminki, Kari; F\u00F6rsti, Asta; Jurado, Manuel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cc4711e7794e52f303fdd8557dd175e71989c7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3288082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3288082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPA","Association","G/G"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["level of Dectin","levels of Dectin","DC-SIGN","CCL2","rs7309123 G","increased risk of IPA infection","CCR2 genes","SNPs","rs4804800 G","rs3901533 T","probable IPA","CCR2 axis","rs11465384 T","CCR2 genetic variants","C-allele carriers","risk-adapted prophylaxis","C-type lectins","SNP-SNP interaction","Association analysis","haematological patients","level of susceptibility","synergistic genetic effects","increased frequency of galactomannan positivity","epistasis","critical steps","significant interactions models","derived structures","genotypes","mRNA expression","chemotactic activity","host immune response","tagging approach","presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms","Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis","hybrid functional","EORTC","alleles","recognition of pathogen","fungi","healthy individuals","role","addition","MSG criteria","larger cohorts","present study","results"],"language":"en"},

We present our experience with H1N1-associated ARDS and successful bridging of lung function using superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) in combination with continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing (CPAP/ASB). METHODS: We admitted five patients with H1N1 infection and ARDS to our intensive care unit. Although all patients required pure oxygen and controlled ventilation, oxygenation was insufficient. We applied SHFJV/CPAP/ASB to improve oxygenation. RESULTS: Initial PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio prior SHFJV was 58-79 mmHg. In all patients, successful oxygenation was achieved by SHFJV (PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio 105-306 mmHg within 24 h). Spontaneous breathing was set during first hours after admission. SHFJV could be stopped after 39, 40, 72, 100, or 240 h. Concomitant pulmonary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was observed in all patients. Two patients were successfully discharged. The other three patients relapsed and died within 7 weeks mainly due to combined HSV infection and in two cases reoccurring H1N1 infection.

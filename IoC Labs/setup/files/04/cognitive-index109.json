Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that co-infection by rhinovirus and influenza virus may reduce disease severity and that they may also interfere with each other\u2019s spread within a host population. To determine how co-infection by these two unrelated respiratory viruses affects pathogenesis, we established a mouse model using a minor serogroup rhinovirus (RV1B) and mouse-adapted influenza A virus (PR8). Infection of mice with RV1B two days before PR8 reduced pathogenesis of mild to moderate, but not severe PR8 infections. Disease attenuation was associated with an early inflammatory response in the lungs and enhanced clearance of PR8. However, co-infection by RV1B did not reduce PR8 viral loads early in infection or inhibit replication of PR8 within respiratory epithelia or in vitro. Inflammation in co-infected mice remained focal, in comparison to diffuse inflammation and damage in the lungs of mice infected by PR8. These findings suggest that RV1B stimulates an early immune response that clears PR8 while limiting excessive pulmonary inflammation. The timing of RV1B co-infection was a critical determinant of protection, suggesting that sufficient time is needed to induce this response. Finally, disease attenuation was not unique to RV1B: co-infection by a murine coronavirus two days before PR8 also reduced disease severity. This model will be critical for understanding the mechanisms responsible for attenuation of influenza disease during co-infection by unrelated respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2018-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez, Andres J.; Ijezie, Emmanuel C.; Balemba, Onesmo B.; Miura, Tanya A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f32841f22efe8c2bccd0d04a0c0b47e6ecf86b61.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2f58dac89ab3cbeb6bc381b9b51d3f64e7160098.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/326546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["timing of RV1B co-infection","Infection of mice","replication of PR8","co-pathogens","co-infected mice","PR8 viral loads","attenuation of influenza disease","severe PR8 infections","Disease attenuation","enhanced clearance of PR8","Influenza viruses","disease severity","unrelated respiratory viruses","respiratory epithelia","lungs of mice","mouse-adapted influenza","early inflammatory response","early immune response","days","mouse model","large number of acute respiratory viral infections","excessive pulmonary inflammation","mechanisms responsible","pathogenesis of mild","minor serogroup rhinovirus","critical determinant of protection","human populations","murine coronavirus","comparison","rhinoviruses","epidemiological studies","damage","sufficient time","spread","host population","hosts","findings"],"language":"en"},

For the first time, Isatis tinctoria L. hairy root cultures were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet-A, ultraviolet-B, and ultraviolet-C) in an attempt to promote the production of pharmacologically active flavonoids. Results showed that the maximum flavonoid accumulation (7259.12 \u00B1 198.19 \u03BCg/g DW) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures treated by 108 kJ/m2 dose of UV-B radiation increased 16.51-fold as compared with that in control (439.68 \u00B1 8.27 \u03BCg/g DW). Additionally, antioxidant activity enhancement and cell wall reinforcement were found in the treated I. tinctoria hairy root cultures, indicating the positive-feedback responses to oxidative stress mediated by ultraviolet-B radiation. Moreover, the expression of chalcone synthase gene was tremendously up-regulated (up to 405.84-fold) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures following ultraviolet-B radiation, which suggested chalcone synthase gene might play a crucial role in flavonoid augmentation. Overall, the present work provides a feasible approach for the enhanced production of biologically active flavonoids in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures via the simple supplementation of ultraviolet-B radiation, which is useful for the biotechnological production of these high-added value compounds to fulfil the ever-increasing demand in pharmaceutical fields.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiao, Jiao; Gai, Qing-Yan; Yao, Li-Ping; Niu, Li-Li; Zang, Yu-Ping; Fu, Yu-Jie","journal":"Industrial Crops and Products","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05f12560f9f9407c2aadddb5988fb2983dc74fdc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127274.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288266/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926669018302693; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.03.046; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669018302693","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ultraviolet radiation","ultraviolet-B radiation","tinctoria hairy root cultures","ultraviolet-C","simple supplementation of ultraviolet","Isatis tinctoria","enhanced production","active flavonoids","biotechnological production","\u03BCg","g DW","fold","expression of chalcone synthase gene","maximum flavonoid accumulation","accumulation of phytochemicals","flavonoid augmentation","pharmaceutical fields","oxidative stress","kJ","cell wall reinforcement","positive-feedback responses","crucial role","m2 dose of UV","antioxidant activity enhancement","ever-increasing demand","feasible approach","plant","value compounds","time","Abstract Search of cost-effective strategies","present work","Results","essential task","attempt","control"],"language":"en"},

The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez-Sanguino, Clara; Aus\u00EDn, Berta; \u00C1ngelCastellanos, Miguel; Saiz, Jes\u00FAs; L\u00F3pez-G\u00F3mez, A\u00EDda; Ugidos, Carolina; Mu\u00F1oz, Manuel","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4295245546f258d90caf737fd52297ce340bc712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219372.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120308126?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120308126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405150/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anxiety","PTSD symptoms","Covid","pandemic","loneliness","social support","greater symptomatology","spiritual well-being","health emergency","psychological impact","presence of depression","sample","need of greater psychological support","strongest predictor of depression","previous diagnoses of mental health problems","Predictive models","cross-sectional study","related data","linear regression models","economic stability","greatest protector","post-traumatic stress disorder","neurological disorders","discrimination","female gender","older age group","belief","adequate information","scientific literature","outbreak","online survey","sense of belonging","vulnerable groups","Descriptive analyses","Spanish population","weeks","people","virus","measures","screening tests","variables","depressive","addition"],"language":"en"},

ProS is subsequently processed into two C-terminal proteins of \u223C110 and \u223C80 kDa. The membrane-bound proprotein convertases (PCs) furin, PC7 or PC5B enhanced the production of the \u223C80 kDa protein.

In addition, inhibition of processing by dec-RVKR-cmk completely abrogated the virus-induced cellular cytopathicity.

Influenza virus HA is synthesised as a precursor protein in infected cells and requires cleavage by host cell proteases to transit into an active form. Cleavage is essential for influenza virus infectivity and the HA\u2010processing proteases are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. It is well established that cleavage by ubiquitously expressed subtilisin\u2010like proteases is a hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV). In contrast, the nature of the proteases responsible for cleavage of HA of human influenza viruses and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) is not well understood. Recent studies suggest that cleavage of HA of human influenza viruses might be a cell\u2010associated event and might be facilitated by the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and human airway trypsin\u2010like protease (HAT). Here, we will introduce the different concepts established for proteolytic activation of influenza virus HA, with a particular focus on the role of TTSPs, and we will discuss their implications for viral tropism, pathogenicity and antiviral intervention.

Although broadly reactive antibodies against these antigens could be useful as therapeutics and in vaccine design, their identification has proven elusive. Here, we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that recognize erythrocytes infected by different P. falciparum isolates and opsonize these cells by binding to members of the RIFIN family. These antibodies acquired broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large DNA fragment between the V and DJ segments. The insert, which is both necessary and sufficient for binding to RIFINs, encodes the entire 100 amino acid collagen-binding domain of LAIR-1, an Ig superfamily inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 19. In each of the two donors studied, the antibodies are produced by a single expanded B cell clone and carry distinct somatic mutations in the LAIR-1 domain that abolish binding to collagen and increase binding to infected erythrocytes. These findings illustrate, with a biologically relevant example, a novel mechanism of antibody diversification by interchromosomal DNA transposition and demonstrate the existence of conserved epitopes that may be suitable candidates for the development of a malaria vaccine.","publish_time":"2015-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Joshua; Pieper, Kathrin; Piccoli, Luca; Abdi, Abdirahman; Perez, Mathilde Foglierini; Geiger, Roger; Tully, Claire Maria; Jarrossay, David; Maina Ndungu, Francis; Wambua, Juliana; Bejon, Philip; Fregni, Chiara Silacci; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Blanca; Barbieri, Sonia; Bianchi, Siro; Marsh, Kevin; Thathy, Vandana; Corti, Davide; Sallusto, Federica; Bull, Peter; Lanzavecchia, Antonio","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18d51b527546f388651b7d1322d9a9538c333b61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4869849.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature16450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host antibodies","reactive antibodies","surface of infected erythrocytes","amino acid collagen-binding domain of LAIR","isolation of human monoclonal antibodies","malaria vaccine","novel mechanism of insertion","Plasmodium falciparum antigens","novel mechanism of antibody diversification","falciparum isolates","vaccine design","interchromosomal DNA transposition","large DNA fragment","distinct somatic mutations","single expanded B cell clone","pathogen","important targets","powerful means of escape","RIFINs","existence of conserved epitopes","suitable candidates","Ig superfamily inhibitory receptor","high number","broad reactivity","chromosome","variability","immunity","development","therapeutics","members","relevant example","cells","DJ segments","identification","RIFIN family","findings","donors"],"language":"en"},

A distinct structural feature, where structural segments in a protein dimer or higher oligomer were shared between two or more chains of a protein structure, characterizes 3D domain swapping. 3D domain swapping was observed as a key mediator of numerous functional mechanisms and play pathogenic role in various diseases including conformational diseases like amyloidosis, Alzheimer\u0027s disease, Parkinson\u0027s disease and prion diseases. We report the first study with a focus on identifying functional classes, pathways and diseases mediated by 3D domain swapping in the human proteome. METHODS: We used a panel of four enrichment tools with two different ontologies and two annotations database to derive biological and clinical relevant information associated with 3D domain swapping. Protein domain enrichment analysis followed by Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed the functional repertoire of proteins involved in swapping. Pathway analysis using KEGG annotations revealed diverse pathway associations of human proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. Disease Ontology was used to find statistically significant associations with proteins in swapped conformation and various disease categories (P-value \u003C 0.05). RESULTS: We report meta-analysis results of a literature-curated dataset of human gene products involved in 3D domain swapping and discuss new insights about the functional repertoire, pathway associations and disease implications of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrated bioinformatics pipeline comprising of four different enrichment tools, two ontologies and two annotations revealed new insights into the functional and disease correlations with 3D domain swapping. GO term enrichment were used to infer terms associated with three different GO categories. Protein domain enrichment was used to identify conserved domains enriched in swapped proteins. Pathway enrichment analysis using KEGG annotations revealed that proteins with swapped conformations are present in all six classes of KEGG BRITE hierarchy and significantly enriched KEGG pathways were observed in five classes. Five major classes of disease were found to be associated with 3D domain swapping using functional disease ontology based enrichment analysis. Five classes of human diseases: cancer, diseases of the respiratory or pulmonary system, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system, vascular disease and encephalitis were found to be significant. In conclusion, our study shows that bioinformatics based analytical approaches using curated data can enhance the understanding of functional and disease implications of 3D domain swapping.","publish_time":"2012-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shameer, Khader; Sowdhamini, Ramanathan","journal":"J Clin Bioinforma","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ed134293562340d043a5e0b6f5d822df7cf7079.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3508620.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2043-9113-2-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22472218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene Ontology"],"organizations":["KEGG","KEGG BRITE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D domain swapping","Protein domain enrichment analysis","functional disease ontology","disease implications of proteins","Pathway enrichment analysis","functional classes","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","Parkinson\u0027s disease","disease correlations","vascular disease","classes of human diseases","major classes of disease","term enrichment analysis","functional repertoire of proteins","Pathway analysis","various disease categories","various diseases","swapped proteins","different enrichment tools","conformational diseases","KEGG annotations","degenerative diseases","understanding of functional","prion diseases","diverse pathway associations of human proteins","meta-analysis results","protein dimer","classes of KEGG BRITE hierarchy","enriched KEGG pathways","annotations database","Gene Ontology","different ontologies","swapped conformations","human proteome","significant associations","diverse set of protein structures","key mediator of numerous functional mechanisms","structural segments","new insights","study","literature-curated dataset of human gene products","novel structural phenomenon","distinct structural feature","pulmonary system","oligomeric conformations","central nervous system","integrated bioinformatics pipeline","amyloidosis","pathogenic role","clinical relevant information","analytical approaches","encephalitis","cancer","P-value","conserved domains","terms","focus","higher oligomer","CONCLUSIONS","panel","BACKGROUND","chains","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Both infectious diseases and preventive behavior diffuse simultaneously through human networks and interact with one another, but few existing models have coupled them together. This article proposes a conceptual framework to fill this knowledge gap and illustrates the model establishment. The conceptual model consists of two networks and two diffusion processes. The two networks include: an infection network that transmits diseases and a communication network that channels inter-personal influence regarding preventive behavior. Both networks are composed of same individuals but different types of interactions. This article further introduces modeling approaches to formulize such a framework, including the individual-based modeling approach, network theory, disease transmission models and behavioral models. An illustrative model was implemented to simulate a coupled-diffusion process during an influenza epidemic. The simulation outcomes suggest that the transmission probability of a disease and the structure of infection network have profound effects on the dynamics of coupled-diffusion. The results imply that current models may underestimate disease transmissibility parameters, because human preventive behavior has not been considered. This issue calls for a new interdisciplinary study that incorporates theories from epidemiology, social science, behavioral science, and health psychology.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Liang; Yang, Yan","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53452a9572ffc6335559670542e53cefc5bfeca0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126515.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22154610/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953611006551; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953611006551; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.10.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease transmission models","human preventive behavior","human networks","practice of preventive behavior","behavioral models","individuals","transmission of infectious diseases","network theory","communication network","Abstract Human-disease interactions","current models","existing models","conceptual model","structure of infection network","coupled-diffusion process","disease transmissibility parameters","behavioral science","transmission probability","conceptual framework","model establishment","diffusion processes","illustrative model","article","social science","modeling approaches","different types of interactions","individual-based modeling approach","epidemiology","theories","inter-personal influence","profound effects","knowledge gap","new interdisciplinary study","dynamics","influenza epidemic","health psychology","issue","simulation outcomes","results"],"language":"en"},

They were commonly monomeric proteins of about 28 kDa with a range of averaged molecular weights from 27,834 to 27,868 Da among the isolectins and shared almost the same 20 N-terminal amino acid sequences. Complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning based on the rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE) methods elucidated the full-length sequence of EDA-2 which encodes 269 amino acids, including initiating methionine, with four tandemly repeated domains of about 67 amino acids. The primary structure of EDA-2 is highly similar to those of the high-mannose N-glycan specific lectins including Oscillatoria agardhii (OAA) and Burkholderia oklahomensis EO147 (BOA) from cyanobacteria, Myxococcus xanthus (MBHA) and Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (PFL) from bacteria, and ESA-2 from a macro red alga. The hemagglutination activities were commonly inhibited by the glycoproteins bearing high-mannose N-glycans, but not by monosaccharides examined, including mannose. In a direct binding experiment with pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, an isolectin EDA-2 exclusively bound to high-mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans that include complex types and a core pentasaccharide of N-glycans, indicating that it recognized the branched oligomannoside moiety. Its binding activity was subtly different among the oligomannoside structures examined, showing that the lectin has preference affinity for high-mannose type N-glycans with an exposed (\u03B11-3) mannose residue in the D2 arm. Interestingly, EDAs, the mixture of three isolectins inhibited the growth of shrimp pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus, although it did not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi. Growth inhibition of V. alginolyticus with EDAs was not observed in the presence of yeast mannan bearing high-mannose N-glycans, suggesting that EDAs caused the activity through binding to the target receptor(s) on the surface of V. alginolyticus. These results indicate that cultivated carrageenophyte E. denticulatum is a good source of a lectin(s) that may be useful as a carbohydrate probe and an antibacterial reagent.","publish_time":"2014-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Le Dinh; Hirayama, Makoto; Ly, Bui Minh; Hori, Kanji","journal":"J Appl Phycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fec3a0862943b980e70cc998c05d913a0ffcdf6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088313.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10811-014-0441-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214663/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["V. harveyi","V. alginolyticus"],"organizations":["Eucheuma"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mannose N-glycans","high-mannose type N-glycans","mannose residue","high-mannose N-glycan specific lectins","core pentasaccharide of N","EDAs","isolectins","N-terminal amino acid sequences","binding activity","amino acids","isolectin EDA","Growth inhibition of","Vibrio alginolyticus","cultivated Eucheuma denticulatum","direct binding experiment","full-length sequence of EDA","primary structure of EDA","growth of shrimp pathogenic bacterium","cultivated carrageenophyte","oligomannoside structures","branched oligomannoside moiety","rapid amplification cDNA ends","OAA","RACE","Oscillatoria agardhii","methods","cyanobacteria","BOA","cloning","pyridylaminated oligosaccharides","Burkholderia oklahomensis EO147","good source","preference affinity","kDa","Pseudomonas","MBHA","Myxococcus xanthus","initiating methionine","repeated domains","target receptor","complex types","ESA","carbohydrate probe","PFL","\u03B11","range of averaged molecular weights","presence of yeast mannan","antibacterial reagent","Pf0","Complementary DNA","results","D2 arm","surface of","mixture","glycoproteins","macro red alga","monomeric proteins","parahaemolyticus","harveyi","monosaccharides","hemagglutination activities"],"language":"en"},

While there are several hypotheses that could explain its origin, the possibility that the 1977 epidemic resulted from a laboratory accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the biosafety risks of gain-of-function (GOF) influenza virus research, as an argument for why this research should not be performed. There is now a moratorium in the United States on funding GOF research while the benefits and risks, including the potential for accident, are analyzed. Given the importance of this historical epidemic to ongoing policy debates, we revisit the evidence that the 1977 epidemic was not natural and examine three potential origins: a laboratory accident, a live-vaccine trial escape, or deliberate release as a biological weapon. Based on available evidence, the 1977 strain was indeed too closely matched to decades-old strains to likely be a natural occurrence. While the origin of the outbreak cannot be conclusively determined without additional evidence, there are very plausible alternatives to the laboratory accident hypothesis, diminishing the relevance of the 1977 experience to the modern GOF debate.","publish_time":"2015-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rozo, Michelle; Gronvall, Gigi Kwik","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2c536058f4f78ea00836ff72187c4c1b43e47da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4542197.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01013-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26286690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["influenza epidemic","laboratory accident hypothesis","historical epidemic","funding GOF research","influenza virus research","natural event","natural occurrence","decades-old strains","additional evidence","available evidence","modern GOF debate","sequences of decades","potential origins","biosafety risks of gain","deliberate release","function","live-vaccine trial escape","plausible alternatives","ongoing policy debates","discussions","United States","popularity","benefits","genetic sequence","experience","relevance","argument","biological weapon","moratorium","importance","outbreak","possibility","hypotheses"],"language":"en"},

Various antiviral drugs/nucleot(s)ide analogues are currently used to reduce or arrest the replication of this virus. However, many studies have reported that nucleot(s)ide analogue-resistant HBV is circulating. Cellular signaling pathways could be one of the targets against the viral replication. Several studies reported that viral proteins interacted with mitochondrial proteins and localized in the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. And a recent study showed that mitochondrial turnover induced by thyroid hormones protected hepatocytes from hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by HBV. Strong downregulation of numerous cellular signaling pathways has also been reported to be accompanied by profound mitochondrial alteration, as confirmed by transcriptome profiling of HBV-specific CD8 T cells from chronic and acute HBV patients. In this review, we summarize the ongoing research into mitochondrial proteins and/or signaling involved with HBV proteins, which will continue to provide insight into the relationship between mitochondria and HBV and ultimately lead to advances in viral pathobiology and mitochondria-targeted antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hossain, Md.

The SARS-CoV viral genome encodes several proteins which have no homology to proteins in any other coronaviruses, and a number of these proteins have been implicated in viral cytopathies. One such protein is 3a, which is also known as X1, ORF3 and U274. 3a expression is detected in both SARS-CoV infected cultured cells and patients. Among the different functions identified, 3a is a capable of inducing apoptosis. We previously showed that caspase pathways are involved in 3a-induced apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to find out protein domains on 3a that are essential for its pro-apoptotic function. Protein sequence analysis reveals that 3a possesses three major protein signatures, the cysteine-rich, Yxx\u03D5 and diacidic domains. We showed that 3a proteins carrying respective mutations in these protein domains exhibit reduced pro-apoptotic activities, indicating the importance of these domains on 3a\u0027s pro-apoptotic function. It was previously reported that 3a possesses potassium ion channel activity. We further demonstrated that the blockade of 3a\u0027s potassium channel activity abolished caspase-dependent apoptosis. This report provides the first evidence that ion channel activity of 3a is required for its pro-apoptotic function. As ion channel activity has been reported to regulate apoptosis in different pathologic conditions, finding ways to modulate the ion channel activity may offer a new direction toward the inhibition of apoptosis triggered by SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Chak-Ming; Tsoi, Ho; Chan, Wing-Man; Zhai, Shenyu; Wong, Ching-On; Yao, Xiaoqiang; Chan, Wood-Yee; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing; Chan, Ho Yin Edwin","journal":"The International Journal of Biochemistry \u0026 Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5da4409846914c9f727c149d1fc3b015513abb99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108357.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272509001538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19398035/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2009.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272509001538","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potassium ion channel activity","proteins","s potassium channel activity","protein domains exhibit","s pro-apoptotic function","pro-apoptotic activities","inhibition of apoptosis","induced apoptosis","SARS-CoV viral genome","caspase-dependent apoptosis","diacidic domains","major protein signatures","capable of inducing apoptosis","Protein sequence analysis","SARS-CoV infected cultured cells","caspase pathways","viral cytopathies","different functions","different pathologic conditions","cysteine-rich","new direction","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","respective mutations","Yxx\u03D5","patients","importance","evidence","coronaviruses","outbreak of atypical pneumonia","homology","X1","ORF3","U274","number","report","blockade","expression","study"],"language":"en"},

We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5, and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P = 0.0174), supporting that DPP4 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular factors in determining viral replication.

Of course, the public health authorities in Japan have started to prepare control measures for such events. We report here our attempts, using a mathematical model, to estimate outbreak size and to examine the most effective measures; comparing ring vaccination (contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination among contacts) and mass vaccination of the susceptible population in the area. The basic framework of the mathematical model follows a model used in previous research. The initial susceptible population is assumed to be 30 million persons. Concerning the important parameters, such as the number of initial-exposure cases, R 0 (infectious power, or natural history) and, the starting day of intervention after the initial exposure, we checked the robustness of our conclusions by sensitivity analysis. We found that mass vaccination is preferable to ring vaccination when the values for the initial-exposure cases and R 0 are high and when the start of intervention by public health authorities is delayed. In the base-case situation, the mass vaccination strategy needs almost 30 million vaccine doses. On the other hand, though ring vaccination needs fewer doses, it needs fewer than 50\u00E2\u20AC\u2030000 doses in the worst-case scenario, that with larger first exposure, higher R 0, or later start of public health authority intervention. This mathematical model can measure the prevalence of an infectious disease and can evaluate control measures for it before an outbreak. Especially, it is useful for the planning of the outbreaks of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or for bioterrorism attacks involving such diseases as smallpox. In further research, we will have to take into account the population people vaccinated of for smallpox, who account for about 70% of the total population in Japan.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohkusa, Yasushi; Taniguchi, Kiyosu; Okubo, Ichiro","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/625ebf6fb0e903bee91ebbbf16a9223e3cad7eca.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9ad605f2d239100d0457719e28472d021368cf98.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X05710072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X05710072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Japan"],"keyphrases":["ring vaccination","initial exposure","mass vaccination strategy","initial-exposure cases","mathematical model","initial susceptible population","anthrax exposure events","public health authorities","bioterrorism attacks","number of initial","control measures","public health authority intervention","fewer doses","start of intervention","population people","total population","effective measures","higher R","terrorist attacks","Japan","vaccine doses","smallpox","account","starting day of intervention","infectious power","infectious disease","outbreak size","previous research","outbreaks of emerging diseases","severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","isolation","values","contact tracing","robustness","natural history","United States","base-case situation","planning","prevalence","contacts","worst-case scenario","conclusions","sensitivity analysis","basic framework","hand","real threat","important parameters","Abstract","area","attempts","persons"],"language":"en"},

Neonatal calves were challenged with C. parvum oocysts and concomitantly treated with antibody-biocide fusion 4H9-G1-LL37 over the course of four days. This resulted in reduced severity of the disease when compared to control animals. Overall clinical health parameters showed significant improvement in treated animals. Oocyst shedding was reduced in treated when compared to control animals. Control of oocyst shedding is a prerequisite for breaking the cycle of re-infection on dairy farms.

A variety of infectious agents are implicated in calf diarrhea and co-infection of multiple pathogens is not uncommon in diarrheic calves. A case\u2013control study was conducted to assess infectious etiologies associated with calf diarrhea in Midwest cattle farms. A total of 199 and 245 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively, from 165 cattle farms. Samples were tested by a panel of multiplex PCR assays for 11 enteric pathogens: bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine torovirus (BToV) Salmonella spp. (Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99\u002B, Clostridium perfringens with \u03B2 toxin gene and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum). The association between diarrhea and detection of each pathogen was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model.

Statistically, BRV-A, BCoV, BNoV, Nebovirus, Salmonella, E. coli K99\u002B, and C. parvum were significantly associated with calf diarrhea (p \u003C0.05). Among them, C. parvum and BRV-A were considered to be the most common enteric pathogens for calf diarrhea with high detection frequency (33.7% and 27.1%) and strong odds ratio (173 and 79.9).

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Letko, Michael; Munster, Vincent","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7034a6c6a996992c8811065bdd0a2326c2399da2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9daed5e675ac113d1939056dcebbb1f32ec0d7ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.22.915660","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different lineage B viruses","lineage B betacoronaviruses","human cells","species barrier","novel viruses","significant barrier","viral entry","human ACE2","ability","humans","receptor usage","different species","SARS- CoV","SARS-CoV","unknown receptor","nCoV","zoonotic viral outbreak","thousands of coronavirus sequences","diverse animals","global viromics projects","animal markets","geographic regions","outbreaks of severe","cell types","host protease processing","hampered efforts","approach","respiratory illness","tools available","years"],"language":"en"},

These self-binding sequences represent opportunities for the development of biochemical tools and/or therapeutics. Here, we report on the identification of a putative self-binding \u03B2-zipper-forming peptide within the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike (S) protein and its application in viral detection. Peptide array scanning of overlapping peptides covering the entire length of S protein identified 34 putative self-binding peptides of six clusters, five of which contained octapeptide core consensus sequences. The Cluster I consensus octapeptide sequence GINITNFR was predicted by the Eisenberg\u2019s 3D profile method to have high amyloid-like fibrillation potential through steric \u03B2-zipper formation. Peptide C6 containing the Cluster I consensus sequence was shown to oligomerize and form amyloid-like fibrils. Taking advantage of this, C6 was further applied to detect the S protein expression in vitro by fluorescence staining. Meanwhile, the coiled-coil-forming Leu/Ile heptad repeat sequences within the S protein were under-represented during peptide array scanning, in agreement with that long peptide lengths were required to attain high helix-mediated interaction avidity. The data suggest that short \u03B2-zipper-like self-binding peptides within the S protein could be identified through combining the peptide scanning and predictive methods, and could be exploited as biochemical detection reagents for viral infection.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Si Min; Liao, Ying; Neo, Tuan Ling; Lu, Yanning; Liu, Ding Xiang; Vahlne, Anders; Tam, James P.","journal":"The International Journal of Biochemistry \u0026 Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ee76fb6145ef546146807dc8087a1d596bedc29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108413.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272518301249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800727/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272518301249; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2018.05.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eisenberg"],"organizations":["Leu/Ile"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["self-binding sequences","putative self-binding \u03B2-zipper","S protein expression","Ile zipper sequence","putative self-binding peptides","Peptide C6","Abstract Self-binding peptides","short \u03B2-zipper","entire length of S protein","steric \u03B2-zipper formation","Peptide array scanning of overlapping peptides","long peptide lengths","homophilic sequence-specific zipper motifs","high amyloid","consensus octapeptide sequence GINITNFR","octapeptide core consensus sequences","coiled-coil","Leu","form amyloid","viral detection","fibrils","cross-\u03B2 spine steric zippers","biochemical detection reagents","Ile heptad","coiled coil regions of proteins","viral infection","development of biochemical tools","high helix-mediated interaction avidity","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike","fibrillation potential","agreement","opportunities","Eisenberg\u2019s","D profile method","origin","clusters","fluorescence staining","application","identification","data","therapeutics","predictive methods","advantage"],"language":"en"},

However, traditional injected vaccines are generally poor inducers of mucosal immunity. One of the effective strategies to improve vaccine efficacy is incorporation of adjuvant molecules that enhance and polarize adaptive immune reactions. Effects of Syk-coupled lectin receptor agonists as adjuvants to induce mucosal immune reactions during parenteral immunization are not fully studied. We now report that the agonists trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB), curdlan, and furfurman, which stimulate Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle, respectively, activate transcription factors (NF-\u03BAB, NFAT, and AP-1) to various extents in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages, even though similar pathways are activated. The agonists also elicit differential expression of maturation markers in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, as well as differential cytokine secretion from these cells and from splenic mononuclear cells. In vivo assays also show that agonists of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, but not Mincle, induce heavy IgA secretion in intestinal mucosa even when delivered parenterally. Strikingly, this effect appears to be formulation-independent. Collectively, the data suggest that adjuvants based on Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 agonists may significantly improve the efficacy of parenteral vaccines by inducing robust local immune reactions in intestinal mucosa.","publish_time":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dzharullaeva, Alina S.; Tukhvatulin, Amir I.; Erokhova, Alina S.; Bandelyuk, Alina S.; Polyakov, Nikita B.; Solovyev, Andrey I.; Nikitenko, Natalia A.; Shcheblyakov, Dmitry V.; Naroditsky, Boris S.; Logunov, Denis Y.; Gintsburg, Alexander L.","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcd61a98bcf6ab96b5e65dd3f7bfe288e6f9153a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5872666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29725603/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3835720","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["agonists of Dectin","mucosal immune reactions","agonists trehalose","adaptive immune reactions","robust local immune reactions","lectin receptor agonists","long-lived mucosal immune response","efficacy of parenteral vaccines","intestinal mucosa","adjuvants","Mincle","differential cytokine secretion","splenic mononuclear cells","poor inducers of mucosal immunity","vaccine efficacy","parenteral immunization","bone marrow-derived dendritic cells","traditional injected vaccines","heavy IgA secretion","differential expression of maturation markers","macrophages","vaccination","incorporation of adjuvant molecules","various extents","NF-\u03BAB","transcription factors","TDB","NFAT","protection","dibehenate","effective strategies","Effects of Syk","curdlan","numerous pathogens","furfurman","Induction","similar pathways","formulation-independent","data","assays"],"language":"en"},

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2).

The latter is a frequent disease of dairy industry with staggering economical losses upon decreased milk production and increased health care costs. Early stage diagnosis of the associated diseases or inflammation onset is almost impossible by conventional analytical manners. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates a simple, rapid, and cost-effective label-free chemiluminescence bioassay based on magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) for sensitive detection of haptoglobin by employing the specific interaction of hemoglobin-modified MNPs. The resulting haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex inhibits the peroxidase-like activity of luminol/H(2)O(2)-hemoglobin-MNPs sensing scheme and reduces the chemiluminescence intensities correspondingly to the innate haptoglobin concentrations. Quantitative detection of bovine haptoglobin was obtained within the range of 1 pg mL(\u22121) to 1 \u00B5g mL(\u22121), while presenting 0.89 pg mL(\u22121) limit of detection. Moreover, the influence of causative pathogenic bacteria (i.e., Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Escherichia coli) and somatic cell counts (depicting healthy, sub-clinical and clinical mastitis) on the emitted chemiluminescence radiation were established. The presented bioassay quantitative performances correspond with a standardized assay kit in differentiating dissimilar milk qualities. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the main advantage of the presented sensing concept is the ability to detect haptoglobin, at clinically relevant concentrations within real milk samples for early bio-diagnostic detection of mastitis and hence adjusting the precise treatment, potentially initiating a positive influence on animals\u2019 individual health and hence on dairy farms economy.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nirala, Narsingh R.; Harel, Yifat; Lellouche, Jean-Paul; Shtenberg, Giorgi","journal":"J Nanobiotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0391c13dbb9949494913c209424ed61d3a652753.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6945394.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31910856/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-019-0569-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitive detection of haptoglobin","Quantitative detection of bovine haptoglobin","innate haptoglobin concentrations","resulting haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex","clinical mastitis","bovine mastitis","limit of detection","early bio-diagnostic detection of mastitis","hemoglobin-MNPs sensing scheme","chemiluminescence intensities","modified MNPs","pg","presented bioassay quantitative performances","decreased milk production","real milk samples","dissimilar milk qualities","presented sensing concept","emitted chemiluminescence radiation","specific interaction of hemoglobin","cost-effective label-free chemiluminescence bioassay","positive influence","diagnostic biomarker","relevant concentrations","animals\u2019 individual health","Early stage diagnosis","dairy farms economy","increased health care costs","frequent disease of dairy industry","influence of causative pathogenic bacteria","staggering economical losses","standardized assay kit","associated diseases","somatic cell counts","magnetite nanoparticles","Streptococcus dysgalactiae","inflammation onset","Escherichia coli","ovarian cancer","main advantage","peroxidase","acute-phase protein","cardiovascular disorders","present study","activity of luminol","diabetes","conventional analytical manners","humans","ability","precise treatment","range","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","\u00B5g"],"language":"en"},

Our previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein elicits highly potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals. But it is unknown whether RBD can also induce protective immunity in an animal model, a key aspect for vaccine development. In this study, BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10\u03BCg of RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) and boosted twice at 3-week intervals and one more time at 12th month. Humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1-month interval and the neutralizing titers of produced antibodies were reported at months 0, 3, 6 and 12 post-vaccination. Mice were challenged with the homologous strain of SARS-CoV 5 days after the last boost, and sacrificed 5 days after the challenge. Mouse lung tissues were collected for detection of viral load, virus replication and histopathological effects. Our results showed that RBD-Fc vaccination induced high titer of S-specific antibodies with long-term and potent SARS-CoV neutralizing activity. Four of five vaccinated mice were protected from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge because no significant virus replication, and no obvious histopathological changes were found in the lung tissues of the vaccinated mice challenged with SARS-CoV. Only one vaccinated mouse had mild alveolar damage in the lung tissues. In contrast, high copies of SARS-CoV RNA and virus replication were detected, and pathological changes were observed in the lung tissues of the control mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RBD, which can induce protective antibodies to SARS-CoV, may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine.","publish_time":"2007-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; He, Yuxian; Guo, Yan; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b72cf69eb0577766ee2a34c2e2417fa9d857dcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115660.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06011534; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06011534","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potent SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV spike","subsequent SARS-CoV challenge","high copies of SARS","CoV RNA","homologous strain of SARS","effective SARS subunit vaccine","RBD-Fc vaccination","\u03BCg of RBD","c mice","control mice","vaccinated mouse","Mouse lung tissues","Humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice","protective antibodies","significant virus replication","specific antibodies","potent neutralizing antibody responses","neutralizing titers of produced antibodies","vaccine development","days","months","high titer of S","obvious histopathological changes","human IgG1 Fc","Abstract Development of effective vaccines","histopathological effects","protective immunity","month interval","post-vaccination","severe acute respiratory syndrome","protein","detection of viral load","mild alveolar damage","coronavirus","animal model","key aspect","immunized animals","receptor-binding domain","priority","time","study","BALB","prevention of re-emergence","contrast","boost","results","activity","week intervals","previous studies","conclusion","findings"],"language":"en"},

The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC(50)) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC(50). The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.","publish_time":"2018-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agostini, Maria L.; Andres, Erica L.; Sims, Amy C.; Graham, Rachel L.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Lu, Xiaotao; Smith, Everett Clinton; Case, James Brett; Feng, Joy Y.; Jordan, Robert; Ray, Adrian S.; Cihlar, Tomas; Siegel, Dustin; Mackman, Richard L.; Clarke, Michael O.; Baric, Ralph S.; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39f33cf580fe6ce842e2c9005570d08115c3ed4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5844999.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00221-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","WT MHV","MHV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["development of GS","absence of GS","action of GS","nucleoside analogue GS","nontoxic concentrations of GS","MHV resistance mutations","MERS-CoV","emerging CoVs","attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis","Passage of WT MHV","resistance phenotype","zoonotic CoVs","fold resistance","proofreading activity","CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease","MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading","nsp12 polymerase","mouse model","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","setting of intact ExoN","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Emerging coronaviruses","parent nucleoside","cause severe disease","direct coinfection passage","complicated development of antiviral nucleosides","humans","remdesivir","presence","murine hepatitis virus","effective concentration values","residues","wild-type","approved therapeutics","Introduction","resistant viruses","studies","results"],"language":"en"},

These enzymes may also be found in serum as a consequence of non-haematopoietic related diseases and so have been used as indicators of liver damage. Haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow go through a process of growth and differentiation before being released into the peripheral circulation where they fulfill many functional roles. The enzyme activities of some aminopeptidases have been shown to modulate the growth of these cells. In addition, the activities of these enzymes themselves can be regulated by haematopoietic growth factors. However, the mechanisms that regulate their expression and activity are not fully understood. In this report the current literature has been reviewed for evidence of expression, regulation and clinical significance.","publish_time":"1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razak, K; Newland, A.

Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like \u211B = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of \u201Ctest-and-treat\u201D interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dushoff, Jonathan; Park, Sang Woo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d2947d5c0addcbbcfa71d87ea074a8b6ff2a973.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a70e958bf6c8c75e6e9155097c9d82d7b7dfa472.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.974048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strength-based paradigm","strength scale","corresponding speed-based paradigm","Disease modelers","disease spread","exponential growth rate r","reproductive number \u211B","epidemic","clearest insight","clearest view","proportion of HIV","intervention strategy","complementary insights","complementary measures","certain questions","expense","classic","uncertainty","interventions","human immunodeficiency virus","mathematical framework","threshold","effectiveness","test","cases","emphasis","course of infection","prospects","example"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia or with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia were included. Data including lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: : 56 patients were included in the study, 40 children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and 16 children with RSV pneumonia. Compared with children with RSV pneumonia, patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia had higher count of CD3\u002B8\u002B lymphocyte, higher percentages of CD3\u002B, CD3\u002B8\u002B lymphocytes and a lower percentage of CD19\u002B lymphocyte. The serum IL-10 level was significantly higher in children with RSV pneumonia. One 2019-nCoV pneumonia child who was with an obvious increase of IL-10 developed severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Immune response played a very important role in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The effective CD8\u002B T cell response might influence the severity of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The adaptable change in IL-10 level might contribute to the relatively mild pneumonia symptoms in children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and bacterial co-infection might be a risk factor of severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hui; Chen, Kailan; Liu, Maochang; Xu, Hua; Xu, Qiong","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9331ffe162d2c516b1ec158b8352bacc3511276a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169899.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325129/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302073?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302073; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV pneumonia","nCoV pneumonia child","children","developed severe pneumonia","mild pneumonia symptoms","serum IL","serum cytokines","higher count of CD3","higher percentages of CD3","level","patients","study","characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets","obvious increase of IL","Immune response","risk factor of severe","T cell response","respiratory syncytial virus","bacterial co-infection","severity","novel coronavirus","important role","effective CD8","lymphocytes","lower percentage of CD19","Data","development","adaptable change","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, viral proteases are attractive targets for anti-viral therapy. Most assays available for testing proteolytical activity of proteases are performed in vitro, using heterologously expressed proteases and peptide substrates. To deal with the disadvantages associated with in vitro assays, we modified a cell-based protease assay for picornavirus proteases. The assay is based on the induction of expression of a firefly luciferase reporter by a chimeric transcription factor in which the viral protease and cleavage sites are inserted between the GAL4 binding domain and the VP16 activation domain. Firefly luciferase expression is dependent on cleavage of the transcription factor by the viral protease. This biosafe assay enables testing the effect of compounds on protease activity in cells while circumventing the need for infection. We designed the assay for 3C proteases (3Cpro) of various enteroviruses as well as of viruses of several other picornavirus genera, and show that the assay is amenable for use in a high-throughput setting. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of activity of 3Cpro inhibitor AG7088 (rupintrivir) not only encompasses enterovirus 3Cpro but also 3Cpro of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), an aphthovirus. In contrary, AG7404 (compound 1), an analogue of AG7088, had no effect on FMDV 3Cpro activity, for which we provide a structural explanation.","publish_time":"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Linden, Lonneke; Ulferts, Rachel; Nabuurs, Sander B.; Kusov, Yuri; Liu, Hong; George, Shyla; Lacroix, C\u00E9line; Goris, Nesya; Lefebvre, David; Lanke, Kjerstin H.W.; De Clercq, Kris; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Neyts, Johan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113757.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354213003811; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354213003811; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteases","Cpro activity","protease activity","picornavirus proteases","testing proteolytical activity of proteases","viral replication","C proteases","Cpro of foot","cell-based protease assay","biosafe assay","Cpro inhibitor AG7088","spectrum of activity","anti-viral therapy","heterologously expressed proteases","cleavage sites","Firefly luciferase expression","Abstract Proteolytical cleavage","FMDV","chimeric transcription factor","firefly luciferase reporter","effect of compounds","induction of expression","assays available","analogue of AG7088","picornavirus genera","GAL4 binding domain","VP16 activation domain","picornaviral polyprotein","attractive targets","cells","mouth disease virus","peptide substrates","rupintrivir","various enteroviruses","high-throughput setting","need","AG7404","infection","aphthovirus","structural explanation","disadvantages"],"language":"en"},

As such, there are numerous players involved to ensure that the proteins are properly localized. Overall, transport requires vesicle budding, recognition of the vesicle by the target membrane and fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane resulting in delivery of its contents. The initial interaction between the vesicle and the target membrane has been referred to as tethering. Because this is the first contact between the two membranes, tethering is critical to ensuring that specificity is achieved. It is therefore not surprising that there are numerous \u2018tethering factors\u2019 involved ranging from multisubunit complexes, coiled-coil proteins and Rab guanosine triphosphatases. Of the multisubunit tethering complexes, one of the best studied at the molecular level is the evolutionarily conserved TRAPP complex. There are two forms of this complex: TRAPP I and TRAPP II. In yeast, these complexes function in a number of processes including endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport (TRAPP I) and an ill-defined step at the trans Golgi (TRAPP II). Because the complex was first reported in 1998 (1), there has been a decade of studies that have clarified some aspects of its function but have also raised further questions. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of yeast and mammalian TRAPP at the structural and functional levels and its role in disease while trying to resolve some apparent discrepancies and highlighting areas for future study.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sacher, Michael; Kim, Yeon-Gil; Lavie, Arnon; Oh, Byung-Ha; Segev, Nava","journal":"Traffic","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a9c72c0016381234cd172d2057730ef2b4d723e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/32337037a99e107f0524861b006080b4f9e9ee28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3417770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18801063/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00833.x; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3417770?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rab"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mammalian TRAPP","conserved TRAPP complex","vesicle budding","Vesicle-mediated transport","target membrane","multisubunit tethering complexes","Golgi transport","multisubunit complexes","tethering factors\u2019","coil proteins","secretion of proteins","understanding of yeast","trans Golgi","numerous players","functional levels","highlighting areas","apparent discrepancies","endoplasmic reticulum","recognition","fusion","future study","molecular level","ill-defined step","disease","role","recent advances","Rab guanosine triphosphatases","number of processes","best","proper targeting","membranes","delivery","initial interaction","review","cell","aspects","contents","contact","specificity","forms","decade of studies","questions"],"language":"en"},

The host immunity involves various mechanisms to combat viral infections. Under certain circumstances, a viral infection or vaccination may result in a subverted immune system, which may lead to an exacerbated illness. Clinical evidence of enhanced illness by preexisting antibodies from vaccination, infection or maternal passive immunity is available for several viruses and is presumptively proposed for other viruses. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. It has been confirmed that certain infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity could exacerbate viral infectivity in Fc receptor- or complement bearing cells- mediated mechanisms. Considering that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is a major obstacle in vaccine development, there are continues efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms through identification of the epitopes and antibodies responsible for disease enhancement or protection.

The complete genome sequences of around 450 isolates are available, and studies about similarities and differences among them and with the close related viruses that caused similar epidemics in this century. In this work we studied the complete genome of the first four cases of the new coronavirus disease in Chile, from patients who traveled to Europe and Southeast Asia. Our findings reveal at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory, coming from Europe and Asia.

Thirty-three (39%) of the 84 mAbs were found to be strain-specific, and 6 (7%) of the 84 mAbs were subtype-specific. Twenty (24%) of the 84 mAbs recognized the common HA epitopes shared by 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1), and A3 (H3N2) influenza viruses. Twenty-five of the 84 clones recognized the common HA epitopes shared by the 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1) and A3 (H3N2) human influenza viruses, and H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses. We found that of the 16 (19%) clones of the 84 mAbs panel that were cross-reactive with human respiratory pathogens, 15 were made using the HA of the seasonal A1 (H1N1) virus and 1 was made using the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarray (TMA) showed that 4 of the 84 mAb clones cross-reacted with human tissue (brain and pancreas).

Unlike in human viral diseases, where some miRNA-based molecules have progressed to clinical application, in veterinary medicine, this concept is just starting to come into view. Clinically, miRNAs could represent powerful diagnostic tools to pinpoint animal viral diseases and/or prognostic tools to follow up disease progression or remission. Additionally, the possible consequences of miRNA dysregulation make them potential therapeutic targets and open the possibilities to use them as tools to generate viral disease-resistant livestock. This review presents an update of preclinical studies on using sncRNAs to combat viral diseases that affect pet and farm animals.

Although most respiratory pathogens, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rarely cause severe disease in healthy human adults, they are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in wild great apes habituated to humans for research or tourism. To prevent pathogen transmission, most great ape projects have established a set of hygiene measures ranging from keeping a specific distance, to the use of surgical masks and establishment of quarantines. This study investigates the incidence of respiratory symptoms and human respiratory viruses in humans at a human\u2010great ape interface, the Ta\u00EF Chimpanzee Project (TCP) in C\u00F4te d\u0027Ivoire, and consequently, the effectiveness of a 5\u2010day quarantine designed to reduce the risk of potential exposure to human respiratory pathogens. To assess the impact of quarantine as a preventative measure, we monitored the quarantine process and tested 262 throat swabs for respiratory viruses, collected during quarantine over a period of 1 year. Although only 1 subject tested positive for a respiratory virus (HRSV), 17 subjects developed symptoms of infection while in quarantine and were subsequently kept from approaching the chimpanzees, preventing potential exposure in 18 cases. Our results suggest that quarantine\u2014in combination with monitoring for symptoms\u2014is effective in reducing the risk of potential pathogen exposure.

This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 cancer-free controls.

When we used an improved gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that the Fas signaling pathway and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant (nominal P \u003C 0.001; false discovery rate \u003C 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17 572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the gene\u2013asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.

EV71 epidemics have been reported in Hong Kong in recent years, and yet the genetic information of EV71 strains circulating in our locality is limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic evolution of these EV71 isolates in Hong Kong over a 7-year period. METHODS: Twenty-two EV71 isolates from Hong Kong during 2004\u20132010 were included for phylogenetic analysis using partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D regions. Eight EV71 strains were selected for complete genome sequencing and recombination analysis. RESULTS: Among the 22 EV71 isolates, 20 belonged to subgenotype C4 and 2 belonged to subgenotype C2 based on the phylogenetic analysis of partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D gene regions. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analyses using complete genome sequences of seven EV71 isolates of subgenotype C4 supported that the \u201Cdouble-recombinant\u201D strains of subgenotype C4 persistently circulating in Hong Kong should belong to a newly proposed genotype D. Further analysis revealed two clusters, subgenotypes C4b and C4a (proposed genotypes D1a and D1b respectively), with \u201Cgenotype D1b\u201D strains being predominant in recent years in Hong Kong. A distinct lineage of EV71 subgenotype C2 has emerged in Hong Kong in 2008. The evolutionary rate of EV71 was 3.1 \u00D7 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site per year similar to that of other enterovirus, such as EV68, but was relatively lower than those of echovirus 30 and poliovirus. Molecular clock analysis using VP1 gene dated the time to the most recent common ancestor of all EV71 genotypes to 1900s, while the EV71 \u201Cdouble-recombinant\u201D strains of \u201Cgenotype D\u201D were detected as early as 1998. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the molecular basis for proposing a new \u201Cgenotype D\u201D of EV71 and assigning a discrete lineage of subgenotype C2. EV71 strains of \u201Cgenotype D\u201D have been circulating in Hong Kong for over 7 years, with \u201Cgenotype D1b\u201D being predominant.","publish_time":"2013-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yip, Cyril CY; Lau, Susanna KP; Lo, Janice YC; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Woo, Patrick CY; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40540b92cbf5d985e0648733de6f4a9062e1bbcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3716818.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23822185/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["EV71 genotypes","EV71 epidemics","Hong Kong","EV71 isolates of subgenotype C4","genetic information of EV71 strains","evolutionary rate of EV71","distinct lineage of EV71 subgenotype C2","strains of subgenotype C4","genotype D1b","D regions","recombination analysis","recent years","discrete lineage of subgenotype C2","D gene regions","phylogenetic analysis of partial VP2-VP3","Molecular clock analysis","recent common ancestor","double-recombinant","study","Enterovirus","complete genome sequences","complete genome sequencing","proposed genotypes D1a","genetic evolution","year similar","VP1 gene","molecular basis","year period","common etiological agent of hand","foot","C4a","bootscan analyses","subgenotypes C4b","time","mouth disease","similarity plot","clusters","HFMD","nucleotide substitutions","site","children","METHODS","echovirus","EV68","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","locality","poliovirus","objective"],"language":"en"},

Current COVID-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to COVID-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In view of uncertainty associated with immunosuppressive treatments such as corticosteroids and their possible secondary effects, including risks of secondary infections, we suggest immunotherapies as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 cases. Such immunotherapies based on inflammatory cytokine neutralization, immunomodulation and passive viral neutralization, not only reduce inflammation, inflammation-associated lung damage, or viral load, but could also prevent intensive care unit hospitalization and dependency on mechanical ventilation both of which are limited resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonam, Srinivasa Reddy; Kaveri, Srini V.; Sakuntabhai, Anavaj; Gilardin, Laurent; Bayry, Jagadeesh","journal":"Cell Reports Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6ad8c9b0086b05f7436e6eed4831c0b722c50ef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666379120300215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379120300215?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","specific COVID","Current COVID","severe lung damage","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","inflammation-associated lung damage","mechanical ventilation","immunotherapies","inflammatory cytokine neutralization","passive viral neutralization","development of acute respiratory distress syndrome","cytokine storm","viral load","fatal cases","possible secondary effects","immune cell migration","risks of secondary infections","early immune response","Abstract Coronavirus disease","dependency","lungs","immunomodulation","intensive care unit hospitalization","corticosteroids","immunosuppressive treatments","adjunct therapy","data","SARS-CoV","view of uncertainty","infected millions","limited resources","patients"],"language":"en"},

The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2-hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery pefiod, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of O3 causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury.","publish_time":"1992-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Ling-Yi; Huang, Ying; Stockstill, Barbara L.; Graham, Judith A.; Grose, Elaine C.; Menache, Margaret G.; Miller, Frederick J.; Costa, Daniel L.; Crapo, James D.","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08ff79f4327d66b3dd0c59694fec7dd0de70df61.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0041008X9290329Q; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0041008X9290329Q","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Clara"],"organizations":["Abstract Electron"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weeks of exposure","chronic exposure","epithelial cells","short-term exposure","week of exposure","prolonged exposure","continued exposure","exposure peak","entire exposure","epithelial responses","epithelial inflammation","daily exposure regimen","epithelial hyperplasia","bronchiolar epithelial cell injury","Clara cells","interstitial matrix accumulation","accumulation of interstitial matrix","interstitial fibrosis","interstitial edema","interstitial cell hypertrophy","interstitial tissue responses","Alveolar type","loss of ciliated cells","cell proliferation","proximal alveolar regions","hr background","bronchiolar cell population","main response of type","Analysis of terminal bronchioles","hr period","hr downtime","development of lung injury","filtered clean air","ppm","increased amounts of basement membrane","low levels of O3","Additional groups of rats","fibroblast proliferation","partial recovery","biphasic response","recovery pefiod","structural changes","background level","Acute tissue reactions","deposition","follow-up periods","differentiation of preciliated","collagen fibers","high urban ambient concentrations","Samples","sensitivity","smaller average surface area","influx of macrophages","Abstract Electron microcopic morphometry","pattern of ozone","lengths of time","thickening","number","controls","environments","maintenance","microdissection"],"language":"en"},

Currently, several clinical trials are underway to identify specific drugs for the treatment of this novel virus. The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is necessary for the blockage of the viral replication. Here, in this study, we have utilized a blind molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, by screening a total of 33 molecules which includes natural products, anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-nematodes and anti-protozoals. All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug). All the molecules, studied out here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease, and the molecules were surrounded by other active site residues like MET49, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189. As this study is based on molecular docking, hence being particular about the results obtained, requires extensive wet-lab experimentation and clinical trials under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Sourav; Sarmah, Sharat; Lyndem, Sona; Singha Roy, Atanu","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362245/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1763201","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","studied molecules","anti-viral drug","anti-fungals","anti-virals","anti-nematodes","anti-protozoals","main protease","natural compound","control drug","natural products","active site residues","clinical trials","study","blind molecular docking approach","novel virus","viral replication","novel infectious disease","crucial catalytic residues","GLY143","HIS163","millions of people","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","MET49","HIS41","CYS145","emetine","indinavir","possible inhibitors","extensive wet-lab experimentation","GLU166","HIS164","specific drugs","blockage","hesperidin","lopinavir","highest inhibitor efficiency","PRO168","treatment","new strain","ritonavir","total","pandemic","World Health Organization","results","6Y84","rutin","PDB","GLN189","inhibition","conditions"],"language":"en"},

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is an important target in developing safe and effective SARS vaccines. Our previous study has demonstrated that vaccination with adeno-associated virus encoding RBD (RBD-rAAV) induces high titer of neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-specific T cell peptide boost, as compared to those of vaccinations with RBD-rAAV and RBD-peptides alone. Our results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost induced similar Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses, but stronger Th2 and CTL responses than RBD-rAAV prime/boost. The resulting immune responses protected the vaccinated mice from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge, which was evidenced by lower level of viral replication in mouse lung tissues. However, no significant immune responses and protective effect were detected in mice vaccinated with RBD-peptides or blank AAV alone. Since T cell epitopes are highly conserved and boosting with peptides may induce the production of effector memory T cells, our results suggest that the vaccination protocol used may be ideal for providing effective, universal and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Lin, Yongping; Chan, Chris CS; He, Yuxian; Jiang, Shibo; Wu, Changyou; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zhou, Yusen; Zheng, Bo-Jian","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ddcba8a21dabd170334389aabae8b87e0f62ab0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6a017719e92f20761baf333ad6a87378eab4dd6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2600875.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.01.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18289745/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08000716; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08000716","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CTL","AAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBD-peptides","RBD-rAAV prime","RBD-peptide boost","SARS-CoV spike","SARS-CoV infection","RBD-specific T cell peptide boost","effective SARS vaccines","subsequent SARS-CoV challenge","CTL responses","prevention of SARS reemergence","resulting immune responses","significant immune responses","neutralizing antibody responses","protective effect","vaccinated mice","T cell epitopes","results","Development of vaccines","vaccination protocol","previous study","production of effector memory T cells","high titer of neutralizing antibodies","stronger Th2","similar Th1","severe acute respiratory syndrome","long-term protection","coronavirus","lower level of viral replication","immunization","important target","adeno-associated virus","mouse lung tissues","protein","receptor-binding domain","blank AAV","vaccinations"],"language":"en"},

Here we report the crystal structure of ORF-9b, an alternative open reading frame within the nucleocapsid (N) gene from the SARS coronavirus. The protein has a novel fold, a dimeric tent-like \u03B2 structure with an amphipathic surface, and a central hydrophobic cavity that binds lipid molecules. This cavity is likely to be involved in membrane attachment and, in mammalian cells, ORF-9b associates with intracellular vesicles, consistent with a role in the assembly of the virion.

(2) The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new corona virus isolated for the first time in a patients who died of severe lower respiratory tract infection in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) in June 2012 (Zaki et al. 2012). The disease has been named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and it has remained on the radar of global public health authorities because of recurrent nosocomial and community outbreaks, and its association with severe disease and high mortality rates (Assiri et al. 2013a; Al-Abdallat et al. 2014; Memish et al. 2013a; Oboho et al. 2015; The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group 2013; Cotten et al. 2013a; Assiri et al. 2013b; Memish et al. 2013b; Azhar et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015; Hui et al. 2015a). Cases of MERS have been reported from all continents and have been linked with travel to the Middle East (Hui et al. 2015a; WHO 2015c). The World Health Organization (WHO) have held nine meetings of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) regarding MERS-CoV (WHO 2015c). There is wishful anticipation in the political and scientific communities that MERS-CoV like SARS-CoV will disappear with time.

The viral entry mechanism determines viral tropism and pathogenesis. The entry of African swine fever virus (ASFV) is dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated, but other pathways have been described such as macropinocytosis. During endocytosis, ASFV viral particles undergo disassembly in various compartments that the virus passes through en route to the site of replication. This disassembly relies on the acid pH of late endosomes and on microtubule cytoskeleton transport. ASFV interacts with several regulatory pathways to establish an optimal environment for replication. Examples of these pathways include small GTPases, actin-related signaling, and lipid signaling. Cellular cholesterol, the entire cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and phosphoinositides are central molecular networks required for successful infection. Here we report new data on the conformation of the viral replication site or viral factory and the remodeling of the subcellular structures. We review the virus-induced regulation of ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy as key mechanisms of cell survival and determinants of infection outcome. Finally, future challenges for the development of new preventive strategies against this virus are proposed on the basis of current knowledge about ASFV-host interactions.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alonso, Covadonga; Galindo, Inmaculada; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Angel; Cabezas, Marta; Hernaez, Bruno; Mu\u00F1oz-Moreno, Raquel","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b89ea968cf71f4e19a038e4a8442b6b5515525de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114420.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170212004686; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.12.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170212004686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23262167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASFV viral particles","viral replication site","viral factory","viral tropism","viral entry mechanism","ASFV-host interactions","site of replication","host cell","disassembly","regulatory pathways","entry of African swine fever virus","virus-induced regulation of ER stress","Cellular cholesterol","successful infection","dynamic interactions","new data","determinants of infection outcome","entire cholesterol biosynthesis pathway","key mechanisms of cell survival","development of new preventive strategies","apoptosis","phosphoinositides","autophagy","central molecular networks","acid pH of late endosomes","various compartments","remodeling","conformation","basis of current knowledge","microtubule cytoskeleton transport","actin","small GTPases","dynamin-dependent","optimal environment","pathogenesis","endocytosis","future challenges","Examples","clathrin","subcellular structures","Abstract Viruses","lipid","macropinocytosis"],"language":"en"},

Ozone is a commonly encountered oxidant air pollutant, yet its effects on influenza infections in humans are not known. The greater Mexico City area was the primary site for the spring 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, which also coincided with high levels of environmental ozone. Proteolytic cleavage of the viral membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA) is essential for influenza virus infectivity. Recent studies suggest that HA cleavage might be cell-associated and facilitated by the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), whose activities are regulated by antiproteases, such as secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). Based on these observations, we sought to determine how acute exposure to ozone may modulate cellular protease/antiprotease expression and function, and to define their roles in a viral infection. We utilized our in vitro model of differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) to determine the effects of ozone on influenza cleavage, entry, and replication. We show that ozone exposure disrupts the protease/antiprotease balance within the airway liquid. We also determined that functional forms of HAT, TMPRSS2, and SLPI are secreted from human airway epithelium, and acute exposure to ozone inversely alters their expression levels. We also show that addition of antioxidants significantly reduces virus replication through the induction of SLPI. In addition, we determined that ozone-induced cleavage of the viral HA protein is not cell-associated and that secreted endogenous proteases are sufficient to activate HA leading to a significant increase in viral replication. Our data indicate that pre-exposure to ozone disrupts the protease/antiprotease balance found in the human airway, leading to increased influenza susceptibility.","publish_time":"2012-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kesic, Matthew J.; Meyer, Megan; Bauer, Rebecca; Jaspers, Ilona","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24ed22a878649ce74463bf63090563093d002c86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3322171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22496898/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035108","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA"],"locations":["Mexico City"],"keyphrases":["ozone exposure","effects of ozone","influenza cleavage","ozone-induced cleavage","transmembrane protease","HA cleavage","cellular protease","influenza infections","acute exposure","viral replication","viral HA protein","human airway trypsin","human airway epithelium","increased influenza susceptibility","pre-exposure","high levels of environmental ozone","influenza virus infectivity","antiprotease balance","airway liquid","Proteolytic cleavage","antiprotease expression","virus replication","viral infection","secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor","transmembrane serine proteases","viral membrane protein hemagglutinin","TMPRSS2","induction of SLPI","expression levels","oxidant air pollution","secreted endogenous proteases","model of differentiated human nasal epithelial cells","encountered oxidant air pollutant","addition of antioxidants","increased respiratory morbidities","functional forms of HAT","TTSPs","primary site","NECs","spring","greater Mexico City area","antiproteases","type","significant increase","entry","H1N1 pandemic","roles","Recent studies","humans","data","activities","observations"],"language":"en"},

Upon the cooperative activity of specific Ubiquitinating enzymes, ISG15 can be conjugated to its substrates. Increasing evidence points to a role for protein ISGylation in anti-viral and anti-tumoral defense. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified ISG15 from Old World Monkeys (OWm) as a hyper-efficient protein modifier. Western blot analysis visualized more efficient conjugation of OWmISG15 relative to HuISG15 in human (Hu), monkey and mouse (Mo) cell-lines. Moreover, the substrates of OWmISG15 identified upon Tandem Affinity Purification followed by LC-MS/MS identification largely outnumbered these of HuISG15 itself. Several Ubiquitin-Conjugating enzymes were identified as novel ISGylated substrates. Introduction of a N89D mutation in HuISG15 improved its ISGylation capacity, and additional Q31K/T33A/D133N mutations yielded a HuISG15 variant with an ISGylation efficiency comparable to OWmISG15. Homology modeling and structural superposition situate N89 in the interaction interface with the Activating enzyme. Analysis of the UbE1L residues in this interface revealed a striking homology between OWmUbE1L and HuUbE1, the Activating enzyme of Ubiquitin. In line with this observation, we found efficient activation of AgmISG15, but not HuISG15 or MoISG15, by HuUbE1, thus providing a likely explanation for OWm hyperISGylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study discloses the poor conjugation competence of HuISG15 compared to OWmISG15 and maps the critical determinants for efficient conjugation. HyperISGylation may greatly assist ISGylation studies and may enhance its function as positive regulator of Interferon-related immune responses or as anti-tumoral modulator.","publish_time":"2008-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pattyn, Els; Verhee, Annick; Uyttendaele, Isabel; Piessevaux, Julie; Timmerman, Evy; Gevaert, Kris; Vandekerckhove, Jo\u00EBl; Peelman, Frank; Tavernier, Jan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4873db67f7f48325e1c63ccfa093d5077a9c9b50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2423471.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18560560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tandem Affinity Purification"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HuISG15 variant","protein ISGylation","substrates of OWmISG15","efficient conjugation of OWmISG15 relative","poor conjugation competence of HuISG15","ISGylation capacity","ISGylation studies","Activating enzyme of Ubiquitin","hyper-efficient protein modifier","anti-tumoral modulator","anti-tumoral defense","HuUbE1","ISGylation efficiency comparable","efficient activation of AgmISG15","Ubiquitin-Conjugating enzymes","OWm hyperISGylation","novel ISGylated substrates","interaction interface","LC-MS","striking homology","MS identification","Homology modeling","Western blot analysis","cooperative activity of specific Ubiquitinating enzymes","related immune responses","additional Q31K","D133N mutations","T33A","OWmUbE1L","positive regulator of Interferon","structural superposition","Tandem Affinity Purification","mouse","function","human","role","Old World Monkeys","N89D mutation","study","likely explanation","critical determinants","cell-lines","UbE1L residues","Type","observation","Introduction","MoISG15","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Interferons","CONCLUSIONS","evidence","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Although it is difficult to assess the transmission potential of a probable future pandemic, historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and statistical analyses of historical data are crucial. In particular, because many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), our review focuses on methods to maximize the utility of time-evolution data and to clarify the detailed mechanisms of the spread of influenza. First, we highlight structured epidemic models and their parameter estimation method which can quantify the detailed disease dynamics including those we cannot observe directly. Duration-structured epidemic systems are subsequently presented, offering firm understanding of the definition of the basic and effective reproduction numbers. When the initial growth phase of an epidemic is investigated, the distribution of the generation time is key statistical information to appropriately estimate the transmission potential using the intrinsic growth rate. Applications of stochastic processes are also highlighted to estimate the transmission potential using similar data. Critically important characteristics of influenza data are subsequently summarized, followed by our conclusions to suggest potential future methodological improvements.","publish_time":"2008-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"Phys Life Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/037fa0356fa70e796d34d6df6e4f5281cda1be6e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e9ee028829d97cce760072c4b9cdbeff1aa036ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105222.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064507000413; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1571064507000413; https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.3088v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission potential","historical epidemiologic data","evolution data","similar data","statistical analyses of historical data","important characteristics of influenza data","epidemic curve","future pandemic planning","probable future pandemic","structured epidemic models","potential future methodological improvements","basic reproduction number of pandemic influenza","historical records","spread of influenza","Duration-structured epidemic systems","key statistical information","key threshold quantity","detailed disease dynamics","reference quantity","generation time","detailed mechanisms","utility of time","quantitative methods","effective reproduction numbers","temporal distribution of cases","intrinsic growth rate","initial growth phase","parameter estimation method","definition","previous pandemics","deaths","conclusions","firm understanding","review","intensity of interventions","Applications of stochastic processes","article"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we analyze the impact of the lockdown enforcement on the Politecnico di Torino campus network. Right after the school shutdown on the 25 th of February, PoliTO deployed its own in-house solution for virtual teaching. Ever since, the university provides about 600 virtual classes daily, serving more than 16 000 students per day. Here, we report a picture of how the pandemic changed PoliTO\u2019s network traffic. We first focus on the usage of remote working and collaboration platforms. Given the peculiarity of PoliTO online teaching solution that is hosted in-house, we drill down on the traffic, characterizing both the audience and the network footprint. Overall, we present a snapshot of the abrupt changes seen on campus traffic due to COVID-19, and testify how the Internet has proved robust to successfully cope with challenges while maintaining the university operations.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Favale, Thomas; Soro, Francesca; Trevisan, Martino; Drago, Idilio; Mellia, Marco","journal":"Computer Networks","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1371e6a9c5260dfabe1ae025bfd7c46cf628d093.json; document_parses/pdf_json/18f7db1ea08d74613eeea5c2afe9e2e3d6ecc6b7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128620306046?v=s5; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13569v2.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107290; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1389128620306046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PoliTO"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PoliTO\u2019s network traffic","virtual teaching","campus traffic","network footprint","Torino campus network","online collaboration","e-teaching","lockdown measures","peculiarity of PoliTO online teaching solution","pandemic","in-house solution","Internet","COVID","usage of remote working","lockdown enforcement","sudden changes","collaboration platforms","abrupt changes","virtual classes","university operations","adoption of severe measures","video streaming","people\u2019s habits","gaming","Politecnico","Social distancing","major role","unprecedented stress","challenges","th","spread","impact","audience","school shutdown","picture","snapshot","students","day","infection","paper"],"language":"en"},

We show that identified compounds exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunostimulatory properties, in line with recent reports linking de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis with innate defense mechanisms against viruses. Most importantly, we establish that pyrimidine deprivation can amplify the production of both type I and type III interferons by cells stimulated with retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) ligands. Altogether, our results further expand the current panel of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors and illustrate how the production of antiviral interferons is tightly coupled to this metabolic pathway.

Moreover, these compounds limited viral replication and spread. Surprisingly, Bcl-2i also induced the premature apoptosis of cells transfected with viral RNA or plasmid DNA but not of mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that Bcl-2i sensitizes cells containing foreign RNA or DNA to apoptosis. A comparison of the toxicity, antiviral activity, and side effects of six Bcl-2i allowed us to select A-1155463 as an antiviral lead candidate.

Information was collected by Healthcare structures (HS) on paper forms and transferred to the central level by post or email. Completeness of data reporting was around 20% in 2009\u201310. From 2011, in two southern regions data were transmitted through short messages service using one telephone provider. We evaluated the system in 2014\u201315 to determine its performance before changing or expanding it. METHODS: We randomly selected 80 HS and interviewed their representatives face-to-face (42) or by telephone (38). We evaluated knowledge of surveillance activities and selected case definitions, number of SMS with erroneous or missing information among the last ten transferred SMS, proportion of weekly reports received in the last 4 weeks and of the last four health alerts notified within 48 h, as well as mobile phone network coverage. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of 80 interviewed HS representatives didn\u2019t know their terms of reference, 83% were familiar with the malaria case definition and 32% with that of dengue. Ninety percent (37/41) of visited HS had five or more errors and 47% had missing data in the last ten SMS they transferred. The average time needed for weekly IDSR data compilation was 24 min in the Southern and 47 in the South-eastern region. Of 320 expected SMS 232 (73%) were received, 136 (43%) of them in time. Out of 38 alerts detected, four were notified on time. Nine percent (7/80) of HS had no telephone network with the current provider. CONCLUSIONS: SMS transfer has improved IDSR data completeness, but timeliness and data quality remain a problem. Healthcare staff needs training on guidelines and case definitions. From 2016, data are collected and managed electronically to reduce errors and improve the system\u2019s performance.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randriamiarana, Rado; Raminosoa, Gr\u00E9goire; Vonjitsara, Nikaria; Randrianasolo, Rivo; Rasamoelina, Harena; Razafimandimby, Harimahefa; Rakotonjanabelo, Arthur Lamina; Lepec, Richard; Flachet, Lo\u00EFc; Halm, Ariane","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e8fd672db3be95e223c83ea48b923fadb9d5d4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5891931.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3081-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631631/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Information","Healthcare","IDSR"],"locations":["Madagascar","Southern"],"keyphrases":["missing data","IDSR data completeness","data quality","transferred SMS","Completeness of data reporting","southern regions data","weekly IDSR data compilation","number of SMS","SMS transfer","expected SMS","interviewed HS representatives","percent","telephone provider","telephone network","selected case definitions","missing information","errors","average time","malaria case definition","Healthcare structures","Healthcare staff","current provider","health alerts","system\u2019s performance","Integrated Disease Surveillance","knowledge of surveillance activities","proportion of weekly reports","mobile phone network coverage","short messages service","timeliness","Response","paper forms","training","guidelines","central level","strategy","terms of reference","post","email","BACKGROUND","problem","CONCLUSIONS","weeks","South-eastern region","Madagascar","RESULTS","METHODS","dengue"],"language":"en"},

A variety of viral, bacterial and parasitic organisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute diarrhoea. The primary objectives of treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea are correction of dehydration with oral replacement therapy (ORT) and maintenance of good nutritional status via food intake. With regards drug therapy antimicrobial agents are not usually recommended since the disease is generally self\u2010limiting. Racecadotril is powerful and selective enkephalinase inhibitor and has emerged as a promising drug in the antisecretory therapy of acute infectious diarrhoea in children. Conclusion: There is encouraging evidence that treatment with racecadotril can provide clinically relevant symptomatic relief by reducing the severity and duration of diarrhoeal episodes.

Human parainfluenza viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family that may evoke lower respiratory infections in infants, children and immunocompromised individuals. Among non-immune compromised adults, hPIV infection typically causes mild disease manifested as upper respiratory tract symptoms and is infrequently associated with severe croup or pneumonia.

The bacterial diversity of two bat guano samples, C1 and C2, from Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. V3-V4 hypervariable regions were amplified and then sequenced using Illumina MiSeq 250 PE system. Reads were processed using Mothur and QIIME pipelines and assigned 12,345 OTUs for C1 and 5,408 OTUs for C2. The most dominant OTUs in C1 belong to the Proteobacteria (61.7%), Actinobacteria (19.4%), Bacteroidetes (4.2%), Firmicutes (2.7%), Chloroflexi (2.5%), candidate phylum TM7 (2.3%) and Planctomycetes (1.9%) while Proteobacteria (61.7%) and Actinobacteria (34.9%) dominated C2. Large proportion of sequence reads mainly associated with unclassified bacteria indicated possible occurrence of novel bacteria in both samples. XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and C2 guano revealed significant differences in the composition of both major and trace elements. C1 guano recorded high levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples registered high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr. Community structure of the samples were compared with other published community profiling studies from Finland (SRR868695), Meghalaya, Northeast India (SRR1793374) and Maharashtra State, India (CGS). Core microbiome among samples were determined for comparison. Variations were observed among previously studied guano samples and the Cabalyorisa Cave samples were attributed to either bat sources or age of the guano.

The CP is an epithelio-endothelial convolute comprising a highly vascularized stroma with fenestrated capillaries and a continuous lining of epithelial cells joined by apical tight junctions (TJs) that are crucial in forming the B-CSF barrier. Integrity of the CP is critical for maintaining brain homeostasis and B-CSF barrier permeability. Recent experimental and clinical research has uncovered the significance of the CP in the pathophysiology of various diseases affecting the CNS. The CP is involved in penetration of various pathogens into the CNS, as well as the development of neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer\u00B4s disease) and autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis). Moreover, the CP was shown to be important for restoring brain homeostasis following stroke and trauma. In addition, new diagnostic methods and treatment of CP papilloma and carcinoma have recently been developed. This review describes and summarizes the current state of knowledge with regard to the roles of the CP and B-CSF barrier in the pathophysiology of various types of CNS diseases and sets up the foundation for further avenues of research.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sol\u00E1r, Peter; Zamani, Alemeh; Kub\u00ED\u010Dkov\u00E1, Lucie; Dubov\u00FD, Petr; Joukal, Marek","journal":"Fluids Barriers CNS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93195784987bc90b7faddbb13b34d178567c8bd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201396.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12987-020-00196-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CP","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of CP papilloma","B-CSF barrier permeability","pathophysiology of various diseases","pathophysiology of various types of CNS diseases","autoimmune diseases","clinical research","restoring brain homeostasis","penetration of various pathogens","clinical importance","avenues of research","continuous lining of epithelial cells","apical tight junctions","new diagnostic methods","vascularized stroma","fenestrated capillaries","central nervous system","Alzheimer","studied structures","stroke","regard","blood","cerebrospinal fluid","epithelio-endothelial convolute","current state of knowledge","TJs","addition","trauma","foundation","roles","significance","development of neurodegenerative","multiple sclerosis","carcinoma","choroid plexus","review","Integrity"],"language":"en"},

High levels of FBL are accompanied by modifications of the rRNA methylation pattern, impairment of translational fidelity, and an increase of internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation of key cancer genes. FBL overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis and is associated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer. Thus, p53 acts as a safeguard of protein synthesis by regulating FBL and the subsequent quality and intrinsic activity of ribosomes.","publish_time":"2013-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcel, Virginie; Ghayad, Sandra E.; Belin, St\u00E9phane; Therizols, Gabriel; Morel, Anne-Pierre; Solano-Gonz\u00E0lez, Eduardo; Vendrell, Julie A.; Hacot, Sabine; Mertani, Hichem C.; Albaret, Marie Alexandra; Bourdon, Jean-Christophe; Jordan, Lee; Thompson, Alastair; Tafer, Yasmine; Cong, Rong; Bouvet, Philippe; Saurin, Jean-Christophe; Catez, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Prats, Anne-Catherine; Puisieux, Alain; Diaz, Jean-Jacques","journal":"Cancer Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e887592355688a0cddb6c3c3ae9838b5665cf07.json; document_parses/pdf_json/34eb080bffbf37ee00246a39b1a22bd4b5eea49e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106277.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1535610813003590; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610813003590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24029231/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2013.08.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FBL overexpression","involvement of p53","p53 acts","ribosome quality","High levels of FBL","p53-inactivated cancer cells","breast cancer","Ribosome biogenesis","intrinsic activity of ribosomes","subsequent quality","ribozyme activity","increase of internal ribosome entry site","rRNA methylation pattern","dependent translation initiation of key cancer genes","regulation of gene expression","rRNA methyl-transferase fibrillarin","IRES","impairment of translational fidelity","poor survival","rRNAs","modifications","safeguard of protein synthesis","patients","tumorigenesis","binding","specialized entities"],"language":"en"},

However, nucleocapsid (N) protein of two arteriviruses, porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus and equine arteritis virus, has been observed to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus of virus-infected and N-gene-transfected cells in addition to their normal cytoplasmic distribution. In the present study, the N protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice was examined for nuclear localization. The subcellular localization of LDV-N was determined by tagging N with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) at the N- and C-terminus. Both N-EGFP and EGFP-N fusion proteins localized to the nucleus and nucleolus of gene-transfected cells. Labeled N also accumulated in the perinuclear region, the site of virus replication. The LDV-N sequence contains a putative \u2018pat4\u2019-type nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of 38-KKKK. To determine its functional significance, a series of deletion constructs of N were generated and individually expressed in cells. The results showed that the \u2018pat4\u2019 NLS was essential for nuclear translocation. In addition, the LDV-N interacted with the importin-\u03B1 and -\u03B2 proteins, suggesting that the LDV-N nuclear localization may occur via the importin-mediated nuclear transport pathway. These results provide further evidence for the nuclear localization of N as a common feature within the arteriviruses.","publish_time":"2009-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammadi, Hakimeh; Sharif, Shayan; Rowland, Raymond R.; Yoo, Dongwan","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/495da6e82a1cb1a87f9b2a1a16959eefda207656.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19517211/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-009-0410-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-EGFP","nuclear localization of N","N-gene","LDV-N nuclear localization","LDV-N sequence","EGFP-N fusion proteins","N protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","series of deletion constructs of N","nucleolus of virus","subcellular localization of LDV","virus multiplication","nuclear translocation","type nuclear localization signal","equine arteritis virus","site of virus replication","nuclear transport pathway","transfected cells","porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus","pat4","nucleolus of gene","NLS","nucleus function","addition","Arteriviruses replicate","results","enhanced green fluorescence protein","\u03B2 proteins","importin-\u03B1","mice","perinuclear region","common feature","normal cytoplasmic distribution","evidence","functional significance","present study","C-terminus","nucleocapsid","KKKK"],"language":"en"},

Procedure pathway, number of patient coughs, number of suctioning events, number of contacts with different surfaces by the pulmonologist, and the use and doffing of personal protective equipment were recorded by the investigator on a specially designed form. Any pulmonologist performing a bronchoscopy procedure was eligible to participate. A total of 18 procedures were observed. Mean particle number and mass concentrations were not elevated during procedures relative to those measured before or after the procedure, on average, but the concentrations were highly variable, exhibiting high levels periodically. Patients frequently coughed during procedures (median 65 coughs, range: 0\u2013565 coughs), and suctioning was commonly performed (median 6.5 suctioning events, range: 0\u201342).

This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, \u2018Colony Collapse Disorder\u2019); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen \u2018spillover\u2019 from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35\u2013100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover.","publish_time":"2008-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otterstatter, Michael C.; Thomson, James D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/103c89c60d7d24bb8432c4b7a61379f9e44fe6ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2464710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18648661/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002771","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["Wild bumble bees","evidence of pathogen spillover","commercial bees","wild bumble bee species","explicit model of pathogen spillover","reared bumble bees","wild bumble bee populations","months of spillover","spillover of Crithidia bombi","wild congeners","destructive pathogen","bee declines","commercial Bombus","ongoing decline of wild Bombus","greenhouses","bombi infection","Improved management of domestic bees","recent devastating losses of honey bees","North America","circumstantial evidence","reported declines","serious declines","available evidence","commercial hives","greenhouse crops","field","large epizootic wave of infection","possible cause","travelling wave of disease","attention","estimated parameter values","laboratory experiments","head","literature","prevalences of","conservation of insect pollinators","example","transmission","patterns of","fit","little understanding","overlap","parasite","ecosystem services\u2019","Colony Collapse Disorder","issue","rate"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to analyze the quantity and quality of research activity in the field of infectious diseases in Arab countries and compare it with that in non-Arab countries. METHODS: Documents published in Arab countries within the research category of \u201Cinfectious diseases\u201D were extracted and analyzed using the Web of Science database. The data analyzed represent research productivity during the time interval between 1900 \u2013 2012. RESULTS: Worldwide, the total number of documents published in the field of infectious diseases up to 2012 was 227,188. A total of 2,408 documents in the field of infectious diseases were published in Arab countries, which represents 1.06% of worldwide research output. Research output from Arab countries in the field of infectious diseases was low for decades. However, approximately a five-fold increase was observed in the past decade. Arab countries ranked 56(th) to 218(th) on the standard competition ranking (SCR) in worldwide publications in the field of infectious diseases. Egypt, with a total publication of 464 (19.27%) documents ranked first among Arab countries, while Kuwait University was the most productive institution with a total of 158 (6.56%) documents. Average citation per document published in Arab countries was 13.25 and the h-index was 64. Tuberculosis (230; 9.55%), malaria (223; 9.26%), and hepatitis (189; 7.8%) were the top three infectious diseases studied as according to the retrieved documents. CONCLUSION: The present data reveals that some Arab countries contribute significantly to the field of infectious diseases. However, Arab countries need to work harder to bridge the gap in this field. Compared with non-Arab countries in the Middle East, research output from Arab countries was high, but more efforts are needed to enhance the quality of this output.

This study examined Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence and risk factors among a representative sample of 18-49-year-old residents in Hong Kong. METHODS: Census boundary map of 412 constituency areas was used as primary sampling units to construct the sampling frame and, residential buildings and units were randomly selected using geospatial modelling. A questionnaire on sexual practice and health was conducted, and polymerase chain reaction was used to test the urine for genital chlamydial infection. Invitation letters were sent to the selected households and a team of interviewers were sent to recruit one subject per household. Prevalence data was weighted according to the 2011 census and risk factors identified through logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 881 participants (response rate of 24.5%), the overall Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was low at 1.4% (95%CI 0.8\u20132.5%) but sexually active young (18\u201326 years) women had relatively high prevalence (5.8%, 95%CI 1.7\u201318.2%) in Hong Kong. A unique U-shape disease burden was observed with peaks in younger and older (40\u201349 years) women. Amongst the sexually active women, the risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infection were: younger age (aOR = 25.4, 95% CI 2.81\u2013230); living alone (aOR = 8.99, 95% CI 1.46\u201355.40); and, among all the sexually active participants, males (including the male partners of the female participants) who had travelled out of Hong Kong in the previous 12 months had higher risks of infection (aOR = 5.35; 95% CI 1.25\u201322.8). A core-peripheral geographical distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was also observed. CONCLUSION: Young and older sexually active women in Hong Kong have high prevalence of chlamydia. Routine screening for sexually active women and young men should be considered. Further research on testing feasibility and linkage-to-care are urgently needed to control the infection.","publish_time":"2017-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, William Chi Wai; Zhao, Yanping; Wong, Ngai Sze; Parish, William L.; Miu, Heidi Yin Hai; Yang, Li-Gang; Emch, Michael; Ho, King Man; Fong, Francois Yeung; Tucker, Joseph D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec057f679419810619852bd937fdab879a30e1ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5321413.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225805/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172561","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["active women","high prevalence of chlamydia","risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infection","overall Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence","active young","active participants","Hong Kong","risk of HIV infection","Prevalence data","effective infection control","aOR","core-peripheral geographical distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence","higher risks of infection","genital chlamydial infection","years","young men","female participants","primary sampling units","sampling frame","younger age","selected households","Census boundary map","essential information","population-based studies","constituency areas","months","health","peaks","unique U-shape disease burden","infertility","male partners","linkage","residential buildings","urine","prevention","males","representative sample","study","testing feasibility","team of interviewers","year-old residents","logistic regression","Routine screening","polymerase chain reaction","questionnaire","sexual practice","research","METHODS","CONCLUSION","Invitation letters","response rate","subject","care","geospatial modelling","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

A standard curve was plotted using 10-fold serial dilution of standard plasmid DNA and Ct value. The standard curve was found to be linear over a 10(\u22127) dilution. The real-time PCR results were expressed as the number of DNA copies of CPV 2 per mg of faecal samples and showed range of 1.0 \u00D7 10(3) to 7.0 \u00D7 10(9) copies of viral DNA per mg of stool samples. The analytical sensitivity of the SYBR Green based real-time PCR was shown to be equivalent to 10 copies. Faecal samples (47) from dogs suspected of CPV 2 infection were analyzed by real-time PCR, haemagglutination (HA) assay and by a conventional PCR and 24, 20 and 22 samples were found positive for CPV 2, respectively. Comparison between the results of three different assays revealed that real-time PCR is more sensitive than HA and conventional PCR and allow the detection of low titers of CPV 2 in infected dogs.","publish_time":"2010-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Manoj; Nandi, Sukdeb","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e929f901fbdd9d3aab8e8c5da76e40985d9cb1d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119530.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093410002193; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093410002193; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green","CPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time PCR results","conventional PCR","SYBR Green based real-time PCR","faecal samples of dogs","number of DNA copies of CPV","stool samples","detection of low titers of CPV","standard curve","copies of viral DNA","development of SYBR Green based real-time polymerase chain reaction","nucleotide sequence of VP2 gene of CPV","infected dogs","fold serial dilution of standard plasmid DNA","quantitation of canine parvovirus type","Ct value","analytical sensitivity","different assays","haemagglutination","infection","present study","custom","primers","Comparison","range"],"language":"en"},

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are key components of antiviral immunity that detect conserved molecular features of viral pathogens and initiate signalling that results in the expression of antiviral genes. In this Review, we discuss the strategies that viruses use to escape immune surveillance by key intracellular sensors of viral RNA or DNA, with a focus on RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS) and interferon-\u03B3 (IFN\u03B3)-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). Such viral strategies include the sequestration or modification of viral nucleic acids, interference with specific post-translational modifications of PRRs or their adaptor proteins, the degradation or cleavage of PRRs or their adaptors, and the sequestration or relocalization of PRRs. An understanding of viral immune-evasion mechanisms at the molecular level may guide the development of vaccines and antivirals.","publish_time":"2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Ying Kai; Gack, Michaela U.","journal":"Nature Reviews Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0150b2d0c4f75faf01a869d3f5109fca50aab5c3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1cb17fc57f0e112046b9e5d4fee08a4e79827da2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5072394.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2016.45; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5072394?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27174148/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral strategies","emergence of viral pathogens","cleavage of PRRs","relocalization of PRRs","conserved molecular features of viral pathogens","modification of viral nucleic acids","key intracellular sensors of viral RNA","understanding of viral immune-evasion mechanisms","sequestration","key components of antiviral immunity","specific post-translational modifications of PRRs","molecular level","immune surveillance","host immunity","Pattern recognition receptors","expression of antiviral genes","co-evolution of viruses","interference","cGAS","cyclic GMP","DNA","AMP synthase","adaptor proteins","initiate signalling","interferon-\u03B3","adept","evading","inducible protein","IFN\u03B3","hosts","RLRs","degradation","adaptors","development of vaccines","focus","RIG","antivirals"],"language":"en"},

The pre-hybridizing oligo and target DNA are differentiated by being labeled with two distinct fluorescent dyes, and the cooperative effect on hybridization efficiency is investigated through the comparison of the stacking and individual hybridization configurations based on the detection signals of the labeling dyes.

Ifitm3 was expressed by IAV target cells including alveolar type II pneumocytes and tracheal/bronchial respiratory epithelial cells. Robust Ifitm3 expression was also observed in several tissues in the absence of infection. Among murine Ifitm promoters, only that of Ifitm3 could be induced by type I and II interferons. Ifitm3 could also be upregulated by the gp130 cytokines IL-6 and oncostatin M on cells expressing appropriate receptors, suggesting that multiple cytokine signals could contribute to Ifitm3 expression in a cell or tissue-specific manner.

Here, two highly divergent BOVs (tentatively named as Himalayan marmot BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the livers and feces of wild Himalayan marmots in China, by viral metagenomic analysis. Five of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five of 99 fecal samples from these animals for HMBOV2. Their nearly complete genome sequences are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic organization and containing protein-coding motifs typical for BOVs.

The second mechanism makes a prematurely terminated (\u2212)-strand RNA which is used as template to make the SG RNA. The third mechanism uses discontinuous RNA synthesis while making the (\u2212)-strand RNA templates. Most SG RNAs are translated into structural proteins or proteins related to pathogenesis: however other SG RNAs regulate the transition between translation and replication, function as riboregulators of replication or translation, or support RNA\u2013RNA recombination.

Methods: Based on the epidemic data of COVID-19 openly accessed from national health authorities, we estimated the dynamic basic reproduction number R(0)(t) to evaluate the effects of the current COVID-19 prevention and control strategies in all the provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) as well as in Wuhan and the changes in infectivity of COVID-19 over time. Results: For the stability of the results, 24 provinces (municipality) with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in the analysis. At the beginning of the outbreak, the R(0)(t) showed unstable trend with big variances. As the strengthening of the prevention and control strategies, R(0)(t) began to show a downward trend in late January, and became stable in February. By the time of data analysis, 18 provinces (municipality) (75%) had the R(0)(t)s less than 1. The results could be used for the decision making to free population floating conditionally.

Furthermore, recent advanced systems allow controlled expression of the effector RNA via coexpression of a tetracycline/doxycycline (DOX) responsive repressor (tTR-KRAB). Herein, this system was utilized to assess the antiviral effects of LV-encoded shRNAs targeting three conserved regions on the pregenomic RNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV), namely the region coding for the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the viral polymerase (LV-HBV-shRNA1), the core promoter (CP; LV-HBV-shRNA2), and the direct repeat 1 (DR1; LV-HBV-shRNA3). Transduction of just the LV-HBV-shRNA vectors into the stably HBV expressing HepG2.2.15 cell line showed significant reductions in secreted HBsAg and HBeAg, intracellular HBcAg as well as HBV RNA and DNA replicative intermediates for all vectors, however, most pronouncedly for the DR1-targeting shRNA3. The corresponding vector was therefore applied in the DOX-controlled system. Notably, strong interference with HBV replication was found in the presence of the inducer DOX whereas the antiviral effect was essentially ablated in its absence; hence, the silencing effect of the shRNA and consequently HBV replication could be strictly regulated by DOX. This newly established system may therefore provide a valuable platform to study the antiviral efficacy of RNA drugs against HBV in a regulated manner, and even be applicable in vivo.

The objective of our prospective study was to investigate HCoVs associations with various clinical presentations in hospitalized children up to 6 years of age. Children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), or febrile seizures (FS), and children admitted for elective surgical procedures (healthy controls) were included in the study. In patients with AB, AGE, and FS, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and blood sample were obtained upon admission and the follow-up visit 14 days later, whereas in children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission; in healthy controls a NP swab and stool sample were taken upon admission. Amplification of polymerase 1b gene was used to detect HCoVs in the specimens. HCoVs-positive specimens were also examined for the presence of several other viruses. HCoVs were most often detected in children with FS (19/192, 9.9%, 95% CI: 6\u201315%), followed by children with AGE (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3\u201313.3%) and AB (20/308, 6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0\u20139.8%). The presence of other viruses was a common finding, most frequent in the group of children with AB (19/20, 95%, 95% CI: 75.1\u201399.8%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9\u201375.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%, 95% CI: 16.3\u201361.6%). In healthy control children HCoVs were detected in 3/156 (1.9%, 95% CI: 0.4\u20135.5%) NP swabs and 1/150 (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.02\u20133.3%) stool samples. It seems that an etiological role of HCoVs is most likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, the co-detection of other viruses was 52.6%.

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO2, NO x , PM2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16\u201326%, 29\u201347%, 27\u201346% and 37\u201357% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%\u201361%, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations range between 15 and 79 \u03BCg m\u22123, which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM2.5 comes from industry (32.2\u201361.1%), mobile (3.9\u20138.1%), dust (2.6\u20137.7%), residential sources (2.1\u201328.5%) in YRD and 14.0\u201328.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Li; Li, Qing; Huang, Ling; Wang, Qian; Zhu, Ansheng; Xu, Jian; Liu, Ziyi; Li, Hongli; Shi, Lishu; Li, Rui; Azari, Majid; Wang, Yangjun; Zhang, Xiaojuan; Liu, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Yonghui; Zhang, Kun; Xue, Shuhui; Ooi, Maggie Chel Gee; Zhang, Dongping; Chan, Andy","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74d33cb7e1dfbff481807a161b4963d8d2e3ba4e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720327996?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413621/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720327996; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139282","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YRD Region"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["air quality changes","improvement of air quality","Level","primary air pollutant emissions","current air pollution","primary emissions reduction","long-term air pollution plan","residual pollution of PM2","Concentrations of PM2","human activities","VOCs emissions","daily average PM2","emission reduction","lowered SO2","national lockdown policies","Source apportionment results","impact of human activity pattern changes","industrial strategy","industrial operations","northern China","residual pollutions","YRD Region","outbreak of COVID","trans-regional joint-control","monitoring data","significant role","WRF-CAMx modelling system","energy","VKT","virus","contribution","long-range transport","constructions","social distancing","extreme reductions","Re-organisation","background","rapid dispersion","spite","response periods","NO2","product","residential sources","\u03BCg","ozone","industry","account","world"],"language":"en"},

In inflammation, CD13 is expressed on myeloid cells, is up-regulated on endothelial cells at sites of inflammation and mediates monocyte/endothelial adhesion by homotypic interactions. In animal models the lack of CD13 alters the profiles of infiltrating inflammatory cells at sites of ischaemic injury. Here, we found that CD13 expression is enriched specifically on the pro-inflammatory subset of monocytes, suggesting that CD13 may regulate trafficking and function of specific subsets of immune cells. To further dissect the mechanisms regulating CD13-dependent trafficking we used the murine model of thioglycollate-induced sterile peritonitis. Peritoneal monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells were significantly decreased in inflammatory exudates from global CD13(KO) animals when compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of wild-type and CD13(KO) primary myeloid cells, or wild-type myeloid cells pre-treated with CD13-blocking antibodies into thioglycollate-challenged wild-type recipients demonstrated fewer CD13(KO) or treated cells in the lavage, suggesting that CD13 expression confers a competitive advantage in trafficking. Similarly, both wild-type and CD13(KO) cells were reduced in infiltrates in CD13(KO) recipients, confirming that both monocytic and endothelial CD13 contribute to trafficking. Finally, murine monocyte cell lines expressing mouse/human chimeric CD13 molecules demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of the protein mediates CD13 adhesion. Therefore, this work verifies that the altered inflammatory trafficking in CD13(KO) mice is the result of aberrant myeloid cell subset trafficking and further defines the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation.","publish_time":"2014-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Mallika; Gerber, Claire; Rahman, M Mamunur; Vernier, Kaitlyn M; Pereira, Flavia E; Subramani, Jaganathan; Caromile, Leslie A; Shapiro, Linda H","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96d17dc2d9fbfbe45112efeb68d7bd4839e36775.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4107673.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627994/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endothelial CD13","CD13 adhesion","CD13 expression","fewer CD13","global CD13","lack of CD13","CD13-dependent trafficking","KO","endothelial cells","wild-type myeloid cells","human chimeric CD13 molecules","dendritic cells","treated cells","primary myeloid cells","wild-type recipients","profiles of infiltrating inflammatory cells","altered inflammatory trafficking","wild-type controls","result of aberrant myeloid cell subset trafficking","function of specific subsets of immune cells","inflammatory exudates","endothelial adhesion","adoptive transfer of wild","pro-inflammatory subset of monocytes","sites of inflammation","murine monocyte cell lines","murine model of thioglycollate","Peritoneal monocytes","molecular mechanisms","sites of ischaemic injury","mouse","mice","C-terminal domain","animals","infiltrates","tissues","transmembrane metalloproteinase","Aminopeptidase N","homotypic interactions","macrophages","competitive advantage","lavage","monocytic","antibodies","sterile peritonitis","various cellular functions","animal models","work","regulation"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe a discovery platform that utilizes self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors for the surface display of high-affinity single-chain variable region (scFv) antibody fragments on human cells and lentivirus particles. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bivalent scFvFc human antibodies were fused in frame with different transmembrane (TM) anchoring moieties to allow efficient high-level expression on human cells and the optimal TM was identified. The addition of an eight amino acid HIV-1 gp41 envelope incorporation motif further increased scFvFc expression on human cells and incorporation into lentiviral particles. Both antibody-displaying human cells and virus particles bound antigen specifically. Sulfation of CDR tyrosine residues, a property recently shown to broaden antibody binding affinity and antigen recognition was also demonstrated. High level scFvFc expression and stable integration was achieved in human cells following transduction with IRES containing bicistronic SIN lentivectors encoding ZsGreen when scFvFc fusion proteins were expressed from the first cassette. Up to 10(6)-fold enrichment of antibody expressing cells was achieved with one round of antigen coupled magnetic bead pre-selection followed by FACS sorting. Finally, the scFvFc displaying human cells could be used directly in functional biological screens with remarkable sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This antibody display platform will complement existing technologies by virtue of providing properties unique to lentiviruses and antibody expression in human cells, which, in turn, may aid the discovery of novel therapeutic human mAbs.","publish_time":"2008-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taube, Ran; Zhu, Quan; Xu, Chen; Diaz-Griffero, Felipe; Sui, Jianhua; Kamau, Erick; Dwyer, Markryan; Aird, Daniel; Marasco, Wayne A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/524020333ab93c945ffd02838cb08672703724c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2527531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18784843/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDR","IRES","FACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human cells","antibody expression","Bivalent scFvFc human antibodies","Isolation of human antibodies","increased scFvFc expression","antibody display platform","antibody fragments","High level scFvFc expression","protein expression","antibody binding affinity","discovery of novel therapeutic human mAbs","fold enrichment of antibody","lentiviral particles","efficient high-level expression","scFvFc fusion proteins","surface display of high","current display technologies","discovery platform","round of antigen","antigen recognition","lentivirus particles","existing technologies","lentiviral vectors","optimal TM","bicistronic SIN lentivectors","gp41 envelope incorporation motif","affinity single-chain variable region","anchoring moieties","ZsGreen","IRES","lentiviruses","stable integration","magnetic bead pre-selection","properties unique","amino acid HIV","virtue","self-inactivating","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","transduction","frame","property","FACS sorting","functional biological screens","remarkable sensitivity","METHODOLOGY","constraints","SIGNIFICANCE","Sulfation of CDR tyrosine residues","post-translational modifications","addition","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","turn","cassette"],"language":"en"},

Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important. Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection. We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria. We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al., Lighter J et al., and Simonnet A et al.) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care. Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al., reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m(2), OR: 7.36 (1.63\u201333.14; p = 0.021). This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19.

However, the molecular antiviral mechanisms of chickens to IBV infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney tissue after nephropathogenic IBV infection to better understand the interactions between host and virus. RESULTS: IBV infection contributed to differential expression of 1777 genes, of which 876 were up-regulated and 901 down-regulated in the kidney compared to those of control chickens and 103 associated with immune and inflammatory responses may play important roles in the host defense response during IBV infection. Twelve of the altered immune-related genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Gene ontology category, KEGG pathway, and gene interaction networks (STRING analysis) were analyzed to identify relationships among differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune responses, apoptosis regulation, positive regulation of the I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade and response to cytokine stimulus. Most of these genes were related and formed a large network, in which IL6, STAT1, MYD88, IRF1 and NFKB2 were key genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided comprehensive knowledge regarding the host transcriptional response to IBV infection in chicken kidney tissues, thereby providing insight into IBV pathogenesis, particularly the involvement of innate immune pathway genes associated with IBV infection.","publish_time":"2013-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cong, Feng; Liu, Xiaoli; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b94abc8c5e511d49e02cc4175cccc27629f5ee76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3870970.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24168272/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-743","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nephropathogenic IBV infection","IBV pathogenesis","key genes","altered immune-related genes","immune responses","involvement of innate immune pathway genes","host transcriptional response","host defense response","chicken kidney tissues","Infectious bronchitis virus","control chickens","RESULTS","global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney tissue","gene interaction networks","Gene ontology category","important causative agent of infectious bronchitis","apoptosis regulation","positive regulation","KEGG pathway","important roles","inflammatory responses","differential expression","molecular antiviral mechanisms of chickens","NF-kappaB cascade","I-kappaB kinase","cell adhesion","IRF1","comprehensive knowledge","signal transduction","contagious upper respiratory tract infections","IL6","STAT1","MYD88","NFKB2","insight","STRING analysis","cytokine stimulus","prototype","BACKGROUND","interactions","Coronaviridae family","real-time RT-PCR","CONCLUSIONS","large network","study","nephritis","relationships"],"language":"en"},

However, many respiratory viruses and bacteria trigger similar respiratory symptoms and it is possible that the important risk factors for asthma are the underlying susceptibility to infection and the exaggerated reaction to such triggers rather than the particular triggering agent. Objective We sought to study the association between specific infections in early life and development of asthma later in childhood. Methods Three hundred thirteen children were followed prospectively in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies of Asthma in Childhood2000 high-risk birth cohort. Nine respiratory virus types (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses AH1, AH3, and B, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus) and 3 pathogenic airway bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were identified in airway secretions sampled during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life. Asthma was determined by age 7 years. Results In unadjusted analyses, all viruses and pathogenic bacteria identified during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms were associated with increased risk of asthma by age 7 years with similar odds ratios for all viruses and pathogenic bacteria. After adjustment for the frequency of respiratory episodes, the particular triggers were no longer associated with asthma. Conclusion The number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, was associated with later asthma development. This suggests that future research should focus on the susceptibility and exaggerated response to lower respiratory tract infections in general rather than on the specific triggering agent.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F8nnelykke, Klaus; Vissing, Nadja Hawwa; Sevelsted, Astrid; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Bisgaard, Hans","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c372708bb8795659da16d6916638d6abc6675459.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112259.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674915003255; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2015.02.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674915003255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of asthma","respiratory syncytial virus","similar respiratory symptoms","frequency of respiratory episodes","number of respiratory episodes","later asthma development","respiratory virus types","years of life","increased risk of asthma","potential causal role of specific respiratory viruses","Background Lower respiratory tract infections","parainfluenza viruses","pathogenic bacteria","pathogenic airway bacteria","specific infections","Copenhagen Prospective Studies of Asthma","episodes of troublesome lung symptoms","influenza viruses AH1","early life","particular triggers","specific triggering agent","particular triggering agent","rhinoviruses","particular viral trigger","focus","underlying susceptibility","exaggerated response","airway secretions","exaggerated reaction","similar odds ratios","important risk factors","Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","AH3","picornaviruses","bocavirus","Childhood2000 high-risk birth cohort","human metapneumovirus","coronaviruses","Moraxella catarrhalis","OC43","association","unadjusted analyses","adenoviruses","Results","Conclusion","adjustment","observation","children","future research","Methods","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Despite global efforts, the potential for an associated pandemic in the future cannot be excluded. The development of effective counter-measures is urgent. MERS-CoV-specific anti-viral drugs or vaccines are not yet available. Using the spike receptor-binding domain of MERS-CoV (MERS-RBD) to immunize mice, we identified two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 4C2 and 2E6. Both mAbs potently bind to MERS-RBD and block virus entry in vitro with high efficacy. We further investigated their mechanisms of neutralization by crystallizing the complex between the Fab fragments and the RBD, and solved the structure of the 4C2 Fab/MERS-RBD complex. The structure showed that 4C2 recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps the receptor-binding footprint in MERS-RBD, thereby interfering with the virus/receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and interface-residue competition. 2E6 also blocks receptor binding, and competes with 4C2 for binding to MERS-RBD. Based on the structure, we further humanized 4C2 by preserving only the paratope residues and substituting the remaining amino acids with the counterparts from human immunoglobulins. The humanized 4C2 (4C2h) antibody sustained similar neutralizing activity and biochemical characteristics to the parental mouse antibody. Finally, we showed that 4C2h can significantly abate the virus titers in lungs of Ad5-hCD26-transduced mice infected with MERS-CoV, therefore representing a promising agent for prophylaxis and therapy in clinical settings.","publish_time":"2015-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yan; Wan, Yuhua; Liu, Peipei; Zhao, Jincun; Lu, Guangwen; Qi, Jianxun; Wang, Qihui; Lu, Xuancheng; Wu, Ying; Liu, Wenjun; Zhang, Buchang; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Perlman, Stanley; Gao, George F; Yan, Jinghua","journal":"Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fb29b70a642337fe87dea06a8b8c0269e9bf50f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4650419.xml.json","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015113.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2015.113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26391698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","MERS-RBD complex","4C2 Fab","humanized 4C2","receptor binding","spike receptor-binding domain of MERS","receptor-binding footprint","structure","receptor interactions","virus titers","4C2h","mAbs","2E6","block virus entry","Fab fragments","similar neutralizing activity","neutralizing monoclonal antibodies","hCD26-transduced mice","parental mouse antibody","fatal acute respiratory disease","emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","biochemical characteristics","steric hindrance","specific anti-viral drugs","remaining amino acids","lungs of Ad5","prophylaxis","therapy","counterparts","vaccines","paratope residues","promising agent","interface-residue competition","potential","humans","high efficacy","development of effective counter-measures","associated pandemic","clinical settings","human immunoglobulins","epitope","global efforts","future","mechanisms of neutralization"],"language":"en"},

In some instances, inhalation or ingestion would mimic the natural route by which humans are exposed to these agents. In other instances, (e.g., the inhalation of a toxin is normally associated with food borne illness), it would represent an unnatural route of exposure.

Although oral cGVHD occurs in \u003E25 % of cGVHD patients and leads to decreased quality of life, its etiology is poorly understood. The present retrospective cross-sectional analysis of oral cGVHD patients sought to (1) test the feasibility of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify protein biomarkers of oral cGVHD and (2) to gain a clearer understanding of salivary proteins impacted by oral cGVHD. METHODS: Using unstimulated whole saliva, we compared pooled saliva from five patients with a diagnosis of moderate or severe oral cGVHD, with a gender-and age- matched pool of five cGVHD patients with no oral mucosal findings. LC-MS/MS was used to identify salivary proteins, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Selected mass spectrometric findings, including lactotransferrin, lactoperoxidase, and albumin, were confirmed by targeted label-free quantification. RESULTS: LC-MS/MS led to confident identification of 180 proteins. Of these proteins, 102 changed in abundance at least 2 fold, including 12 proteins identified only in the No oral cGVHD group. Downregulation of ~0.4 fold was confirmed for both lactotransferrin and lactoperoxidase in Oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification. IPA analysis implicated pathways involved in cellular metabolism and immunoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of salivary lactoperoxidase, lactotransferrin, and several cysteine proteinase inhibitor family proteins suggests impaired oral antimicrobial host immunity in cGVHD patients. This shotgun proteomic analysis of oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification of select proteins supports the use of mass spectrometry for future validation in a large patient population as noninvasive tests for screening, early detection, and monitoring of cGVHD.

Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks. METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their correlation with the number of cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in China, respectively. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the previous day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of cases showed a rapid increase in case load. Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to ensure preparedness at both the individual and organization levels and to prevent new outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ze-Liang; Zhang, Qi; Lu, Yi; Guo, Zhong-Min; Zhang, Xi; Zhang, Wen-Jun; Guo, Cheng; Liao, Cong-Hui; Li, Qian-Lin; Han, Xiao-Hu; Lu, Jia-Hai","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f994d7e4dda4fe71ec829ae1700f1c51b0d9e3dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147281.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000000782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Baidu Qianxi"],"locations":["China","Wuhan","Hubei"],"keyphrases":["low number of cases","provincial number of cases","death cases","total cases","COVID","cities","time risk of Hubei province","Wuhan city","population emigration","risk trends","population migration","source of virus infection","correlation coefficient","new outbreaks","case distribution","case load","epidemic","lockdown","China","official case report","main infection source","early warning","early stage","following day","previous day","Corona Virus Disease","Hot spot provinces","prevention of future outbreaks","ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia","Yunnan","implementation of nationwide control measures","exponential growth","rapid increase","preparedness","upcoming Spring Festival return wave","Sichuan","different regions","organization levels","great importance","BACKGROUND","times","Data","Baidu Qianxi","location information","individual","METHODS","ArcGIS","WinBUGS software","people","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","peak"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. METHODS: Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54\u20135.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36\u20133.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27\u20137.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12\u20134.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chew, Nicholas W.S.; Lee, Grace K.H.; Tan, Benjamin Y.Q.; Jing, Mingxue; Goh, Yihui; Ngiam, Nicholas J.H.; Yeo, Leonard L.L.; Ahmad, Aftab; Ahmed Khan, Faheem; Napolean Shanmugam, Ganesh; Sharma, Arvind K.; Komalkumar, R.N.; Meenakshi, P.V.; Shah, Kenam; Patel, Bhargesh; Chan, Bernard P.L.; Sunny, Sibi; Chandra, Bharatendu; Ong, Jonathan J.Y.; Paliwal, Prakash R.; Wong, Lily Y.H.; Sagayanathan, Renarebecca; Chen, Jin Tao; Ying Ng, Alison Ying; Teoh, Hock Luen; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Ho, Cyrus S.; Ho, Roger C.; Sharma, Vijay K.","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85bf31cc4b6bd1918e6e03a274aa7470c223d39d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172854.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120305237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330593/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120305237; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","Depression Anxiety Stress Scales","Linear"],"locations":["Singapore","India"],"keyphrases":["presence of physical symptoms","allied healthcare workers","experienced symptoms","increased prevalence of physical symptoms","severe stress","maintenance workers","Depression Anxiety Stress Scales","severe anxiety","severe depression","psychological outcomes of depression","DASS Anxiety","Depression subscales","symptom prevalence","COVID","PTSD","severe levels of psychological distress","post-traumatic stress disorder","preceding month","timely psychological interventions","past month","IES-R","significant association","study","outbreak","pre-existing comorbidities","positive screen","self-administered questionnaire","commonest reported symptom","large number of participants","administrators","nurses","clerical staff","medical history","demographics","doctors","associations","higher mean scores","major hospitals","information","patients","Impact of Events Scale","headache","declaration","Singapore","METHODS","general population","Linear regression","India","period","age","gender","CONCLUSIONS","coronavirus","instrument","pandemic","survey","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","infection"],"language":"en"},

Highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota against both RV and TGEV, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to Enterococcus faecium PCK38, Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC179, Lactobacillus pentosus PCA227 and Lactobacillus plantarum PCA236 and PCS22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. A variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of NO\u2212 and H2O2 (ROS) was obtained when LAB strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be LAB strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ROS release in more than one cell line. In contrast, the ability of the examined LAB strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was LAB strain but not cell line specific. Highest attachment ability was observed with L. plantarum ACA-DC 146, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans ACA-DC 4037 and E. faecium PCD71. Clear indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the L. casei Shirota against TGEV and with L. plantarum PCA236 againt both RV and TGEV. In the rest of the cases, each interaction was LAB-cell line\u2013virus specific, barring general conclusions. However, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. Further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maragkoudakis, Petros A.; Chingwaru, Walter; Gradisnik, Lidija; Tsakalidou, Effie; Cencic, Avrelija","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/353253dbab75f1dbaa3a55de166b3c5b97bbabf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114074.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160509006771; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168160509006771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20106541/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.12.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAB-cell line","cell line specific","cell line monolayers","cell lines","macrophage cell line models","examined LAB strains","attachment ability of LAB","antiviral effect","Various strains","Lactobacillus plantarum PCA236","Lactobacillus casei Shirota","notable antiviral activity","virus specific","TGEV disruption","plantarum ACA-DC","selection of probiotic strains","small number of strains","Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC179","viral RV","Lactobacillus pentosus PCA227","strong ROS release","Highest attachment ability","potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria","plantarum PCA236 againt","tolerans ACA-DC","virus combination","known probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Highest protection effects","monolayer protection","faecium PCD71","Enterococcus faecium PCK38","farm animal applications","possible mechanism responsible","induction of reactive oxygen species","trials","system","PCS22","nature","paracasei","basis of previous","interaction","tumor origin","results","general conclusions","order","underlying mode of action","rotavirus","cases","Clear indications","rest","contrast","study","H2O2","end","variable increase","investigations"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate correlations between the CXR score and the age or sex of Italian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 4, 2020, and March 18, 2020, all CXR reports containing the new scoring system were retrieved. Only hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. For each patient, age, sex, and the CXR report containing the highest score were considered for the analysis. Patients were also divided into seven groups according to age. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to examine the relationship between the severity of lung disease and the age or sex. RESULTS: 783 Italian patients (532 males and 251 females) with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The CXR score was significantly higher in males than in females only in groups aged 50 to 79 years. A significant correlation was observed between the CXR score and age in both males and females. Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older with coronavirus disease 2019 showed the highest CXR score (median \u2265 8). CONCLUSIONS: Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older showed the highest risk of developing severe lung disease. Our results may help to identify the highest-risk patients and those who require specific treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borghesi, Andrea; Zigliani, Angelo; Masciullo, Roberto; Golemi, Salvatore; Maculotti, Patrizia; Farina, Davide; Maroldi, Roberto","journal":"Radiol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df7ec32ba27a2c029e6585fc2ec112242590bf8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358691/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01202-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Diagnostic Imaging Department","CXR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["highest CXR score","years","age","females","highest score","highest-risk patients","CXR reports","SARS-CoV","sex of Italian patients","highest risk","hospitalized patients","risk stratification of patients","severe lung disease","coronavirus disease","severity of lung disease","infection","groups","PURPOSE","RESULTS","quantifying lung abnormalities","new scoring system","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","relationship","experimental chest X-ray","Diagnostic Imaging Department","specific treatment strategies","correlations","median","Nonparametric statistical tests","significant correlation","study","analysis","CONCLUSIONS","MATERIALS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of these 2 studies was to investigate the safety and efficacy of PrEP-001 prophylaxis against rhinovirus (HRV-A16) and influenza-A (H3N2-IAV). METHODS Healthy subjects randomly received 2 doses of PrEP-001 or placebo, 48 and 24 h pre-challenge with 10 TCID50 of HRV-A16 (Study 1) or H3N2-IAV (Study 2). RESULTS In Study 1, PrEP-001 reduced median total symptom score from 38.5 to 4.5 (p = 0.004), median symptom duration from 6.0 to 1.7 days and median mucus production from 15 g to 3 g. The percentage of subjects classified as ill was reduced 3-fold (placebo 73%, PrEP-001 23%, p = 0.002). In Study 2, PrEP-001 reduced median total symptom score from 8.0 to 4.1 (p = 0.021), median symptom duration from 4.6 to 3.7 days and median mucus production from 3.6 g to 1.5 g. The percentage of subjects classified as ill was reduced 2-fold (placebo 48%, PrEP-001 24%, p = 0.064). PrEP-001 reduced peak viral shedding in both studies, as assessed by qRT-PCR of nasal lavage. Seroconversion rates were comparable between placebo and PrEP-001 (Study 1: 77% [both arms]; Study 2: placebo 73%, PrEP-001 80%). PrEP-001 was well-tolerated, with no clinically significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS PrEP-001 reduced the number of individuals with clinical illness and attenuated severity and duration of HRV-A16 and H3N2-IAV infections without compromising seroconversion, and was well-tolerated. This supports further evaluation of PrEP-001 as a potential pan-viral prophylaxis for upper respiratory tract infections.

NMD plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, cell viability, DNA damage response, while also serving as a barrier to virus infection. Disturbance of this control mechanism caused by genetic mutations or dys-regulation of the NMD pathway can lead to pathologies, including neurological disorders, immune diseases and cancers. The role of NMD in cancer development is complex, acting as both a promoter and a barrier to tumour progression. Cancer cells can exploit NMD for the downregulation of key tumour suppressor genes, or tumours adjust NMD activity to adapt to an aggressive immune microenvironment. The latter case might provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention as NMD inhibition has been shown to lead to the production of neoantigens that stimulate an immune system attack on tumours. For this reason, understanding the biology and co-option pathways of NMD is important for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Inhibitors, whose design can make use of the many structures available for NMD study, will play a crucial role in characterizing and providing diverse therapeutic options for this pathway in cancer and other diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pawlicka, Kamila; Kalathiya, Umesh; Alfaro, Javier","journal":"Cancers (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5817479c9aa2b32021af3d294075e71f2fc9b873.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213869/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12030765","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of NMD","NMD pathway","NMD study","NMD activity","NMD inhibition","co-option pathways of NMD","important role","immune diseases","cancer development","Cancer cells","therapeutic intervention","crucial role","tumours","surveillance pathway","barrier","development of novel therapeutic agents","cell cycle regulation","diverse therapeutic options","immune system attack","aggressive immune microenvironment","cell viability","dys-regulation","tumour progression","control mechanism","downregulation of key tumour suppressor genes","decay","Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA","DNA damage response","genetic mutations","neurological disorders","characterizing","avenue","pathologies","use","quality mRNAs","promoter","cancers","biology","structures available","transcript abundance","production of neoantigens","Inhibitors","design","reason","virus infection","Disturbance"],"language":"en"},

These bioactive molecules are often secondary metabolites, whose main function is to enable and/or modulate cellular communication and defense. They are usually produced by functional enzyme clusters in sponges and/or their associated symbiotic microorganisms. Natural product lead compounds from sponges have often been found to be promising pharmaceutical agents. Several of them have successfully been approved as antiviral agents for clinical use or have been advanced to the late stages of clinical trials. Most of these drugs are used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The most important antiviral lead of marine origin reported thus far is nucleoside Ara-A (vidarabine) isolated from sponge Tethya crypta. It inhibits viral DNA polymerase and DNA synthesis of herpes, vaccinica and varicella zoster viruses. However due to the discovery of new types of viruses and emergence of drug resistant strains, it is necessary to develop new antiviral lead compounds continuously. Several sponge derived antiviral lead compounds which are hopedto be developed as future drugs are discussed in this review. Supply problems are usually the major bottleneck to the development of these compounds as drugs during clinical trials. However advances in the field of metagenomics and high throughput microbial cultivation has raised the possibility that these techniques could lead to the cost-effective large scale production of such compounds.

Methods for rapid detection of pathogens are needed to effectively treat these diseases. Recently, we developed new methods for the rapid determination of viral RNA sequences, RDV ver1.0 and ver2.0. We demonstrated that these methods were able to simultaneously detect cDNA fragments of many different viruses without using sequence specific primers. However, some species of viruses, including the Yokose virus (YOKV), a flavivirus, could not be detected using the conventional procedures. Objective The RDV method was further modified to reduce the candidate PCR primer sets. Study design Primer sets were reduced to 256 sets in the improved RDV ver3.0, and theoretically, all viral cDNA fragments ligated by two kinds of adaptors after digestion by two restriction enzymes could be amplified in the PCR step for direct sequencing. Results We succeeded in obtaining 118 YOKV cDNA fragments of the 141 sequence fragments. The cDNA fragments covered diverse range of viral genome. Conclusion We were able to reduce the combinations of PCR primer sets used in the RDV method. This RDV method ver3.0 has a potential to detect viral cDNA fragments of both known and unknown RNA viruses rapidly and conveniently.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watanabe, Shumpei; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Sakai, Kouji; Kato, Kentaro; Tohya, Yukinobu; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Saijo, Masayuki; Yoshikawa, Yasuhiro; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru; Akashi, Hiroomi","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9a86808a124d6f066162dda4c8b513e417bad2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108420.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653208001832; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2008.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18595773/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653208001832","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RDV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral cDNA fragments","YOKV cDNA fragments","sequence fragments","RDV method ver3","RDV ver1","combinations of PCR primer sets","candidate PCR primer sets","improved RDV ver3","Study design Primer sets","rapid determination of viral RNA sequences","different viruses","unknown RNA viruses","PCR step","species of viruses","new methods","diverse range of viral genome","infectious diseases","sequence specific primers","rapid detection of pathogens","significant risk","kinds of adaptors","potential","digestion","Yokose virus","public health","restriction enzymes","Abstract Background","direct sequencing","flavivirus","ver2","Objective","conventional procedures","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study at a single, university-affiliated center was performed to evaluate the respiratory viral infection etiologies in children compared to that in adults and to document the clinical features of common viral infections for adults from July 2009 to April 2012. RESULTS: The common viruses detected from children (2,800 total patients) were human rhinovirus (hRV) (31.8%), adenovirus (AdV) (19.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A (17.4%), RSV B (11.7%), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (9.8%). In comparison, influenza virus A (IFA) had the highest isolation rate (28.5%), followed by hRV (15.5%), influenza virus B (IFB) (15.0%), and hMPV (14.0%), in adults (763 total patients). Multiple viruses were detected in single specimens from 22.4% of children and 2.0% of adults. IFA/IFB, RSV A/B, and hMPV exhibited strong seasonal detection and similar circulating patterns in children and adults. Adult patients showed different clinical manifestations according to causative viruses; nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were more common in hRV and human coronavirus (hCoV) infection. Patients with RSV B, hRV, or AdV tended to be younger, and those infected with RSV A and hMPV were likely to be older. Those with RSV A infection tended to stay longer in hospital, enter the intensive care unit more frequently, and have a fatal outcome more often. The bacterial co-detection rate was 26.5%, and those cases were more likely to have lower respiratory tract involvement (P = 0.001), longer hospital stay (P = 0.001), and higher mortality (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The etiologic virus of an acute respiratory infection can be cautiously inferred based on a patient\u0027s age and clinical features and concurrent epidemic data. Large-scale prospective surveillance studies are required to provide more accurate information about respiratory viral infection etiology, which could favorably influence clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2014-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Yu Bin; Song, Joon Young; Choi, Min Ju; Kim, In Seon; Yang, Tea Un; Hong, Kyung-Wook; Cheong, Hee Jin; Kim, Woo Joo","journal":"Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4091371.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2014.46.2.67; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25024868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV B","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV B","adults","acute respiratory infection","respiratory viral infection etiologies","respiratory viral infection etiology","children","hRV","hMPV","respiratory syncytial virus","clinical profiles of acute respiratory viral infections","influenza virus B","clinical features of common viral infections","common viruses","clinical outcomes","total patients","etiologic virus","Adult patients","different clinical manifestations","lower respiratory tract involvement","causative viruses","Multiple viruses","IFA","human coronavirus","human rhinovirus","human metapneumovirus","IFB","longer hospital","AdV","single specimens","bacterial co-detection rate","strong seasonal detection","highest isolation rate","similar circulating patterns","rhinorrhea","nasal congestion","retrospective observational study","accurate information","concurrent epidemic data","patient\u0027s age","METHODS","university-affiliated center","hCoV","Large-scale prospective surveillance studies","MATERIALS","intensive care unit","BACKGROUND","comparison","higher mortality","preventive","therapeutic strategies","cases","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","fatal outcome","adenovirus"],"language":"en"},

IBV is among the most important pathogens in chickens, and it spreads rapidly among flocks. In addition to dozens of known serotypes, new viral variants have emerged due to the viral evolution and antigenic variation in IBVs. Therefore, the development of a sensitive, specific, and easily performed assay is crucial for the rapid detection and surveillance of IBV infections. A rapid and simple immunochromatographic strip (ICS) was developed in this study by employing monoclonal antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins of IBV as the tracer and the capture antibody. The ICS showed high specificity in detecting IBV antigens, including several IBV genotypes and novel variants, as opposed to three other common avian respiratory viruses. The detection limit of the strip reached 10(4.4) 50% embryo-infective dose. Moreover, in the experimental chicken model, the strip test demonstrated consistency in detecting IBV with RT-PCR gene detection. Taken together, this antigen detection strip has the potential to serve as an on-farm rapid test for IBV; therefore, it may facilitate surveillance and control of the disease.","publish_time":"2019-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, I-Li; Lin, Yi-Chun; Lin, Yong-Chong; Jian, Cai-Zhen; Cheng, Ivan-Chen; Chen, Hui-Wen","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f81e9eb1b488b5a21f7bfbe5ece67dbd80425f86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6540333.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20092216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31064083/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","ICS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV antigens","IBV genotypes","surveillance of IBV infections","rapid detection","nucleocapsid proteins of IBV","strip test","antigen detection strip","detection limit","farm rapid test","ICS","simple immunochromatographic strip","RT-PCR gene detection","new viral variants","viral evolution","novel variants","Avian infectious bronchitis virus","common avian respiratory viruses","spike","considerable economic losses","dozens of known serotypes","poultry industry","monoclonal antibodies","tracer","consistency","experimental chicken model","antigenic variation","IBVs","study","assay","high specificity","addition","important pathogens","potential","capture antibody","embryo-infective dose","development","chickens","Taiwan","control","disease","flocks"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity. In this study, antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains showed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had higher inhibition to virus than the susceptible strain (P50). Subsequently, the label-free quantitative proteomics was used to study the midgut digestive juice response to BmNPV infection in P50 and A35 strains. A total of 98 proteins were identified, of which 80 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins by comparing the proteomes of infected and non-infected P50 and A35 silkworms. These DEPs are mainly involved in metabolism, proteolysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism and glutathione metabolism. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, 9 DEPs were identified potentially involved in resistance to BmNPV. Further studies showed that a serine protease, an alkaline phosphatase and serine protease inhibitor 2 isoform X1 were differentially expressed in A35 compared to P50 or post BmNPV infection. Taken together, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms for silkworm digestive juice to provide resistance to BmNPV infection. Signifcance: Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is highly pathogenic, which has a great impact on the sericulture. BmNPV entered the midgut lumen and exposed to digestive juices after oral infection. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity, however, current information on the digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain after BmNPV challenge compared to susceptible strain is incomprehensive. Here, we combined label-free quantification method, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis and found that BmNPV infection causes some protein changes in the silkworm midgut digestive juice. The DEPs were identified in the digestive juices of different resistant strains following BmNPV infection, and screened out some proteins potentially related to resistance to BmNPV. Three important differentially expression proteins were validated by independent approaches. These findings uncover the potential role of silkworm digestive juice in providing resistance to BmNPV and supplemented the profile of the proteome of the digestive juices in B. mori.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Shang-zhi; Wang, Jie; Zhu, Lin-bao; Toufeeq, Shahzad; Xu, Xin; You, Ling-ling; Li, Bing; Hu, Pei; Xu, Jia-ping","journal":"J Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39a3c99814a041252c86cfcf914e729429f46ffb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610263/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391919302994; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2019.103527; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874391919302994","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["BmNPV"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["silkworm midgut digestive juice","BmNPV challenge","post BmNPV infection","midgut digestive juice response","potential role of silkworm digestive juice","digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain","digestive juices of different resistant strains","expression proteins","nonenzymatic proteins","resistance","DEPs","A35 strains","oral infection","susceptible strain","antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains","individual immune stress response proteins","A35 silkworms","Previous studies","non-infected P50","Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus","sucrose metabolism","glutathione metabolism","midgut lumen","study","serine protease inhibitor","proteomes of infected","potential mechanisms","label-free quantification method","label-free quantitative proteomics","starch","RT-qPCR","bioinformatics","neuroactive ligand receptor interaction","alkaline phosphatase","protein changes","western blot analysis","higher inhibition","current information","genetic background","major pathogen","isoform X1","proteolysis","severe economic loss","insights","Signifcance","enzymes","profile","great impact","results","independent approaches","findings","sericulture","total"],"language":"en"},

Over the past decade, new knowledge has substantially enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis, outcome and natural history of AECOPD. The exacerbations not only greatly reduce the quality of life of these patients, but also result in hospitalization, respiratory failure, and death. The exacerbations are the major cost drivers in consumption of healthcare resources by COPD patients. Although bacterial infections are the most common etiologic agents, the role of viruses in COPD exacerbations is being increasingly recognized. The efficacy of antimicrobial therapy in acute exacerbations has established a causative role for bacterial infections. Recent molecular typing of sputum isolates further supports the role of bacteria in AECOPD. Isolation of a new strain of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae was associated with a considerable risk of an exacerbation. Lower airway bacterial colonization in stable patients with COPD instigates airway inflammation, which leads to a protracted self-perpetuating vicious circle of progressive lung damage and disease progression. A significant proportion of patients treated for COPD exacerbation demonstrate incomplete recovery, and frequent exacerbations contribute to decline in lung function. The predictors of poor outcome include advanced age, significant impairment of lung function, poor performance status, comorbid conditions and history of previous frequent exacerbations requiring antibacterials or systemic corticosteroids. These high-risk patients, who are likely to harbor organisms resistant to commonly used antimicrobials, should be identified and treated with antimicrobials with a low potential for failure. An aggressive management approach in complicated exacerbations may reduce costs by reducing healthcare utilization and hospitalization.","publish_time":"2012-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Sat; Anthonisen, Nicholas","journal":"Treat Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a46f62620d8446cbca1961358ecb328a2d5bfde.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD exacerbations","complicated exacerbations","COPD patients","history of previous frequent exacerbations","stable patients","high-risk patients","Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","significant proportion of patients","natural history of AECOPD","bacterial infections","significant impairment of lung function","role of viruses","causative role","disease progression","role of bacteria","hospitalization","Lower airway bacterial colonization","predictors of poor outcome","healthcare utilization","airway inflammation","common occurrence","new knowledge","used antimicrobials","respiratory failure","poor performance status","consumption of healthcare resources","common etiologic agents","protracted self-perpetuating vicious circle of progressive lung damage","new strain of Haemophilus influenzae","comorbid conditions","advanced age","Moraxella catarrhalis","costs","antibacterials","major cost drivers","incomplete recovery","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Recent molecular typing of sputum isolates","systemic corticosteroids","aggressive management approach","organisms resistant","understanding","efficacy of antimicrobial therapy","pathogenesis","considerable risk","past decade","Isolation","low potential","death","quality of life"],"language":"en"},

These may vary from asymptomatic infection to severe debilitating illness. Viruses enter the host cells to replicate, using host synthetic mechanisms, and, thus, are resistant to conventional antibiotics. The human body responds to viral infection by synthesising specific antibody which can be used to aid diagnosis. Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) commonly affects the 15 to 30 years age group. It may produce severe debility which may last a month or more. Coxsackie virus infection can produce symptoms of the common cold but may also invade heart muscle and produce myocarditis, a potentially serious disease. Other viruses also produce a wide spectrum of disease. Recent evidence has shown that people undergoing severe mental or physical stress may have reduced immunity to viral infections. There are risks associated with strenuous physical activity during the acute phase of viral infection, and there are reports of sudden death and serious complications occurring in previously fit young adults who undertake vigorous exercise when in the acute phase of a viral illness. Abnormalities of skeletal muscle have been demonstrated in patients with viral infection and this may explain the loss of performance experienced by athletes after upper respiratory tract infection. As a general rule, for all but mild common colds, it is advised that the athlete avoids hard training for the first month after infection.","publish_time":"2012-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roberts, J.

They do not spread to other areas of the body, and they usually do not pose a serious health risk. In fact, in most cases, benign liver tumors are not diagnosed because patients are asymptomatic. When they are detected, it\u2019s usually because the person has had medical imaging tests, such as an ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for another condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the literature was made using cancer literature and the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS) database for the following keywords: \u201Chepatic benign tumors\u201D, \u201Chepatic cystic tumors\u201D, \u201Cpolycystic liver disease\u201D, \u201Cliver macroregenerative nodules\u201D, \u201Chepatic mesenchymal hamartoma\u201D, \u201Chepatic angiomyolipoma\u201D, \u201Cbiliary cystadenoma\u201D, and \u201Cnodular regenerative hyperplasia\u201D. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in some areas of the world; there is an increasing incidence worldwide. Approximately 750,000 new cases are reported per year. More than 75 % of cases occur in the Asia-Pacific region, largely in association with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The incidence of HCC is increasing in the USA and Europe because of the increased incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Unlike the liver HCC, benign tumors are less frequent. However, they represent a chapter always more interesting of liver disease. In fact, a careful differential diagnosis with the forms of malignant tumor is often required in such a way so as to direct the patient to the correct therapy. In conclusion, many of these tumors present with typical features in various imaging studies. On occasions, biopsies are required, and/or surgical removal is needed. In the majority of cases of benign hepatic tumors, no treatment is indicated. The main indication for treatment is the presence of significant clinical symptoms or suspicion of malignancy or fear of malignant transformation.","publish_time":"2014-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bertino, Gaetano; Ardiri, Annalisa; Demma, Shirin; GiuseppeCalvagno, Stefano; Toro, Adriana; Basile, Elisa; Campagna, Davide; Ferraro, Giorgia; Frazzetto, Evelise; Proiti, Maria; Malaguarnera, Giulia; Bertino, Nicoletta; Malaguarnera, Mariano; Malaguarnera, Michele; Amaradio, Maria Domenica; Pricoco, Gabriele; Di Carlo, Isidoro","journal":"J Gastrointest Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2372ad555431eed74cb572d7025d34b938b70fff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCC"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Benign liver tumors","hepatic benign tumors","benign hepatic tumors","hepatic cystic tumors","tumors present","liver HCC","common malignant tumors","hepatic angiomyolipoma","polycystic liver disease","interesting of liver disease","incidence of HCC","liver macroregenerative nodules","majority of cases","new cases","increasing incidence","hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma","infection","treatment","CONCLUSION","fact","areas","increased incidence of hepatitis C virus","magnetic resonance imaging","various imaging studies","medical imaging tests","forms of malignant tumor","fear of malignant transformation","chronic hepatitis B virus","cancer literature","suspicion of malignancy","presence of significant clinical symptoms","scan","association","typical features","following keywords","computed tomography","WOS","database","Scopus","ultrasound","careful differential diagnosis","HBV","HCV","Web of Science","biliary cystadenoma","PubMed","MRI","Hepatocellular carcinoma","Europe","USA","world","BACKGROUND","Asia-Pacific region","nodular regenerative hyperplasia","METHODS","search","DISCUSSION","main indication","person","chapter","patients","serious health risk","correct therapy","MATERIALS","year","occasions","biopsies","surgical removal","way","condition","body"],"language":"en"},

Body mass index was 26 (24\u201335), 24% were overweight and 29% obese. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1 (0\u20132) and all but one patient had comorbid conditions. The median time between onset of the first symptom and admission to the ICU was 5 days (range 0\u201314). None of the patients had received vaccination against H1N1v. Nine patients received oseltamivir, only two of them within 48 hours of symptom onset. All patients developed severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)-Ratio 60 (55\u201392); lung injury score 3.8 (3.3\u20134.0)), were mechanically ventilated and on vasopressor support. Fourteen patients received corticosteroids, 7 patients underwent hemofiltration, and 10 patients needed extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO; 8 patients veno-venous, 2 patients veno-arterial), three patients Interventional Lung Assist (ILA) and two patients pump driven extracorporeal low-flow CO(2)-elimination (ECCO(2)\u2013R). Seven of 17 patients (41%) died in the ICU (4 patients due to bleeding, 3 patients due to multi-organ failure), while all other patients survived the hospital (59%). ECMO mortality was 50%.

The ICU survival tended to be higher in control patients (79 vs. 59%; p = 0.06). Patients with H1N1v admitted to either of our ICUs were young, overproportionally obese and almost all with existing comorbidities. All patients developed severe ARDS, which could only be treated with extracorporeal gas exchange in an unexpectedly high proportion. Patients with H1N1v had more complicated courses compared to control patients.","publish_time":"2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schellongowski, Peter; Ullrich, Roman; Hieber, Cornelia; Hetz, Hubert; Losert, Heidrun; Hermann, Maria; Hermann, Alexander; Gattringer, Klaus-Bernhard; Siersch, Viktoria; Rabitsch, Werner; Fuhrmann, Valentin; Bojic, Andja; Robak, Oliver; Sperr, Wolfgang R.; Laczika, Klaus; Locker, Gottfried J.; Staudinger, Thomas","journal":"Wien Klin Wochenschr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2492d9416420c3c9793938f8df8976b7d59efe23.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Adult Respiratory Distress","ICU","ARDS","Interventional Lung Assist","CO","ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control patients","patients veno-arterial","patients veno-venous","patients Interventional Lung Assist","adult intensive care unit patients","H1N1v","days","median ICU length","ICU survival","control group","ventilator","median time","severe ARDS","ECMO mortality","ECMO duration","stay","extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation","extracorporeal gas exchange","hours of symptom onset","driven extracorporeal low-flow","lung injury score","Body mass index","Charlson Comorbidity Index","Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome","complicated courses","rate of mechanical ventilation","ICUs","TISS","PaO","scores","nonsurvivors","admission","influenza","hemofiltration","bleeding","multi-organ failure","high proportion","age","IQR","corticosteroids","existing comorbidities","ECCO","comorbid conditions","years","FiO","elimination","range","vaccination","vasopressor support","SAPS","hospital","oseltamivir"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a tertiary care institute of North India, from June 2012 through March 2014, who received mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h. All enrolled children were assessed daily for development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) using the case definition given by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chest radiograph and microbiologic samplings were performed in children suspected to have VAP. Risk factors associated with VAP were calculated by doing bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were screened and 86 were enrolled (median age 30 mo 95% CI 4.0\u201384.0; 72% boys). The most common admitting diagnosis was sepsis (16%) followed by acyanotic congenital heart disease with pneumonia (14%) and the most common indication for ventilation was respiratory failure (45.3%). The incidence of VAP according to CDC criteria was 38.4%, while the incidence of microbiologically confirmed VAP was 24.4%. The incidence of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was found to be 11.6%. Acinetobacter was the most frequently isolated organism (47%) followed by Pseudomonas (28%), Klebsiella (15%), E. coli (5%) and Enterobacter (5%). Risk factors for VAP on bivariate analysis were use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (p = 0.027, OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.1\u201324.3), enteral feeding (p \u003C 0.001, OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.1\u201319.4) and re-intubation (p = 0.024, OR 3.3 and 95% CI 1.1\u20139.6). On multivariate analysis, use of PPI (p = 0.03, OR 8.47, 95% CI 1.19\u201360.33) and enteral feeding (p \u003C 0.001, OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.58\u201357.78) were identified as independent risk factors for VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator associated pneumonia is an important complication in children receiving mechanical ventilation in PICU and Gram negative bacilli (Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas) being the important causative agents. Ventilator associated tracheobronchitis is an emerging entity; recognition and treatment of same might prevent the development of VAP.

Somatic, psychic and spiritual needs of these patients may differ from those of patients suffering from incurable solid tumours and are not comprehensively evaluated so far. METHODS: To address this question, data from charts of 123 patients who have died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were extracted. In detail, the time line of the clinical course, the symptoms, the administered drugs and other applied procedures were analysed. RESULTS: Approximately one half of the patients, who have died after stem cell transplantation, did not live more than 5 months. Two-thirds of patients died within 14 months after SCT. 28.5% of the patients could not be discharged after transplantation. However, a significant proportion had a low ECOG-score (0\u20131) prior to death, indicating a high degree of mobility. Major symptoms were weakness, fatigue and need for aid at daily activities. Severe pain, dyspnoea and obstipation, as known from patients suffering from advanced solid tumours, were rare. In consequence, use of opioids seemed to be less frequent than in patients with solid tumours. Measures of intensive care and i.v.-drug administration were applied to a significant proportion of patients. CONCLUSION: The present investigation indicates that the somatic, psychic and spiritual end-of-life-care after allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be optimised. A significant problem for the transplantation team seems to be the realisation of necessity to switch the curative concept into a palliative ambition. Requirements are a subsequent prospectively conducted investigation and an intensification of cooperation between transplant and palliative care teams.","publish_time":"2017-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busemann, Christoph; J\u00FClich, Andreas; Buchhold, Britta; Schmidt, Vanessa; Schneidewind, Laila; Pink, Daniel; Schmidt, Christian Andreas; Neumann, Thomas; Kr\u00FCger, William H.","journal":"J Cancer Res Clin Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6dbaab53f243b1a8d9ea07ff7f2b00d24331b1f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101727.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thirds of patients","significant proportion of patients","Allogeneic stem cell transplantation","transplantation team","life-care","palliative care teams","significant problem","advanced solid tumours","incurable solid tumours","high-quality palliative care medicine","end of life","spiritual end","Measures of intensive care","palliative ambition","half","months","spiritual needs","present investigation","Major symptoms","applied procedures","intensification of cooperation","fatigue","clinical course","curative concept","administered drugs","drug administration","aid","weakness","obstipation","PURPOSE","low ECOG-score","realisation of necessity","question","Severe pain","dyspnoea","time line","data","charts","high degree of mobility","daily activities","death","opioids","Requirements","CONCLUSION","SCT","consequence","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 patients underwent (99m)Tc-DTPA inhalation lung scintigraphy. Six region of interest (ROI) patterns were adopted: ROI 1 was outlined around the entire hemithorax, and ROIs 2\u20136 were outlined around the hemithorax but excluded square ROIs of different size in the hilar region. Half-times (T(\u00BD)) were calculated with time-activity curves using onecompartment and two-compartment analyses. The T(\u00BD) of ROIs 1\u20135 were plotted against the T(\u00BD) of ROI 6, and regression lines were obtained with the least-squares method. The absolute values of the differences between surveyed values and regression line were calculated.

We found that the lungs had the higher viral load than the spleen, whereas no detectable viruses in tissues of heart, liver, kidney, large intestine, small intestine, or brain. Specifically, the viral load was higher in the left lung (7.1 log10 copies per ml) in relation to the right lung (5.7 log10 copies per ml), resulting in more severe pathological damage in the left lung, and lung tissues contained both positive- and negative-stranded viral RNA. However, there existed a low level of H5N1 viruses in the spleen (3.8 log10 copies per ml), with the absence of positive-stranded viral RNA. Our results indicate that replication of H5N1 viruses mainly occurs in the lungs, and the degree of lung damage is highly correlated with the viral load in the lungs.

Artificial transcription factors are a potentially powerful molecular strategy for improving cellulase production in T. reesei. In this study, enhanced transcriptional activators XYR1VP, ACE2VP, and ACE1VP were constructed by linking the C terminus of XYR1, ACE2, or ACE1 with an activation domain of herpes simplex virus protein VP16. T. reesei transformants T(XYR1VP), T(ACE2VP), and T(ACE1VP) showed improved cellulase and/or xylanase production. T(XYR1VP) has a cellulase-free phenotype but with significantly elevated xylanase production. Xylanase I and xylanase II activities [U/(mg biomass)] increased by 51% and 80%, respectively, in T(XYR1VP) in comparison with parental strain RUT C30. The filter paper activity of T(ACE2VP) in the Avicel-based medium increased by 52% compared to that of RUT C30. In the Avicel-based medium, T(ACE1VP) manifested an 80% increase in FPase activity and a 50% increase in xylanase activity as compared to those of RUT C30. Additionally, when pretreated corn stover was hydrolyzed, crude enzymes produced from T(ACE1VP) yielded a greater glucose release than did the enzymes produced by parental strain RUT C30.

However, what inflammation-related response of the host for H7N9 influenza A virus infection to survival from injures of exuberant cytokine release is still obscure. In this research, expression pattern and histological distribution of inflammation-related genes, RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, Slit2 and Robo4 in the lung of BALB/c mice infected with two H7N9 IAV strains with only a PB2 residue 627 difference were investigated, as well as the histopathological injury of the lung. Results showed that significantly higher expression level of NLRP3, RIP3, IL-1\u03B2 and TNF-\u03B1 in H7N9-infected groups compared with the control would play a key role in driving lung pathological lesion. While the expression level of Slit2 and Robo4 in H7N9 rV(K627E) group had significantly increased trend than V(K627) which might be the main factor to inhibit the interstitial pneumonia and infiltration. Also, H7N9 induced the histopathological changes in the lung of infected mice, and RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, Slit2 and Robo4 showed cell-specific distribution in the lung.

METHODS: Data from 735 patients undergoing primary liver resection for HCC between 2002 and 2014 were analyzed. Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the RD group, defined by a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate of \u003C45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the non-RD group. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients had RD. The incidence of postoperative pleural effusion (24 vs. 11%; P = 0.007) and major complications (Clavien\u2013Dindo III\u2013V; 31 vs. 15%; P = 0.003) were significantly higher in RD patients. In RD patients with Child-Pugh A, 90-day mortality rate (1.9%) and median survival time (6.11 years) were comparable to that of non-RD patients.

All children suffered from sepsis based on international criteria (fever, tachycardia, respiratory rate \u003E2 SD above normal in the context of a suspected or proven infection). In ten children bacteria were isolated, in six children a fungal infection was diagnosed and four sepsis episodes were caused by viral infections. GTX contained a median neutrophil number of 6.3 (range 1.9\u201313.9)\u00D710(10) per transfusion and obtained a sustained haematological response after GTX. Nineteen out of 32 children survived the neutropenic sepsis, particularly nine out of 11 patients with bacterial sepsis. DISCUSSION: In contrast to the non-survivors, we observed a significant decrease in the C-reactive protein levels shortly after initiation of the GTX treatment in the surviving patients. A clear-cut benefit of GTX for children with neutropenic sepsis cannot be concluded from these data, but in children with (severe) bacterial sepsis refractory to antibiotic treatment, GTX were feasible, safe and could reduce mortality rates in this subgroup of patients.","publish_time":"2006-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grigull, Lorenz; Pulver, Nicole; Goudeva, Lilia; Sykora, Karl-Walter; Linderkamp, Christin; Beilken, Andreas; Seidemann, Kathrin; Schmid, Hansj\u00F6rg; Welte, Karl; Heuft, Hans-Gert","journal":"Support Care Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e09de8e5ab919215ae9efba0e36c461619be286e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102011.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102011/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chugai Pharma","GTX"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["neutropenic sepsis","GTX treatment","children bacteria","sepsis episodes","subgroup of patients","surviving patients","bacterial sepsis refractory","neutropenic paediatric patients","clear-cut benefit of GTX","range","median neutrophil number","antibiotic treatment","neutrophil mobilization","fungal infection","proven infection","median age","single subcutaneous dose of glycosylated G-CSF","effect of granulocyte colony","stimulated granulocyte transfusions","cytomegalic-antibody compatible donors","tachycardia","Chugai Pharma","Lenograstim","fever","respiratory rate","observational study","C-reactive protein levels","significant decrease","Japan","SD","context","factor","initiation","international criteria","mortality rates","underlying diseases","non-survivors","ABO group","retrospective","allogeneic stem cell transplantation","Granulocytes","neutropenia","sustained haematological response","haematooncological malignancies","oral dexamethasone","contrast","METHODS","viral infections","DISCUSSION","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","data","total","years"],"language":"en"},

Clinical characteristics, blood tests and neuroimaging were compared among groups. Associations between EEG patterns and structural and non-structural abnormalities were calculated. Glasgow Outcome Score \u003E3 at discharge was defined as favorable and 1\u20133 as unfavorable outcome. In multivariable analyses, theta was associated with brain atrophy (OR 2.6, p = 0.020), theta/delta with intracerebral hemorrhages (OR 6.8, p = 0.005), FIRDA with past cerebrovascular accidents (OR 2.7, p = 0.004), TWs with liver or multi-organ failure (OR 6, p = 0.004; OR 4, p = 0.039), and delta activity with alcohol/drug abuse with or without intoxication, and HIV infection (OR 3.8, p = 0.003; OR 9, p = 0.004).

In encephalopathic patients, well-defined EEG patterns are associated with specific pathological conditions and outcomes, suggesting that mechanistic hypotheses underlie these abnormal EEG patterns.

The increasing incidence of infections caused by these viruses worldwide has necessitated focused attention to improve both diagnostic as well as treatment modalities. In this second part of a two-part review, we discuss the clinical features, diagnostic modalities, and treatment of zoonotic influenza, and provide an overview of prevention strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Illnesses caused by novel reassortant avian influenza viruses continue to be detected and described; most recently, a human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) has been described from China. We continue to witness increasing rates of A(H7N9) infections, with the latest (fifth) wave, from late 2016 to 2017, being the largest to date. The case fatality rate for A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) infections among humans is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections. Since the emergence of the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic, and subsequently A(H7N9), testing and surveillance for novel influenzas have become more effective. Various newer treatment options, including peramivir, favipiravir (T-705), and DAS181, and human or murine monoclonal antibodies have been evaluated in vitro and in animal models. SUMMARY: Armed with robust diagnostic modalities, antiviral medications, vaccines, and advanced surveillance systems, we are today better prepared to face a new influenza pandemic and to limit the burden of zoonotic influenza than ever before. Sustained efforts and robust research are necessary to efficiently deal with the highly mutagenic zoonotic influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, K.; Goneau, L.

Viral load was measured by real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) value on upper respiratory tract samples. Its value was categorized into three groups (low Ct, \u2264 20; intermediate Ct, \u003E 20\u201330; and high Ct, \u003E 30). Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was isolated in 207 cases (86.6%). The mean Ct value was 26.69 \u00B1 5.81.

A local paracrine brain RAS has been associated with several brain disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Classically, angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main RAS effector peptide and acts through two major receptors: Ang II type 1 and 2 (AT1 and AT2) receptors. It has been shown that enhanced activation of the Ang II/AT1 axis exacerbates dopaminergic cell death. Several new components of the RAS have more recently been discovered. However, the role of new Ang 1-7/Mas receptor RAS component was not investigated in the brain and particularly in the dopaminergic system. In the present study, we observed Mas receptor labeling in dopaminergic neurons and glial cells in rat mesencephalic primary cultures; substantia nigra of rats, monkeys, and humans; and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from healthy controls and sporadic PD patients. The present data support a neuroprotective role of the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis in the dopaminergic system. We observed that this axis is downregulated with aging, which may contribute to the aging-related vulnerability to neurodegeneration.

It is recognized by the signs of acute- or subacute-onset cough, hemoptysis, diffuse radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and hypoxemic respiratory distress. DAH is characterized by the accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells originating most frequently from the alveolar capillaries. It must be distinguished from localized pulmonary hemorrhage, which is most commonly due to chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tumor, or localized infection. Hemoptysis, the major sign of DAH, may develop suddenly or over a period of days to weeks; this sign may also be initially absent, in which case diagnostic suspicion is established after sequential bronchoalveolar lavage reveals worsening red blood cell counts. The causes of DAH can be divided into infectious and noninfectious, the latter of which may affect immunocompetent or immunodeficient patients. Pulmonary infections are rarely reported in association with DAH, but they should be considered in the diagnostic workup because of the obvious therapeutic implications. In immunocompromised patients, the main infectious diseases that cause DAH are cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, invasive aspergillosis, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Strongyloides. In immunocompetent patients, the infectious diseases that most frequently cause DAH are influenza A (H1N1), dengue, leptospirosis, malaria, and Staphylococcus aureus infection. Based on a search of the PubMed and Scopus databases, we review the infectious diseases that may cause DAH in immunocompetent patients.","publish_time":"2012-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"von Ranke, Felipe Mussi; Zanetti, Gl\u00E1ucia; Hochhegger, Bruno; Marchiori, Edson","journal":"Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd41591f91d828c8c84deceaed633d1dc6cb5a9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["causes of DAH","major sign of DAH","immunocompetent patients","main infectious diseases","immunocompromised patients","immunodeficient patients","Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage","localized pulmonary hemorrhage","hemoptysis","Pulmonary infections","localized infection","alveolar capillaries","diffuse radiographic pulmonary infiltrates","accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells","red blood cell counts","diagnostic workup","case diagnostic suspicion","Staphylococcus aureus infection","anemia","sequential bronchoalveolar lavage","subacute-onset cough","cytomegalovirus","invasive aspergillosis","leptospirosis","Mycoplasma","malaria","bronchiectasis","tumor","adenovirus","Scopus databases","dengue","Legionella","hypoxemic respiratory distress","obvious therapeutic implications","H1N1","syndrome","clinical conditions","search","PubMed","chronic bronchitis","signs of acute","weeks","influenza","association","period of days","prompt treatment","Strongyloides"],"language":"en"},

This H7N9 virus appeared to infect humans with greater ease than previous avian influenza virus subtypes such as H5N1 and H9N2. While there are other potential explanations for this large number of human infections with an avian influenza virus, we investigated whether a lack of conserved T-cell epitopes between endemic H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and the novel H7N9 virus contributes to this observation. Here we demonstrate that a number of T cell epitopes are conserved between endemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and H7N9 virus. Most of these conserved epitopes are from viral internal proteins. The extent of conservation between endemic human seasonal influenza and avian influenza H7N9 was comparable to that with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. Thus, the ease of inter-species transmission of H7N9 viruses (compared with avian H5N1 viruses) cannot be attributed to the lack of conservation of such T cell epitopes. On the contrary, our findings predict significant T-cell based cross-reactions in the human population to the novel H7N9 virus. Our findings also have implications for H7N9 virus vaccine design.","publish_time":"2014-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Huawei; Yen, Hui-Ling; Liu, Yinping; Lau, Yu-Lung; Malik Peiris, J.

Within the Coronaviridae family, two separate methytransferases (MTase), nsp14 and nsp16, perform the RNA-cap N7-guanine and 2\u2032-OH methylation respectively for generation of the proposed m7GpppNm type I cap structure.

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. SETTING: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. LIMITATION: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. CONCLUSION: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

Here, we found that MAVS, critical for the host RNA sensing pathway upstream of IFN induction, is degraded by the RV RNA methyl- and guanylyl-transferase (VP3) in a host-range-restricted manner. Mechanistically, VP3 localizes to the mitochondria and mediates the phosphorylation of a previously unidentified SPLTSS motif within the MAVS proline-rich region, leading to its proteasomal degradation and blockade of IFN-\u03BB production in RV-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Importantly, VP3 inhibition of MAVS activity contributes to enhanced RV replication and to viral pathogenesis in vivo.

The mechanism of organ tropism and innate immune evasion of DPV has not been completely deciphered due to a lack of cell models to study the innate immune manipulation and pathogenicity of aquatic viruses. In the present study, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using tropism infection and innate immunologic assays. Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs. DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible. The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in DEFs and astrocytes. Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages. The titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes. The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV strain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes. The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition and activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively. Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain. Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain. The selection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations. Our study provided practical methods for isolating and culturing duck primary cells, and our results will facilitate further investigations of organ tropism, innate immune responses, latent infection, and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating DPV and potentially other aerial bird pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Bin; Cai, Dongjie; He, Tianqiong; Deng, Liyao; Wu, Liping; Wang, Mingshu; Jia, Renyong; Zhu, Dekang; Liu, Mafeng; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Zhao, Xinxin; Chen, Shun; Zhang, Shaqiu; Huang, Juan; Ou, Xumin; Mao, Sai; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling; Liu, Yunya; Cheng, Anchun","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5503464f5c8ac4db987ce87b05f224a7aaafc1a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6999086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32063900/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.03131","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPV","EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DPV strain","DPV infection","macrophages","attenuated virus strain","astrocytes","innate immune evasion of DPV","innate immune manipulation","neurons","innate immune response","recombinant virulent strain","tropism infection","phenomenon of innate immune inhibition","infected DEFs","infected monocytes","induction of innate immunity","immune responses","innate immunologic assays","inhibited infection","Duck plague virus","latent infection","attenuated strains","types of duck primary cells","culturing duck primary cells","investigations of organ tropism","basal levels of innate immunity molecules","broad tropism","mechanism of organ tropism","duck embryo fibroblasts","genomic copy number","RNA virus analogs","appropriate cell models","PBMCs","lack of cell models","titer","present study","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","pathogenicity of aquatic viruses","Pre-activation of IFNAR","important cell model","aquatic animals","DNA viruses","Blockage of IFNAR","selection assay results","CHv-GFP","gross lesions","essential role","geese","stimulation","promoted replication","practical methods","representative pathogen","effectiveness of antiviral drugs","expression of EGFP","aerial bird pathogens","ducks"],"language":"en"},

Although the licensing of botanical drug Veregen approved by FDA has indicated the importance of quantitative analysis in quality control of herbal medicines, quantitative evaluation of a Chinese patent drug like SHL remains a challenge due to the complex chemical profile. In this study, 15 small molecular components of SHL (four flavonoids, six quinic acid derivatives, three saponins and two phenylethanoid glycosides) were simultaneously determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2013Q-TOF-MS). The contents of the three major saccharides, namely fructose, glucose and sucrose were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector on an amino column (HPLC-ELSD). The macromolecules were quantified by precipitating in 80% ethanol, drying the precipitate, and then weighing. The established methods were validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy and stability and then successfully applied to analyze 12 batches of commercial products of SHL produced by four different manufacturers. The results indicated that 57.52\u201378.11% (w/w) of SHL could be quantitatively determined (non-saccharide small molecules: 1.77\u20133.75%, monosaccharides: 0.93\u201320.93%, macromolecules: 2.63\u20135.76% and sucrose: 49.20\u201365.94%).

While the long fiber binds to the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor, the function of the short fiber in the virus life cycle is poorly understood. Here, we show, by glycan microarray analysis and cellular studies, that the short fiber knob (SFK) of HAdV-52 recognizes long chains of \u03B1-2,8-linked polysialic acid (polySia), a large posttranslational modification of selected carrier proteins, and that HAdV-52 can use polySia as a receptor on target cells. X-ray crystallography, NMR, molecular dynamics simulation, and structure-guided mutagenesis of the SFK reveal that the nonreducing, terminal sialic acid of polySia engages the protein with direct contacts, and that specificity for polySia is achieved through subtle, transient electrostatic interactions with additional sialic acid residues. In this study, we present a previously unrecognized role for polySia as a cellular receptor for a human viral pathogen.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled experimental study. ANIMALS: Eighteen female Himalayan rabbits, weight 2.1 \u00B1 0.1 kg. METHODS: Premedication with 0.1 mg kg(\u22121) medetomidine and 5 mg kg(\u22121) carprofen subcutaneously, was followed by intravenous anaesthetic induction with sufentanil (2.3 \u03BCg mL(\u22121)) and midazolam (0.45 mg mL(\u22121)). After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with sufentanil-midazolam (n = 9) or sevoflurane (n = 9). Ovariohysterectomy was performed. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was performed as required. Physiological variables were studied perioperatively. Group means of physiologic data were generated for different anaesthetic periods. Data were compared for changes from sedation, and between groups by anova. Post-operatively, 0.05 mg kg(\u22121) buprenorphine was administered once and 5 mg kg(\u22121) carprofen once daily for 2\u20133 days. Rabbits were examined and weighed daily until one week after surgery. RESULTS: Smooth induction of anaesthesia was achieved within 5 minutes. Sufentanil and midazolam doses were 0.5 \u03BCg kg(\u22121) and 0.1 mg kg(\u22121), during induction and 3.9 \u03BCg kg(\u22121) hour(\u22121) and 0.8 mg kg(\u22121) hour(\u22121) during surgery, respectively. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 2.1% during surgery. Assisted ventilation was required in nine rabbits receiving sufentanil-midazolam and four receiving sevoflurane. There were no differences between groups in physiologic data other than arterial carbon dioxide. In rabbits receiving sevoflurane, mean arterial pressure decreased pre-surgical intervention, heart rate increased 25% during and after surgery and body weight decreased 4% post-operatively. Post-operative problems sometimes resulted from catheterization of the ear artery. CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane and sufentanil-midazolam provided surgical anaesthesia of similar quality. Arterial blood pressure was sustained during sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia and rabbits receiving sevoflurane lost body weight following ovariohysterectomy. Mechanical ventilation was required with both anaesthetic regimens. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Anaesthesia with sufentanil-midazolam in medetomidine premedicated healthy rabbits is useful in the clinical and the research setting, as an alternative to sevoflurane.","publish_time":"2016-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedenqvist, Patricia; Jensen-Waern, Marianne; Fahlman, \u00C5sa; Hagman, Ragnvi; Edner, Anna","journal":"Vet Anaesth Analg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/120fdf24578441888a02e43eeee3e1a54661e3a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185500.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467298716302033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1467298716302033; https://doi.org/10.1111/vaa.12207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia","receiving sevoflurane","midazolam doses","healthy rabbits","medetomidine premedicated rabbits","surgery","physiological effects of sufentanil","Smooth induction of anaesthesia","arterial pressure","female Himalayan rabbits","\u03BCg","surgical anaesthesia of similar quality","End-tidal sevoflurane concentration","physiologic data","body weight","Arterial blood pressure","intravenous anaesthetic induction","groups","Intermittent positive pressure ventilation","anaesthetic regimens","Mechanical ventilation","Assisted ventilation","Ovariohysterectomy","hour","carprofen","pre-surgical intervention","arterial carbon dioxide","different anaesthetic periods","Post-operative problems","STUDY DESIGN","CLINICAL RELEVANCE","Physiological variables","randomized controlled experimental study","catheterization","heart rate","research setting","sedation","changes","ANIMALS","alternative","differences","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","endotracheal intubation","ear artery","anova","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","Premedication","week","minutes","buprenorphine","days"],"language":"en"},

While the majority of scrubs and lab coats are still made of the same traditional textiles used to make street clothes, new evidence suggests that current innovative textiles function as an engineering control, minimizing the acquisition, retention and transmission of infectious pathogens by reducing the levels of bioburden and microbial sustainability. This paper summarizes recent literature on the role of apparel worn in healthcare settings in the acquisition and transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens. It proposes solutions or technological interventions that can reduce the risk of transmission of micro-organisms that are associated with the healthcare environment.

To investigate the epidemiological and genetic variation of HBoV in Guangzhou, South China, we screened 3460 throat swab samples from 1686 children and 1774 adults with acute respiratory infection symptoms for HBoV between March 2010 and February 2011, and analyzed the complete genome sequence of 2 HBoV strains. Specimens were screened for HBoV by real-time PCR and other 6 common respiratory viruses by RT-PCR or PCR. HBoV was detected in 58 (1.68%) out of 3460 samples, mostly from pediatric patients (52/58) and inpatient children (47/58). Six adult patients were detected as HBoV positive and 5 were emergency cases. Of these HBoV positive cases, 19 (32.76%) had co-pathogens including influenza virus (n = 5), RSV (n = 5), parainfluenza (n = 4), adenovirus (n = 1), coronavirus (n = 7). The complete genome sequences of 2 HBoVs strains (Genbank no. JN794565 and JN794566) were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 2 HBoV strains were HBoV1, and were most genetically close to ST2 (GenBank accession number DQ0000496).

Given the importance of sand fly salivary proteins as potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in the last few decades. In this context, we previously immunized dogs with a vaccine composed of L. braziliensis antigens plus saponin as the adjuvant and sand fly salivary gland extract (LBSapSal vaccine). This vaccine elicited an increase in both anti-saliva and anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, higher counts of specific circulating CD8(\u002B) T cells, and high NO production. METHODS: We investigated the immunogenicity and protective effect of LBSapSal vaccination after intradermal challenge with 1 \u00D7 10(7) late-log-phase L. infantum promastigotes in the presence of sand fly saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis. The dogs were followed for up to 885 days after challenge. RESULTS: The LBSapSal vaccine presents extensive antigenic diversity with persistent humoral and cellular immune responses, indicating resistance against CVL is triggered by high levels of total IgG and its subtypes (IgG1 and IgG2); expansion of circulating CD5(\u002B), CD4(\u002B), and CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes and is Leishmania-specific; and reduction of splenic parasite load. CONCLUSIONS: These results encourage further study of vaccine strategies addressing Leishmania antigens in combination with proteins present in the saliva of the vector.","publish_time":"2014-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian de Oliveira; Roatt, Bruno Mendes; Ker, Henrique Gama; Moreira, N\u00E1dia das Dores; Mathias, Fernando Augusto Siqueira; Cardoso, Jamille Mirelle de Oliveira; Gontijo, Nelder Figueiredo; Bruna-Romero, Oscar; Teixeira-Carvalho, Andr\u00E9a; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Corr\u00EAa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e83f16bbbc37d4cf2eba3dd0479e4ec7da6fc41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3943450.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-61; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-Leishmania vaccine","LBSapSal vaccine","protective vaccine","Leishmania-specific","Leishmania antigens","anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes","anti-saliva","study of vaccine strategies","transmission of Leishmania parasites","domestic cycle of Leishmania infantum","salivary proteins","CVL","importance of sand","presence of sand fly saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis","RESULTS","protective effect of LBSapSal vaccination","higher counts of specific circulating CD8","proteins present","high levels of total IgG","braziliensis antigens","T cells","infantum promastigotes","T lymphocytes","intradermal challenge","immunized dogs","salivary gland extract","expansion of circulating CD5","extensive antigenic diversity","adjuvant","potent immunogens","cellular immune responses","combination","inclusion","canine visceral leishmaniasis","IgG2","IgG1","subtypes","resistance","immunogenicity","alternative approach","reduction of splenic parasite load","saponin","development","increase","log-phase","CD4","production","context","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","vector","METHODS","days","decades"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we show our lab tested solutions in two specific healthcare scenarios.

Worth-noting aspects such as possible EMI interferences, technology selection and management of RFID data from hospital information system are analyzed. Lab testing of system reliability based on passive UHF RFID is provided for this case. On the other hand, we analyze and provide a solution for care and control of patients in a hospital based on passive HF RFID with the result of a fully functional demonstrator. Our prototype squeezes RFID features in order to provide a backup data source from patient\u0027s wristband.

High-titres of CarMV, CRSV, CIRV, and CLV accumulated in all plant tissues whereas CERV and CVMV were irregularly distributed over the plant. High-titres of all viruses accumulated in leaf, petal, stamen, pistil, and ovary tissues, so leaves or petals are a good tissue for routine diagnosis. Six chemicals were evaluated for inactivation of all carnation viruses in infected extracts. Commercial bleach at 7% (v/v) or NaOH at 0.5% (w/v) was found to inactivate all viruses after 60s treatment in a systemic S. vaccaria bioassay.","publish_time":"2007-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00E1nchez-Navarro, Jes\u00FAs A.; Ca\u00F1izares, M.

This study is performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed by \u03C72 test or Fisher\u0027s exact tests as appropriate. Results: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients. The median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] years vs. 40 [33, 57] years, Z = 9.738, P \u003C 0.001). More patients in the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs. 41.5%, \u03C72 = 22.105, P \u003C 0.001).

The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17] \u00D7 109/L vs. 4.52 [3.62, 5.88] \u00D7 109/L, Z = 7.618, P \u003C 0.001). Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] \u00D7 109/L vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] \u00D7 109/L, Z = 8.037, P \u003C 0.001) and lymphocyte/WBC ratio (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.5 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z = 10.315, P \u003C 0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte/WBC ratio continue to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z = 5.242, P \u003C 0.001). Alanine transaminase (ALT) (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] U/L vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z = 2.592, P = 0.010), aspartate transaminase (AST) (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] U/L vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z = 7.308, P \u003C 0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] \u03BCmol/L vs.65.00 [54.60, 78.75] \u03BCmol/L, Z = 6.478, P \u003C 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group that those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] mg/L vs.3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P \u003C 0.001) showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.0, 170.28] mg/L vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z = 1.219, P = 0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (89.9% vs. 7.6%, \u03C72 = 148.105, P \u003C 0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.8%, \u03C72 = 93.222, P \u003C 0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0, \u03C72 = 23.257, P \u003C 0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0, \u03C72 = 14.618, P \u003C 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0, \u03C72 = 7.655, P = 0.006). Conclusions: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death groups had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.

Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S protein of six PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have S proteins with a size similar to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have in the S protein 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses. Four of the residues changed (aa 219 of NEB72 isolate and as 92, 94, and 218 of TOY56) are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may be involved in the receptor binding site (RBS) conferring enteric tropism to TGEVs. A second RBS used by the virus to infect ST cells might be located in a conserved area between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor virus which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BR170, and the PRCVs, in this order. Least squares estimation of the origin of TGEV-related coronaviruses showed a significant constancy in the fixation of mutations with time, that is, the existence of a well-defined molecular clock. A mutation fixation rate of 7 \u00B1 2 \u00D7 10\u22124 nucleotide substitutions per site and per year was calculated for TGEV-related viruses. This rate falls in the range reported for other RNA viruses. Point mutations and probably recombination events have occurred during TGEV evolution.","publish_time":"1992-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00E1nchez, Carlos M.; Gebauer, F\u00E1tima; Su\u00F1\u00E9, Carlos; Mendez, Ana; Dopazo, Joaqu\u00EDn; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229291195Z; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229291195Z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","RBS","ST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-related viruses","enteric viruses","TOY56 viruses","origin of TGEV","TGEV evolution","NEB72","RNA viruses","B of TGEV S glycoprotein","TGEV antigenic cluster","S proteins","enteric tropism","European PRCVs","respiratory tropism","related coronaviruses","main virus lineage","recent progenitor virus","antigenic sites C","Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses","Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","respiratory isolates","RBS","fixation of mutations","ST cells","time","receptor binding site","mutation fixation rate","specific amino acid differences","amino acids","identical deletion","conserved area","deleted area","evolutionary tree","deletion present","RNA sequences","monoclonal antibodies specific","significant constancy","size similar","PUR46","year","MIL65","existence","recombination events","BR170","secondary lineages","enteropathogenic coronavirus","well-defined molecular clock","nucleotide substitutions","genetic relationship","squares estimation","TGEVs","range","position","residues","order"],"language":"en"},

They include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), many of which seriously endanger human health and well-being. Only alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses harbor nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), which performs multiple functions in inhibiting antiviral host responses. The role of the C terminus of betacoronavirus nsp1 in virulence has been characterized, but the location of the alphacoronavirus nsp1 region that is important for virulence remains unclear. Here, using TGEV nsp1 as a model to explore the function of this protein in alphacoronaviruses, we demonstrate that alphacoronavirus nsp1 inhibits host gene expression. Solving the crystal structure of full-length TGEV at 1.85-\u00C5 resolution and conducting several biochemical analyses, we observed that a specific motif (amino acids 91\u201395) of alphacoronavirus nsp1 is a conserved region that inhibits host protein synthesis. Using a reverse-genetics system based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology to construct a recombinant TGEV in which this specific nsp1 motif was altered, we found that this mutation does not affect virus replication in cell culture but significantly reduces TGEV pathogenicity in pigs. Taken together, our findings suggest that alphacoronavirus nsp1 is an essential virulence determinant, providing a potential paradigm for the development of a new attenuated vaccine based on modified nsp1.","publish_time":"2019-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Zhou; Wang, Gang; Yang, Yiling; Shi, Jiale; Fang, Liurong; Li, Fang; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F.; Peng, Guiqing","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/732e5a24c5fba998f6618e5f670c56b35d16084e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6746460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350335/; http://www.jbc.org/content/294/37/13606.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.009713","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["TGEV nsp1","alphacoronavirus nsp1 region","modified nsp1","specific nsp1 motif","recombinant TGEV","TGEV pathogenicity","C terminus of betacoronavirus nsp1","host protein synthesis","virus replication","crystal structure of full-length TGEV","nonstructural protein","specific motif","alphacoronaviruses","human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","essential virulence determinant","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","antiviral host responses","host gene expression","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","conserved region","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","human health","PEDV","Cas9 technology","new attenuated vaccine","CRISPR","development","potential paradigm","\u00C5 resolution","cell culture","multiple functions","reverse-genetics system","betacoronaviruses","single-stranded RNA viruses","biochemical analyses","amino acids","role","model","location","well-being","mutation","pigs","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, a fundamental and as of yet poorly addressed limitation of such approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. Specifically, the position of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between the sampled pathogen genomes. To quantify and compare the useful genetic diversity expected from genetic data in different pathogen outbreaks, we introduce here the concept of \u2018transmission divergence\u2019, defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. Using parameter values obtained by literature review, we simulate outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution using two models described in the literature to describe transmission divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. We find that while mean values vary significantly between the pathogens considered, their transmission divergence is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterised by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. We describe the impact of transmission divergence on our ability to reconstruct outbreaks using two outbreak reconstruction tools, the R packages outbreaker and phybreak, and demonstrate that, in agreement with previous observations, genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses can provide valuable information on individual transmission events. Conversely, sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events. Our results highlight the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios, and demonstrate the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.","publish_time":"2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campbell, Finlay; Strang, Camilla; Ferguson, Neil; Cori, Anne; Jombart, Thibaut","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d62945f450e20fa12213b58d43cd1d0348de2e5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5821398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420641/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006885","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shigella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic data","impact of transmission divergence","sequence data of pathogens","individual transmission events","lower mean transmission divergence","genome sequence data","identical transmission pairs","reconstructing transmission trees","informational limitations of genetic sequence data","types of epidemiological data","useful genetic diversity","major outbreak","sequence evolution","certain outbreak scenarios","toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools","evolving pathogens","different pathogen outbreaks","infectious disease outbreaks","sampled pathogen genomes","valuable information","genome sequences","literature review","number of mutations","epidemiological timescales","parameter values","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Clostridium difficile","Shigella sonnei","development of numerous methodologies","R packages outbreaker","RNA viruses","approaches","large numbers","previous observations","ability","requirement","models","agreement","need","position of infected individuals","addressed limitation","phybreak","results","concept","Recent years"],"language":"en"},

Seed viruses for cell\u2010based vaccines can be prepared from clinical specimens by cell culture; however, clinical samples risk harboring respiratory viruses other than influenza virus. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the patterns of co\u2010infection in clinical samples and explore whether cell culture technology can selectively propagate influenza viruses from samples containing other respiratory viruses. METHODS: A total of 341 clinical specimens were collected from patients with influenza or influenza\u2010like illness and analyzed by ResPlex II assay to detect 18 respiratory viruses. The patterns of co\u2010infection were statistically analyzed with Fisher\u0027s exact test. The samples with double or triple infections were passaged in suspension MDCK cells (MDCK\u2010S), adherent MDCK cells (MDCK\u2010A), and LLC\u2010MK2D cells. Cell\u2010passaged samples were analyzed by ResPlex II assay again to investigate whether each cell line could amplify influenza viruses and eliminate other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Double infections were detected in 8.5% and triple infections in 0.9% of the collected clinical specimens. We identified four pairs of viruses with significant correlation. For all samples with double and triple infection, MDCK\u2010S and MDCK\u2010A could selectively propagate influenza viruses, while eliminating all contaminating viruses. In contrast, LLC\u2010MK2D showed lower isolation efficiency for influenza virus and higher isolation efficiency for coxsackievirus/echovirus than MDCK\u2010S and MDCK\u2010A. CONCLUSIONS: Both MDCK\u2010S and MDCK\u2010A are considered suitable for the preparation of influenza vaccine seed viruses without adventitious agents or egg\u2010adaptation mutations.","publish_time":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harada, Yuichi; Takahashi, Hitoshi; Trusheim, Heidi; Roth, Bernhard; Mizuta, Katsumi; Hirata\u2010Saito, Asumi; Ogane, Teruko; Odagiri, Takato; Tashiro, Masato; Yamamoto, Norio","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98aca16ac6513c25abcf54bc1dbe7b6fe65e9c49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7040968.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["ResPlex II","MDCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","respiratory viruses","pairs of viruses","contaminating viruses","based influenza vaccines","preparation of influenza vaccine seed viruses","suspension MDCK cells","adherent MDCK cells","clinical samples risk","passaged samples","cell line","collected clinical specimens","based vaccines","cell culture technology","triple infections","Double infections","MK2D cells","patterns of co\u2010infection","LLC","assay","ResPlex","frequent occurrence of egg adaptation","higher isolation efficiency","lower isolation efficiency","adaptation mutations","adventitious agents","coxsackievirus","echovirus","antigenic changes","problem","illness","BACKGROUND","patients","CONCLUSIONS","Fisher\u0027s exact test","contrast","significant correlation","total","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Influenza A virus (IAV) produces double-stranded RNA as an intermediate during the replication life cycle, which activates the intracellular pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and antiviral interferon. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate innate immune responses to IAV and other viruses is of key importance to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Here we used myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice to examine the role of the ubiquitin-editing protein A20 in the response of myeloid cells to IAV infection. A20 deficient macrophages were hyperresponsive to double stranded RNA and IAV infection, as illustrated by enhanced NF-\u03BAB and IRF3 activation, concomitant with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon. In vivo this was associated with an increased number of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of IAV infected mice. Surprisingly, myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice are protected against lethal IAV infection. These results challenge the general belief that an excessive host proinflammatory response is associated with IAV-induced lethality, and suggest that under certain conditions inhibition of A20 might be of interest in the management of IAV infections.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maelfait, Jonathan; Roose, Kenny; Bogaert, Pieter; Sze, Mozes; Saelens, Xavier; Pasparakis, Manolis; Carpentier, Isabelle; van Loo, Geert; Beyaert, Rudi","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/650c105dc3718ea36a7abffa0de7f9068390045f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3291650.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22396652/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002570","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lethal IAV infection","IAV-induced lethality","management of IAV infections","lungs of IAV infected mice","myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice","protein A20","A20 deficient macrophages","response of myeloid cells","increased production of proinflammatory cytokines","double-stranded RNA","double stranded RNA","excessive host proinflammatory response","certain conditions inhibition of A20","viruses","innate immune responses","specific microbial molecules","increased number of alveolar macrophages","antiviral interferon","IRF3 activation","neutrophils","concomitant","hyperresponsive","key importance","general belief","enhanced NF-\u03BAB","pathogens","intracellular pathogen recognition receptor RIG","role","chemokines","line of defense","replication life cycle","novel therapeutic strategies","mechanisms","ubiquitin","results","Influenza"],"language":"en"},

The most common agent causing viral infections in patients with CF before the age of 3 years is respiratory syncytial virus. Objectives To obtain the prevalence of the different types of viral infection in CF patients and to identify its relation with the type of bacterial infection, (CFTR) mutations and pulmonary function test (PFT). Methodology A retrospective charts review of 387 patients with CF of all age groups who were screened for the detection of viruses during respiratory exacerbation from the period of January 1, 1984 to June 1, 2016. Results A total of 159 CF patients had pulmonary exacerbation and had viral PCR obtained. Fifty-eight patients (36%) had positive viral PCR. Males were more commonly infected in 30/58 patients (52%) compared to females in 28 patients (48%). Forty-five of 58 patients (78%) were alive and 13 patients (22%) died. Rhinovirus was the most frequently reported viral PCR in 33/74 sample (45%). Out of 74 viral PCR, 41 (55.4%) were during the colder seasons (October\u2013February) and 33 (44.5%) during the warmer seasons (March\u2013September). During viral infection and viral recurrence, there was an increase in bacterial colonization specifically of H. influenza and staphylococcus aureus. The most common CFTR mutation for the CF viral infection is: 3120\u002B1G\u003EA in Intron 16 in 11/57 patients (19%). The Eastern Province had the highest viral infection of 24 out of 57 patients (42%). Follow-up PFT post viral infection showed no significant difference in the type and the severity of PFT compared to the initial PFT during the viral illness. Conclusion Viral infections contributed to the increase in morbidity and mortality of CF patients in our population, and rhinovirus was the most common causative agent. Viral infections and viral recurrence increased the prevalence of bacterial infection of specific pathogens such as H. influenza and S. aureus. Physicians should be aware to prevent progressive lung damage in CF patients by treating the concomitant viral and bacterial infections. Viral infection may be associated with some common CFTR mutations.","publish_time":"2019-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banjar, Hanaa; Chaballout, Mohammad; Karkour, Kawthar; Al-Ghamdi, Hadeel; Al-Mogarri, Ibrahim; Al-Haider, Sami; Nizami, Imran; Raja, Rawia; AlNakhli, Ali","journal":"Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd563a43d4a1a9cbd99d9f45b675a3caeced66a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102630.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352646718302138; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352646718302138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292813/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpam.2019.09.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":["CF","PCR","CFTR","PFT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CF viral infection","viral recurrence","viral illness","highest viral infection","mortality of CF patients","Conclusion Viral infections","positive viral PCR","different types of viral infection","type of bacterial infection","bacterial infections","prevalence of bacterial infection of specific pathogens","common CFTR mutations","common agent","initial PFT","bacterial colonization","severity of PFT","respiratory exacerbation","Follow-up PFT","respiratory viruses","common causative agent","pulmonary exacerbations","increase","influenza","Rhinovirus","pulmonary function test","respiratory syncytial virus","age groups","detection of viruses","staphylococcus aureus","colder seasons","warmer seasons","progressive lung damage","years","cystic fibrosis","significant difference","morbidity","relation","retrospective charts review","Eastern Province","population","Abstract Introduction Studies","Methodology","period","total","Physicians","Intron","sample","Objectives","females"],"language":"en"},

Proteins with nucleic acid chaperone activities are encoded by many viruses (e.g., retroviruses, coronaviruses) to facilitate RNA structural rearrangements and RNA\u2013RNA interactions during the viral replicative cycle. Since the core protein of flaviviruses is also endowed with potent RNA chaperone activities, we decided to examine the effect of West Nile virus (WNV) core on 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 genomic RNA annealing in vitro. Core protein binding resulted in a dramatic, dose-dependent increase in 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 complex formation.

While many coronaviruses (CoVs) encode two viroporins, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) encodes three: proteins 3a, E, and 8a. Additionally, proteins 3a and E have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which can potentially bind over 400 cellular proteins which contain a PDZ domain, making them potentially important for the control of cell function. In the present work, a comparative study of the functional motifs included within the SARS-CoV viroporins was performed, mostly focusing on the roles of the IC and PBM of E and 3a proteins. Our results showed that the full-length E and 3a proteins were required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence, whereas viroporin 8a had only a minor impact on these activities. A virus missing both the E and 3a proteins was not viable, whereas the presence of either protein with a functional PBM restored virus viability. E protein IC activity and the presence of its PBM were necessary for virulence in mice. In contrast, the presence or absence of the homologous motifs in protein 3a did not influence virus pathogenicity. Therefore, dominance of the IC and PBM of protein E over those of protein 3a was demonstrated in the induction of pathogenesis in mice.","publish_time":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Casta\u00F1o-Rodriguez, Carlos; Honrubia, Jose M.; Guti\u00E9rrez-\u00C1lvarez, Javier; DeDiego, Marta L.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jimenez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Verdia-B\u00E1guena, Carmina; Queralt-Mart\u00EDn, Maria; Kochan, Grazyna; Perlman, Stanley; Aguilella, Vicente M.; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfbb1dddd2a6d304edf8c9cf1086613210f4a8f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5964350.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02325-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PBM of E","PBM of protein E","E protein IC activity","viral proteins","full-length E","cellular proteins","functional PBM","SARS-CoV viroporins","presence","virus replication","maximal SARS-CoV replication","virus viability","virus pathogenicity","functional motifs","virulence","mice","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","important role","homologous motifs","PDZ domain","induction of pathogenesis","PDZ-binding motif","ion channel","comparative study","absence","processes","present work","control of cell function","CoVs","minor impact","activities","coronaviruses","contrast","results","roles","dominance"],"language":"en"},

We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials. METHODS: Three databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID\u201019 treated with antiretrovirals. RESULTS: From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment. Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID\u201019. In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID\u201019 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant. The second trial found no benefit. The certainty of the evidence for the randomized trials was low. In the observational studies 3 out of 361 patients who received LPV/r died; the certainty of evidence was very low. Three studies reported a possible protective effect of LPV/r as post\u2010exposure prophylaxis. Again, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID\u201019.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ford, Nathan; Vitoria, Marco; Rangaraj, Ajay; Norris, Susan L; Calmy, Alexandra; Doherty, Meg","journal":"J Int AIDS Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2770a544de8546224f61ef69ef36be0ec8fcbd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158851.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293807/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25489","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LPV","MERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical outcomes of patients","observational studies","clinical trials","r group","clinical improvement","treatment outcomes","treatment of COVID","randomized trials","certainty of evidence","clinical outcome data","SARS","severe COVID","possible protective effect of LPV","treatment of coronaviruses","available evidence","use of antiretroviral drugs","high risk of acquiring COVID","MERS","antiretrovirals","significant difference","shorter time","day mortality","days of symptoms","control group","infection","uncertainty","post\u2010exposure prophylaxis","identified coronavirus","titles","prevention","standard of care","illness","initial screen","limited sample size","basis","disease","databases","RESULTS","inception","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","benefit"],"language":"en"},

Bronchiectasis is also increasingly identified as an underlying cause of chronic cough highlighting the interrelationship between the two conditions that share overlapping clinical features. Several therapeutic approaches have illustrated positive effects on bronchiectasis-associated cough, however, more focused treatment of heterogeneous cough subtypes may yield better outcomes for patients. A current challenge is the identification of bronchiectasis and cough endophenotypes that may allow improved patient stratification and more targeted therapeutic matching of the right treatment to the right patient. Here we discuss the complex disease phenotypes of bronchiectasis and their interrelationship with cough while considering current and emerging treatment options.

Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases.

Foreign nationality, non-Chinese ethnicity, and age above 40 years were independently associated with baseline LTBI, whereas having \u003E2 TB exposure episodes and working in internal medicine, medical subspecialties, and psychiatry wards were associated with QFT-GIT conversion. Discussion The QFT-GIT conversion rate among screened HCWs is low. Foreign HCWs with LTBI likely came from countries with higher TB transmission. Targeted prevention of repeated TB exposures can reduce QFT-GIT conversion. Conclusions The study results will guide TB contact tracing protocols in health care institutions.","publish_time":"2019-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chia, Shi Zhe Gabriel; How, Kue Bien Molly; Chlebicki, Maciej Piotr; Ling, Moi Lin; Gan, Wee Hoe","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db1f2e3f0b16df42a30f5bbb6b7508127a05de1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132713.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665531930906X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665531930906X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31806237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW","LTBI"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["TB exposure episodes","positive QFT-TB","TB exposure events","latent TB infection","QuantiFERON-TB Gold","higher TB transmission","index TB patients","QFT-GIT conversion rate","Foreign HCWs","screened HCWs","exposed HCWs","TB contact tracing protocols","Targeted prevention of repeated TB exposures","baseline LTBI","total","study results","acquisition rate","risk factors","Demographic factors","study period","health care workers","health care institutions","retrospective cohort study","Foreign nationality","internal medicine","non-Chinese ethnicity","tube assay","medical subspecialties","psychiatry wards","countries","cases","age","years","tuberculosis","Discussion","modified Poisson regression model","Methods","Conclusions","tertiary hospital","Singapore","Background","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Co-infections have been described for several respiratory viruses, especially with influenza. Outcomes of viral pneumonia, including cases with co-infections, have not been well described. This was observational cohort study conducted to describe hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia including co-infections, clinical outcomes, and predictors of mortality. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with a positive respiratory virus panel (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia within 48 h of the index RVP were included. Co-respiratory infection (CRI) was defined as any organism identification from a respiratory specimen within 3 days of the index RVP. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on univariate analysis were evaluated in a multivariate model. Of 284 patients with viral pneumonia, a majority (51.8%) were immunocompromised. A total of 84 patients (29.6%) were found to have a CRI with 48 (57.6%) having a bacterial CRI. Viral CRI with HSV, CMV, or both occurred in 28 patients (33.3%). Fungal (16.7%) and other CRIs (7.1%) were less common. Many patients required mechanical ventilation (54%) and vasopressor support (36%). Overall in-hospital mortality was high (23.2%) and readmissions were common with several patients re-hospitalized within 30 (21.1%) and 90 days (36.7%) of discharge. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on multivariate regression included severity of illness factors, stem-cell transplant, and identification of multiple respiratory viruses. In conclusion, hospital mortality is high among adult patients with viral pneumonia and patients with multiple respiratory viruses identified may be at a higher risk.","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crotty, Matthew P.; Meyers, Shelby; Hampton, Nicholas; Bledsoe, Stephanie; Ritchie, David J.; Buller, Richard S.; Storch, Gregory A.; Micek, Scott T.; Kollef, Marin H.","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cfaf4c8791d75c45d2d5c52a6e2da74363d2565.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5058945.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26683973/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000002332","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized patients","adult patients","Viral CRI","patients re-","Outcomes of viral pneumonia","hospital mortality","respiratory specimen","Co-infections","Co-respiratory infection","predictors of mortality","increased recognition of viral respiratory infections","identification of multiple respiratory viruses","radiographic findings of pneumonia","positive respiratory virus panel","index RVP","bacterial CRI","days","clinical outcomes","multivariate regression","organism identification","multivariate model","severity of illness factors","stem-cell transplant","polymerase-chain reaction","cases","univariate analysis","Advanced technologies","readmissions","majority","observational cohort study","HSV","CMV","conclusion","mechanical ventilation","influenza","vasopressor support","higher risk","discharge","total","CRIs"],"language":"en"},

Using a viral metagenomics approach, we analyzed the virome of feces from wild and captive red-crowned cranes, which were pooled separately. Vertebrate viruses belonging to the families Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, and Caliciviridae were detected. Among the members of the family Picornaviridae, we found three that appear to represent new genera. Six nearly complete genomes from members of the family Parvoviridae were also obtained, including four new members of the proposed genus \u201CChapparvovirus\u201D, and two members of the genus Aveparvovirus. Six small circular DNA genomes were also characterized. One nearly complete genome showing a low level of sequence identity to caliciviruses was also characterized. Numerous viruses believed to infect insects, plants, and crustaceans were also identified, which were probably derived from the diet of red-crowned cranes.

We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses.

However, little information is available on the chemical properties of the resulting ashes. In the present study, 22HW ash samples, including 14 samples of bottom ash and eight samples of fly ash, were collected from four typical HW incineration plants located across China. Chemical analysis indicated that the HW ashes contained large amounts of metal salts of Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na with a concentration range of 1.8\u2013315gkg\u22121. Furthermore, the ashes contained high concentrations of heavy metals such as Ag, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Ti, Sb, Sn, Sr, Zn with a vast range of 1.1\u2013121,411mgkg\u22121, with higher concentrations found in the fly ash samples. Sequential extraction results showed that Ba, Cr, Ni and Sn are present in the residual fraction, while Cd existed in the exchangeable and carbonate fractions. As, Mn, Zn existed in the Fe\u2013Mn oxide fraction, Pb was present in the Fe\u2013Mn oxide and residual fractions, and Cu was present in the organic matter fraction. Furthermore, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) results indicated that leached amounts of Cd, Cu and Pb from almost all fly ash samples exceeded the USEPA regulated levels. A comparison between the HW ashes and municipal solid waste (MSW) ash showed that both HW bottom ash and fly ash contained higher concentrations of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ti, and Zn. This research provides critical information for appropriate HW incineration ash management plans.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Lijuan; Zhang, Fu-Shen; Wang, Kaisheng; Zhu, Jianxin","journal":"Waste Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4e50b8285d678f5e9bd9982e2181ce64b9bbc61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990557/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2008.09.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X08002973; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956053X08002973","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HW ash samples","samples of fly ash","fly ash samples","HW ashes","Pb","appropriate HW incineration ash management plans","Fe","typical HW incineration plants","Mn oxide fraction","Zn","present study","resulting ashes","leached amounts of Cd","higher concentrations of Ag","Sn","China","Ba","Bi","residual fractions","Abstract Incineration","organic matter fraction","hospital waste","critical information","high concentrations of heavy metals","little information","chemical properties","Chemical analysis","vast range","carbonate fractions","concentration range","municipal solid waste","Sequential extraction results","large amounts of metal salts of Al","TCLP","Sr","main mechanism","Sb","MSW","outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","disposal","toxicity characteristic leaching procedure","SARS","mgkg","research","USEPA","comparison","levels"],"language":"en"},

The effects of changes in the state of economy (real GDP growth rate, \u0394 GDP ) and tourism growth (growth rate of total foreign tourist arrivals, \u0394 TA ) on the corporate performance of tourist hotels are then examined via panel regression tests. Test results show that both \u0394 GDP and \u0394 TA are significant explanatory factors of OPR, but only \u0394 TA can strongly explain ROA and ROE. However, neither \u0394 GDP nor \u0394 TA have a significant influence on hotel stock performance. Further, the economic factor ( \u0394 GDP ) is slightly more crucial than the industry factor ( \u0394 TA ) in describing the overall financial performance in the Taiwanese hotel industry.

Several subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) encoding structural proteins are generated by template switching from the body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) to the leader TRS. The process preferentially generates shorter sgmRNA. Appropriate readthrough of body TRSs is required to produce longer sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA. We find that phosphorylation of the viral nucleocapsid (N) by host glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is required for template switching. GSK-3 inhibition selectively reduces the generation of gRNA and longer sgmRNAs, but not shorter sgmRNAs. N phosphorylation allows recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex, which facilitates template readthrough and enables longer sgmRNA synthesis. DDX1 knockdown or loss of helicase activity markedly reduces the levels of longer sgmRNAs. Thus, coronaviruses employ a unique strategy for the transition from discontinuous to continuous transcription to ensure balanced sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2014-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Chia-Hsin; Chen, Pei-Jer; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10ffc58e15bcbe5184c7b33de50078e942b7f390.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0d1357904453b2dddb5668fa24f6514f178c918e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/376f910aba411cdd2e68097e08b4e872ec3fe7ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104987.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2014.09.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312814003424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299332/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312814003424","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shorter sgmRNAs","levels of longer sgmRNAs","balanced sgmRNAs","longer sgmRNA synthesis","N phosphorylation","template readthrough","full-length gRNA synthesis","RNA helicase DDX1","phosphorylated-N","generation of gRNA","Coronaviruses","GSK","continuous transcription","body transcription regulatory sequence","DDX1 knockdown","Appropriate readthrough of body TRSs","leader TRS","nonstructural proteins","loss of helicase activity","host glycogen synthase kinase","transition","recruitment","positive-sense single","viral nucleocapsid","unique strategy","subgenomic mRNAs","inhibition","process"],"language":"en"},

In the simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1) a pseudoknot together with a heptanucleotide slippery sequence are responsible for programmed ribosomal frameshifting, a translational recoding mechanism used to control expression of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from overlapping gag and pol open reading frames. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of the SRV-1 pseudoknot determined by NMR. The structure has a classical H-type fold and forms a triple helix by interactions between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 involving base-base and base-sugar interactions and a ribose zipper motif, not identified in pseudoknots so far. Further stabilization is provided by a stack of five adenine bases and a uracil in loop 2, enforcing a cytidine to bulge. The two stems of the pseudoknot stack upon each other, demonstrating that a pseudoknot without an intercalated base at the junction can induce efficient frameshifting. Results of mutagenesis data are explained in context with the present three-dimensional structure. The two base-pairs at the junction of stem 1 and 2 have a helical twist of approximately 49\u00B0, allowing proper alignment and close approach of the three different strands at the junction. In addition to the overwound junction the structure is somewhat kinked between stem 1 and 2, assisting the single adenosine in spanning the major groove of stem 2. Geometrical models are presented that reveal the importance of the magnitude of the helical twist at the junction in determining the overall architecture of classical pseudoknots, in particular related to the opening of the minor groove of stem 1 and the orientation of stem 2, which determines the number of loop 1 nucleotides that span its major groove.","publish_time":"2001-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michiels, Paul J.A; Versleijen, Alexandra A.M; Verlaan, Paul W; Pleij, Cornelis W.A; Hilbers, Cornelis W; Heus, Hans A","journal":"J Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c48ea0a25364781ba8cd736c7fa271e00ea52f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172549.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283601948235; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283601948235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["junction of stem","base-base","minor groove of stem","major groove of stem","orientation of stem","intercalated base","base-pairs","overwound junction","pseudoknot stack","base-sugar interactions","present three-dimensional structure","SRV","number of loop","RNA pseudoknots","helical twist","overall architecture of classical pseudoknots","Gag-Pol polyprotein","overlapping gag","ribosomal frameshifting","classical H-type fold","efficient frameshifting","simian retrovirus type","pol open reading frames","expression","close approach","translational recoding mechanism","important roles","heptanucleotide slippery sequence","ribose zipper motif","triple helix","context","opening","different strands","adenine bases","nucleotides","biological processes","proper alignment","importance","uracil","magnitude","single adenosine","addition","Results of mutagenesis data","stems","NMR","Geometrical models","stabilization","cytidine"],"language":"en"},

RVs circulated throughout the entire year with a peak in the autumn and a decline in the summer. Some RV types were observed throughout the entire sampling period and others had a more seasonal pattern. Nine RV-A and four RV-B novel provisionally assigned types were identified.

Therefore, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay capable of evaluating the pulmonary microbiome and identifying diverse pathogens in the lungs of immunocompromised children. METHODS: We collected 41 lower respiratory specimens from 34 immunocompromised children undergoing evaluation for pulmonary disease at 3 children\u2019s hospitals from 2014\u20132016. Samples underwent mechanical homogenization, parallel RNA/DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide reference database to determine taxonomic identities. Statistical outliers were determined based on abundance within each sample and relative to other samples in the cohort. RESULTS: We identified a rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome that contained bacteria, fungi, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses in each patient. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous among samples but could be distinguished as possible causes of disease by parsing for outlier organisms. Samples with bacterial outliers had significantly depressed alpha-diversity (median, 0.61; interquartile range [IQR], 0.33\u20130.72 vs median, 0.96; IQR, 0.94\u20130.96; P \u003C .001). Potential pathogens were detected in half of samples previously negative by clinical diagnostics, demonstrating increased sensitivity for missed pulmonary pathogens (P \u003C .001). CONCLUSIONS: An optimized mNGS assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of the lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Potential pathogens can be identified based on absolute and relative abundance. Ongoing investigation is needed to determine the pathogenic significance of outlier microbes in the lungs of immunocompromised children with pulmonary disease.","publish_time":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zinter, Matt S; Dvorak, Christopher C; Mayday, Madeline Y; Iwanaga, Kensho; Ly, Ngoc P; McGarry, Meghan E; Church, Gwynne D; Faricy, Lauren E; Rowan, Courtney M; Hume, Janet R; Steiner, Marie E; Crawford, Emily D; Langelier, Charles; Kalantar, Katrina; Chow, Eric D; Miller, Steve; Shimano, Kristen; Melton, Alexis; Yanik, Gregory A; Sapru, Anil; DeRisi, Joseph L","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c57f276217c4e3f85b0980157c337e847bca2b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6784263.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239621/; https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/1805/21914/1/ciy802.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Center for Biotechnology Information"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary pathogens","pulmonary disease","pulmonary microbes","lungs of immunocompromised children","diverse pathogens","Potential pathogens","lower airways of immunocompromised children","half of samples","diverse bacteria","DNA viruses","RNA viruses","pathogenic bacteria","metagenomic sequencing","rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome","fungi","generation sequencing","Sequencing reads","relative abundance","IQR","pathogenic significance of outlier microbes","optimized mNGS assay","possible causes of disease","assay capable","DNA extraction","parallel RNA","clinical diagnostics","significant inoculation","improved diagnostics","bacterial outliers","Statistical outliers","significant mortality","sensitive metagenomic","vs median","outlier organisms","lower respiratory specimens","Biotechnology Information nucleotide reference database","National Center","increased sensitivity","evaluation","mechanical homogenization","depressed alpha-diversity","detection","taxonomic identities","interquartile range","children\u2019s hospitals","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","patient","cohort","Ongoing investigation"],"language":"en"},

The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.","publish_time":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Stevens, Kim B.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd77fb73da7f98358c0c031cd3fac6a8c27711a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114113.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715002111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26092722/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715002111; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.05.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Data","Hadoop"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel data","data quality","data accessible","data deluge","data needs","temporal data analysis","diverse data sources","spatio-temporal data","large amounts of data","so-called Big Data","appropriate data management tools","emerged discipline of data science","cloud-based data storage","exploratory analysis","opportunities","spectrum of analytical methods","Multi-criteria decision analysis methods","knowledge-driven modelling methods","global economic development","effective management of animal","terms of methodological development","diverse sources","development of hardware technologies","Machine learning regression methods","temporal dimensions","qualitative analytical approaches","important knowledge gaps","analytical methodologies","geographical information systems","human health risks","classical regression approaches","statistical science","control of animal health threats","large datasets","effective prevention","global connectivity","important advances","Internet of Things","published scientific information","Hadoop distributed file systems","detection","spread of existing diseases","expert opinion","attempt","communication infrastructure","emergence of new infectious pathogens","increasing presence","networking","visualisation","complexity","advantage","greater acceptance","higher frequency","wide range of sensors","different types","primary focus","relational databases","developments","value of quantitative","years","reflection","number of areas","challenges","biases","variation","turn","activities"],"language":"en"},

The genomic pool of this macro-community is named microbiome. The gut microbiota is essential for the complete development of the immune system, representing a binary network in which the microbiota interact with the host providing important immune and physiologic function and conversely the bacteria protect themselves from host immune defense. Alterations in the balance of the gut microbiome due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors can now be associated with detrimental or protective effects in experimental autoimmune diseases. These gut microbiome alterations can unbalance the gastrointestinal immune responses and influence distal effector sites leading to CNS disease including both demyelination and affective disorders. The current range of risk factors for MS includes genetic makeup and environmental elements. Of interest to this review is the consistency between this range of MS risk factors and the gut microbiome.

They are recognized as safe by the World Health Organization and some strains have probiotic properties. The wide range of potential applications of LAB-driven mucosal delivery includes control of inflammatory bowel disease, vaccine delivery, and management of auto-immune diseases. Because of this potential, strategies for the display of proteins at the surface of LAB are gaining interest. To display a protein at the surface of LAB, a signal peptide and an anchor domain are necessary. The recombinant protein can be attached to the membrane layer, using a transmembrane anchor or a lipoprotein-anchor, or to the cell wall, by a covalent link using sortase mediated anchoring via the LPXTG motif, or by non-covalent liaisons employing binding domains such as LysM or WxL. Both the stability and functionality of the displayed proteins will be affected by the kind of anchor used. The most commonly surfaced exposed recombinant proteins produced in LAB are antigens and antibodies and the most commonly used LAB are lactococci and lactobacilli. Although it is not necessarily so that surface-display is the preferred localization in all cases, it has been shown that for certain applications, such as delivery of the human papillomavirus E7 antigen, surface-display elicits better biological responses, compared to cytosolic expression or secretion. Recent developments include the display of peptides and proteins targeting host cell receptors, for the purpose of enhancing the interactions between LAB and host. Surface-display technologies have other potential applications, such as degradation of biomass, which is of importance for some potential industrial applications of LAB.","publish_time":"2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michon, C.; Langella, P.; Eijsink, V.

Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases. ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure. There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geier, Mark R.; Geier, David A.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f6f11e17bd7f9752c955a65caa887a547a1b34e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/939e7e1ad5ccbc8e6f0164f8dd5944ea3f13d009.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175905.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344310/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720307659; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720307659?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109760","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ESA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of COVID","ventilator treatments","available treatments","serious respiratory conditions","alternative treatments","respiratory symptoms","serious cases of COVID","effective treatments","standard therapeutic treatments","hallmark features of critical COVID","associated increasing levels of oxygen","novel coronavirus","onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome","low blood oxygenation levels","oxygen binding","hyperbaric oxygen therapy","HBOT","pRBC","patients","novel virus","ESA therapies","ARDS","novel new therapeutic interventions","levels of carbon dioxide","red blood cell","treatment of altitude sickness","Alternate treatment strategies","hemoglobin production","hemoglobin availability","ventilator support","alternative means","oxygenation of tissues","coronavirus disease","vaccines","transfusions","future controlled-clinical trials","acetazolamine","hyperventilation","potential usefulness","early developmental stages","erthropoiesis","agent","nCoV","Anti-viral medications","months","SARS-CoV","hydroxychloroquine","high mortality rates","organ failure","present","years","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

An event study method was used to uncover stock price movements of Jack in the Box, in conjunction with 73 unrelated food crises that occurred from 1994 to 2010. Stock prices of Jack in the Box exhibited significantly negative responses to other firms\u2019 food crises, moreover, the negative spillover effect was stronger if the crisis occurred closer in time, was similar in nature, and was accompanied with no recall execution.

Methods Clinical assessments of PTSD were conducted at 2, 7, 10, 20 and 46 months after discharge from medical hospitalization for treatment of SARS. Diagnoses of PTSD were established by a trained psychiatrist using the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD-III) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. To study the impact of PTSD, we used the Impact of Event Scale (IES), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Short Form-36 (SF-36 Health Survey) and Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS). Results Of the 68 subjects who finished at least two follow-up interviews, 30 developed PTSD over the study period (44.1%). Scores on IES, SAS, SDS and SCL-90 (P\u003C.0001) were higher, and functional impairment as measured by SF-36 (P\u003C.0001) and SDSS was more severe (P=.0073) for subjects with PTSD. Conclusion PTSD occurs in a significant percentage of subjects who recover from SARS, and the occurrence of PTSD predicts persistent psychological distress and diminished social functioning in the 4 years after SARS treatment.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Xia; Currier, Glenn W.; Zhao, Xiaohui; Jiang, Yinan; Zhou, Wei; Wei, Jing","journal":"General Hospital Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3eedb0da9a521925560dd4953f34be400ca81f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112559.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834309001340; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834309001340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892213/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2009.06.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTSD","SARS","Social Disability","SAS","SDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of PTSD","developed PTSD","occurrence of PTSD","Conclusion PTSD","Diagnoses of PTSD","treatment of SARS","SARS treatment","Methods Clinical assessments of PTSD","Impact of Event Scale","Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale","Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale","SAS","IES","SCL","significant percentage of subjects","SF","SDSS","Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders","Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","impact of posttraumatic stress disorder","study period","diminished social functioning","Social Disability Screening Schedule","severe acute respiratory syndrome","persistent psychological distress","incidence","Edition","Health Survey","CCMD","medical hospitalization","years","cohort","trained psychiatrist","Symptom Checklist","discharge","DSM-IV","follow-up interviews","criteria","months","functional impairment","Short Form","Scores","Abstract Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

More recently, technologies have been developed\u2014or adapted from other fields, such as nanotechnology\u2014to allow for the real-time quantification of physical virion particles, while supplying additional information such as particle diameter concomitantly. These technologies have progressed to the stage of commercialization increasing the speed of viral titer measurements from hours to minutes, thus providing a significant advantage for many aspects of virology research and biotechnology applications. Additional advantages lie in the broad spectrum of virus species that may be measured and the possibility to determine the ratio of infectious to total particles. A series of disadvantages remain associated with these technologies, such as a low specificity for viral particles. In this review we will discuss these technologies by comparing four systems for real-time single virus particle analysis and quantification.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heider, Susanne; Metzner, Christoph","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/202bb7da5aeb4f330326c88600089eca3de7af9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4139191.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214002669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24999044/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214002669","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["technologies","single virus particles","viral particles","total particles","real-time single virus particle analysis","real-time quantification of physical virion particles","additional information","broad spectrum of virus species","Additional advantages","particle diameter","speed of viral titer measurements","minutes","systems","aspects of virology research","hours","long time","significant advantage","biotechnology applications","ratio of infectious","low specificity","Abstract","stage of commercialization","domain of electron microscopy","series of disadvantages","possibility","nanotechnology","fields","review"],"language":"en"},

As infectious diseases evolve and develop resistance to existing pharmaceuticals, the marine environment provides novel leads against fungal, parasitic, bacterial, and viral diseases. Many marine natural products have successfully advanced to the late stages of clinical trials, including dolastatin 10, ecteinascidin-743, kahalalide F, and aplidine, and a growing number of candidates have been selected as promising leads for extended preclinical assessment. Although many marine-product clinical trials are for cancer chemotherapy, drug resistance, emerging infectious diseases, and the threat of bioterrorism have all contributed to the interest in assessing natural ocean products in the treatment of infectious organisms. In this review, we focus on the pharmacologically tested marine leads that have shown in-vivo efficacy or potent in-vitro activity against infectious and parasitic diseases.","publish_time":"2003-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donia, Marwa; Hamann, Mark T","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48cbd814e29c74f03a7da3754cd592bed6e5e52b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106398.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309903006558; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309903006558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["marine leads","marine natural products","emerging infectious diseases","parasitic diseases","marine environment","marine bacteria","marine-product clinical trials","viral diseases","natural ocean products","novel leads","promising leads","treatment of infectious organisms","diverse array of natural products","drug resistance","late stages of clinical trials","cancer chemotherapy","vitro activity","unique resource","existing pharmaceuticals","aplidine","tunicates","ecteinascidin","extended preclinical assessment","molluscs","dolastatin","invertebrates","growing number of candidates","kahalalide F","bryozoans","sponges","Summary","oceans","efficacy","threat of bioterrorism","cyanobacteria","review"],"language":"en"},

During the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. METHODS: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. RESULTS: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team\u2019s exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia\u2019s resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is often used to evaluate their aetiology. However, it may not always be easily performed. Thus, alternative diagnostic strategies may be needed. There is limited data on the correlation of nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory viral panel (RVP)\u2010PCR testing compared with BAL. We aimed to identify the predictive value of NP RVP\u2010PCR samples compared with samples obtained from BAL in immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective study of immunosuppressed adults who underwent bronchoscopy in the Pulmonary Department at the University of Rochester Medical Center between January 2011 and June 2016. We compared the positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity and false negative rate of NP RVP\u2010PCR and BAL RVP\u2010PCR, as well as identified clinical predictors of positive viral BAL RVP\u2010PCR. RESULTS: Eighty\u2010nine immunosuppressed patients had both NP and bronchoalveolar RVP\u2010PCR testing. Twenty\u2010one patients had NP(\u002B)BAL(\u002B) RVP\u2010PCR testing. Seven patients had false negative (NP(\u2212)BAL(\u002B)) RVP\u2010PCR testing. Three patients had NP(\u002B)BAL(\u2212) RVP\u2010PCR testing. The positive and negative predictive values of NP RVP\u2010PCR testing were 88% and 89%, respectively.

Despite global studies on the genetic diversity of the virus, the serotype diversity of these viruses across diverse geographic regions in Kenya has not been characterized. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to characterize the serotype diversity of HRV strains that circulated in Kenya in 2008. METHODS: A total of 517 archived nasopharyngeal samples collected in a previous respiratory virus surveillance program across Kenya in 2008 were selected. Participants enrolled were outpatients who presented with influenza\u2010like (ILI) symptoms. Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR was employed for preliminary HRV detection. HRV\u2010positive samples were amplified using RT\u2010PCR and thereafter the nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were determined followed by phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty\u2010five percent of the samples tested positive for HRV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Kenyan HRVs clustered into three main species comprising HRV\u2010A (54%), HRV\u2010B (12%), and HRV\u2010C (35%). Overall, 20 different serotypes were identified. Intrastrain sequence homology among the Kenyan strains ranged from 58% to 100% at the nucleotide level and 55% to 100% at the amino acid level. CONCLUSION: These results show that a wide range of HRV serotypes with different levels of nucleotide variation were present in Kenya. Furthermore, our data show that HRVs contributed substantially to influenza\u2010like illness in Kenya in 2008.","publish_time":"2016-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milanoi, Sylvia; Ongus, Juliette R.; Gachara, George; Coldren, Rodney; Bulimo, Wallace","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8233e375e79b4e93b9d9a614d44762dba52b342f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4814864.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26822469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["serotype diversity of HRV strains","preliminary HRV detection","wide range of HRV serotypes","Kenyan HRVs","positive samples","nucleotide level","genetic diversity","PCR","different serotypes","Kenyan strains","nucleotide sequences","influenza","RESULTS","phylogenetic analysis","different levels of nucleotide variation","archived nasopharyngeal samples","recent studies","global studies","Real\u2010time RT","previous respiratory virus surveillance program","amino acid level","severe acute respiratory illnesses","SARIs","pneumonia","well\u2010established cause","diverse geographic regions","total","Intrastrain sequence homology","amplicons","main species","Human rhinoviruses","asthma","BACKGROUND","study","percent","bronchiolitis","METHODS","outpatients","ILI","symptoms","Participants","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSION","data"],"language":"en"},

Enveloped viruses predominantly infect animal cells although a few are known to infect plants, bacteria, and Archaea. The lipid bilayer can be derived from a variety of cellular membranes with the plasma membrane being the most common source. The presence of the lipid envelope allows enveloped viruses to bud out of cells without disrupting the cell membrane and, therefore, require an intact cell for particle release. Viral glycoproteins are found embedded in the lipid bilayer, usually in the form of transmembrane proteins, which allows communication of viral components across the membrane. These glycoproteins play crucial roles in the virus life cycle including assembly, budding, receptor binding, and membrane fusion. The assembly of two groups of icosahedral enveloped viruses (the alphaviruses and the flaviviruses) is described in detail in this article in order to present common themes in enveloped virus assembly.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Navaratnarajah, C.

Before the release of its genome into the host cell cytoplasm, viruses operate a complex sequence of events that take place at the plasma membrane of the target cell. The first step is the binding of the HIV protein envelope (Env) to the cellular receptor CD4. This triggers conformational changes of the gp120 viral protein that allow its interaction with a co-receptor that can be either CCR5 or CXCR4, defining the tropism of the virus entering the cell. This sequential interaction finally drives the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane or to the endocytosis of the viruses. Here, we discuss how the membrane composition and organization of both the virus and the target cell can affect these steps and thus influence the capability of the viruses to infect cells.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dumas, Fabrice; Preira, Pascal; Salom\u00E9, Laurence","journal":"Biochimie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf16161587fb3f5199b013ab4c3ff63ad882a2c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126522.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908414002466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193376/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908414002466; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.08.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["target cell","host cell membrane","viruses","host cell cytoplasm","viral tropism","gp120 viral protein","plasma membrane","membrane composition","Human Immunodeficiency Virus","HIV protein envelope","initial steps","co-receptor","sequential interaction","cellular receptor CD4","replication cycle","crucial role","complex sequence of events","place","fusion","triggers conformational changes","CCR5","binding","genome","endocytosis","infection efficiency","capability","organization","CXCR4","release","cells"],"language":"en"},

However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact. We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels. METHODS: In the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels. Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests. We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, \u03C7(2), and Fisher\u0027s exact tests to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2012, and Dec 1, 2013, we obtained individual serum samples from 10 009 individuals. Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0\u00B715%; 95% CI 0\u00B709\u20130\u00B724) of 10 009 people in six of the 13 provinces. The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43\u00B75 years [SD 17\u00B73] vs 53\u00B78 years [17\u00B75]; p=0\u00B7008). Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0\u00B725%] of 4341 vs two [0\u00B705%] of 4378; p=0\u00B7028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0\u00B726%] of 5479 vs one [0\u00B702%] of 4529; p=0\u00B7003). Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2\u00B73%] of 87, p=0\u00B70004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3\u00B76%] of 140; p\u003C0\u00B70001). INTERPRETATION: Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. By simple multiplication, a projected 44 951 (95% CI 26 971\u201371 922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.

It is associated with excess mortality, stunting and malnutrition. The most common manifestation of cryptosporidium is intestinal diarrheal disease. However, respiratory cryptosporidiosis has been documented in up to a third of children presenting with diarrhea. It is unclear whether respiratory involvement is a transient phenomenon or a reservoir for gastrointestinal (GI) disease. This study aims to evaluate the role of respiratory cryptosporidiosis in pediatric diarrheal disease. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational study conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. Young children aged 2\u201324 months hospitalized with diarrhea will be enrolled. Enrolled children will have induced sputum, nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and stool samples collected. All participants positive for cryptosporidium on sputum/NP/stool PCR testing will be followed up fortnightly after discharge from the hospital up to 8 weeks post-discharge. Sputum/NP/stool sample collection will be done at each visit. The primary outcomes will be presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in sputum/NP/stool. The secondary outcome will be presence of respiratory and GI symptoms, mortality and stunting. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) research ethics committee. DISCUSSION: The study began recruitment activities at QECH in February 2019. The protocol allows for expansion of recruitment to secondary sites within Blantyre and Chikwawa districts in the event that targets are not met at QECH.

{"cord_uid":"zrqp24gb","sha":null,"source_x":"Medline; PMC","title":"Major Infection Events Over 5 Years: How Is Media Coverage Influencing Online Information Needs of Health Care Professionals and the Public?","doi":"10.2196/jmir.2146","pmcid":"PMC3713905","pubmed_id":"23856364","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The last decade witnessed turbulent events in public health. Emerging infections, increase of antimicrobial resistance, deliberately released threats and ongoing battles with common illnesses were amplified by the spread of disease through increased international travel. The Internet has dramatically changed the availability of information about outbreaks; however, little research has been done in comparing the online behavior of public and professionals around the same events and the effect of media coverage of outbreaks on information needs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate professional and public online information needs around major infection outbreaks and correlate these with media coverage. Questions include (1) How do health care professionals\u2019 online needs for public health and infection control information differ from those of the public?, (2) Does dramatic media coverage of outbreaks contribute to the information needs among the public?, and (3) How do incidents of diseases and major policy events relate to the information needs of professionals? METHODS: We used three longitudinal time-based datasets from mid-2006 until end of 2010: (1) a unique record of professional online behavior on UK infection portals: National electronic Library of Infection and National Resource of Infection Control (NeLI/NRIC), (2) equivalent public online information needs (Google Trends), and (3) relevant media coverage (LexisNexis). Analysis of NeLI/NRIC logs identified the highest interest around six major infectious diseases: Clostridium difficile (C difficile)/Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tuberculosis, meningitis, norovirus, and influenza. After pre-processing, the datasets were analyzed and triangulated with each other. RESULTS: Public information needs were more static, following the actual disease occurrence less than those of professionals, whose needs increase with public health events (eg, MRSA/C difficile) and the release of major national policies or important documents. Media coverage of events resulted in major public interest (eg, the 2007/2008 UK outbreak of C difficile/MRSA). An exception was norovirus, showing a seasonal pattern for both public and professionals, which matched the periodic disease occurrence. Meningitis was a clear example of a disease with heightened media coverage tending to focus on individual and celebrity cases. Influenza was a major concern during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak creating massive public interest in line with the spring and autumn peaks in cases; although in autumn 2009, there was no corresponding increase in media coverage. Online resources play an increasing role in fulfilling professionals\u2019 and public information needs. CONCLUSIONS: Significant factors related to a surge of professional interest around a disease were typically key publications and major policy changes. Public interests seem more static and correlate with media influence but to a lesser extent than expected. The only exception was norovirus, exhibiting online public and professional interest correlating with seasonal occurrences of the disease. Public health agencies with responsibility for risk communication of public health events, in particular during outbreaks and emergencies, need to collaborate with media in order to ensure the coverage is high quality and evidence-based, while professionals\u2019 information needs remain mainly fulfilled by online open access to key resources.","publish_time":"2013-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kostkova, Patty; Fowler, David; Wiseman, Sue; Weinberg, Julius R","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3713905.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","Google Trends","NeLI/NRIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Public information needs","equivalent public online information needs","online behavior of public","Public interests","Public health agencies","information needs of professionals","professionals\u2019 information needs","Media coverage of events","needs increase","risk communication of public health events","heightened media coverage","relevant media coverage","effect of media coverage of outbreaks","dramatic media coverage of outbreaks","major infection outbreaks","infection control information","health care professionals\u2019 online needs","availability of information","major policy events","Online resources","media influence","major concern","turbulent events","spread of disease","major infectious diseases","major policy changes","unique record of professional online behavior","release of major national policies","MRSA","actual disease occurrence","periodic disease occurrence","norovirus","National Resource of Infection Control","UK outbreak of C difficile","UK infection portals","National electronic Library of Infection","Clostridium difficile","surge of professional","fulfilling professionals\u2019","key resources","meningitis","corresponding increase","influenza","exception","H1N1 outbreak","incidents of diseases","key publications","seasonal pattern","autumn peaks","NRIC logs","Analysis of NeLI","seasonal occurrences","celebrity cases","longitudinal time-based datasets","responsibility","increasing role","threats","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","common illnesses","Google Trends","tuberculosis","spring","evidence","decade","antimicrobial resistance","ongoing battles","important documents","clear example","increased international travel","Significant factors","high quality","open access","Emerging infections","lesser extent","emergencies","LexisNexis","order","RESULTS","little research","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE","Internet","pre-processing","Questions"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to determine if laboratory-grown influenza A (H1N1) virus maintained infectivity on the surfaces of personal protective equipment and clothing used in healthcare settings. METHODS: Influenza A virus (0.5 mL) was deposited on the surface of a rubber glove, an N95 particulate respirator, a surgical mask made of non-woven fabric, a gown made of Dupont Tyvek, a coated wooden desk, and stainless steel. Each sample was left for 1, 8, and 24 h, and hemagglutination (HA) and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/mL were measured. RESULTS: The HA titer of this influenza A virus did not decrease in any of the materials tested even after 24 h. The infectivity of influenza A virus measured by TCID(50) was maintained for 8 h on the surface of all materials, with the exception of the rubber glove for which virus infectivity was maintained for 24 h.

This is true for virtually every aspect of a virus\u0027 replication cycle from virus entry to the budding or release of progeny virus particles. In this chapter, we will discuss new information on the impacts of virus-mediated manipulation of Dynein motor complexes and associated machineries and factors. We will highlight how these host cell components impact on pathogenicity and immune responses, as many of the virus-mediated hijacked components also play pivotal roles in immune responses to pathogen insult. There are several comprehensive reviews that define virus\u2013Dynein interactions including the first edition of this book that describes how viruses manipulate the host cell machineries their advantage. An updated table is included to summarize these virus\u2013host interactions. Notably, barriers to intracellular translocation represent major hurdles to viral components during de novo infection and during active replication and the generation of progeny virus particles. Clearly, the subversion of host cell molecular motor protein activities takes advantage of constitutive and regulated membrane trafficking events and will target virus components to intracytoplasmic locales and membrane assembly. Broadening our understanding of the interplay between viruses, Dynein and the cytoskeleton will likely inform on new types of therapies. Continual enhancement of the breadth of new information on how viruses manipulate host cell biology will inevitably aid in the identification of new targets that can be poisoned to block old, new, and emerging viruses alike in their tracks.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milev, Miroslav P.; Yao, Xaojian; Berthoux, Lionel; Mouland, Andrew J.","journal":"Dyneins","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e906a00291d17be5e5f184cb5cae1930827db2b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150161.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128094709000102; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128094709000102","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus components","virus entry","impacts of virus","host cell machineries","host cell components impact","co-opting host cell components","host cell biology","host interactions","release of progeny virus particles","generation of progeny virus particles","viral components","hijacked components","breadth of new information","emerging viruses","Dynein interactions","subversion of host cell molecular motor protein activities","new types of therapies","identification of new targets","advantage of constitutive","immune responses","associated machineries","mediated manipulation of Dynein motor complexes","replication cycle","active replication","membrane assembly","regulated membrane trafficking events","budding","major hurdles","pivotal roles","membranes","pathogenicity","proteins","intracellular translocation","novo infection","intracytoplasmic locales","pathogen insult","barriers","factors","aspect","cytoskeleton","Continual enhancement","comprehensive reviews","edition","interplay","Abstract","general viruses\u0027","book","understanding","tracks","chapter","updated table"],"language":"en"},

We investigated how alterations in spike affect neurovirulence using two isogenic recombinant viruses differing exclusively in spike. S4R, containing the MHV-4 spike gene, is dramatically more neurovirulent than SA59R, containing the MHV-A59 spike gene (J. J. Phillips, M. M. Chua, E. Lavi, and S. R. Weiss, 1999, J. Virol. 73, 7752\u20137760). We examined the contribution of differences in cellular tropism, viral spread, and the immune response to infection to the differential neurovirulence of S4R and SA59R. MHV-4 spike-mediated neurovirulence was associated with extensive viral spread in the brain in both neurons and astrocytes. Infection of primary hippocampal neuron cultures demonstrated that S4R spread more rapidly than SA59R and suggested that spread may occur between cells in close physical contact. In addition, S4R infection induced a massive influx of lymphocytes into the brain, a higher percentage of CD8\u002B T cells, and a higher frequency of MHV-specific CD8\u002B T cells relative SA59R infection. Despite this robust and viral-specific immune response to S4R infection, infection of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice suggested that immune-mediated pathology also contributes to the high neurovirulence of S4R.","publish_time":"2002-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phillips, Joanna J.; Chua, Ming Ming; Rall, Glenn F.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b22ccfac7cdcbe02773f204b5615808557e1601a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202915515; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202915515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M.

The oldest known epidemic is thought to be the Paris outbreak of 1578. In this Historical Review, we describe three epidemics of whooping cough in Persia, which although arising roughly one century before the Paris outbreak, have not been examined in detail. A great amount of epidemiological detail was reported that not only distinguishes the various stages and complications of whooping cough, but also reveals unique immunological aspects of this disease. The first of these epidemics is the oldest recorded whooping cough epidemic. On the basis of epidemiological features, we propose that this whooping cough epidemic was the first to have taken place in Persia and might have been part of the first pandemic. This theory pushes back the date of first documented emergence of whooping cough by almost a century, which matches molecular data about its spread. Here, we discuss features of these early epidemics in relation to their initial emergence, potential origins, and spread to Europe.","publish_time":"2015-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aslanabadi, Arash; Ghabili, Kamyar; Shad, Kaveh; Khalili, Majid; Sajadi, Mohammad M","journal":"Lancet Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5904a7b668e0fcd9944b1989a89a60b03403804.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164782.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309915002923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26298206/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(15)00292-3; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309915002923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Persia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["epidemics of whooping cough","complications of whooping cough","documented emergence of whooping cough","oldest recorded whooping cough epidemic","early epidemics","century","oldest known epidemic","Persia","Paris outbreak","spread","new infectious disease","basis of epidemiological features","initial emergence","infectious diseases","relation","human beings","potential origins","date","unique immunological aspects","various stages","resurgence","molecular data","decades of vaccination","Europe","Historical Review","theory","place","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

The prior model for this motif contains two helices separated by a three-nucleotide bulge. Modifications to this model were suggested by SHAPE chemical probing of an entire HIV-1 RNA genome. Novel features of the SHAPE-directed model include alternate helical conformations and a larger, more complex structure. These structural elements also support the presence of a secondary frameshift site within the frameshift domain. Here, we use oligonucleotide-directed structure perturbation, probing in the presence of formamide, and in-virion experiments to examine these models. Our data support a model in which the frameshift domain is anchored by a stable helix outside the conventional domain. Less stable helices within the domain can switch from the SHAPE-predicted to the two-helix conformation. Translational frameshifting assays with frameshift domain mutants support a functional role for the interactions predicted by and specific to the SHAPE-directed model.

Here, we investigated APOBEC3-mediated restriction of Coronaviridae. In experiments in vitro, three human APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) inhibited HCoV-NL63 infection and limited production of progeny virus, but did not cause hypermutation of the coronaviral genome. APOBEC3-mediated restriction was partially dependent on enzyme activity, and was reduced by the use of enzymatically inactive APOBEC3. Moreover, APOBEC3 proteins bound to the coronaviral nucleoprotein, and this interaction also affected viral replication.

To ensure their perpetuation, viruses must be transmitted to other susceptible individuals\u2014that is, they must be shed with secretions or excretions into the environment, be taken up by another host or a vector, or be passed congenitally from mother to offspring. Viruses have developed a remarkable variety of strategies to ensure their own survival. Individual viruses cause their associated diseases through a considerable variety of distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Viruses differ greatly in their virulence, but even in a population infected by a particular virus strain, there are usually striking differences in the outcome of infection of individual animals. Similarly, there is much variation among viruses of the same species, and the determinants of viral virulence are often multigenic, meaning that several viral genes contribute to the virulence of individual viruses. The determinants of host resistance/susceptibility are usually multifactorial and include not only a variety of host factors but environmental ones as well. There is wide variation in the virulence of viruses, ranging from those that almost always cause inapparent infections, to those that usually cause disease, to those that usually cause death. Meaningful comparison of the virulence of viruses requires that factors such as the infecting dose of the virus and the age, sex, and condition of the host animals and their immune status be equal; however, these conditions are never met in nature, where heterogeneous, outbred animal populations are the rule and the dynamics of exposure and viral infection are incredibly varied.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Fenner\u0027s Veterinary Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123751584000031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751584000031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulence of viruses","virulence of individual viruses","Publisher Summary Viruses","host animals","variety of host factors","determinants of viral virulence","determinants of host resistance","viral infection","individual animals","viral genes","remarkable variety of strategies","outcome of infection","wide variation","considerable variety of distinct pathogenic mechanisms","particular virus strain","associated diseases","outbred animal populations","dynamics of exposure","multigenic","striking differences","nature","age","sex","immune status","susceptibility","environmental ones","species","infecting dose","Meaningful comparison","secretions","excretions","conditions","susceptible individuals","target tissues","mother","offspring","inapparent infections","survival","vector","perpetuation","death"],"language":"en"},

During this urgency situation, computational drug discovery methods provide an alternative to tiresome high-throughput screening, particularly in the hit-to-lead-optimization stage.

In this work, we present potential compounds that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins, including the main protease, Nsp12 RNA polymerase and Nsp13 helicase. An integrative virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations approach led to the identification of potential binding modes and favourable molecular interaction profile of corresponding compounds. Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis.

The present study aimed to define the role of RIPK1 in hepatocytes during fulminant viral hepatitis, a worldwide syndrome mainly observed in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients. Mice deficient for RIPK1, specifically in liver parenchymal cells (Ripk1(LPC-KO)) and their wild-type littermates (Ripk1(fl/fl)), were challenged by either the murine hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) or poly I:C, a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA mimicking viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern. Ripk1(LPC-KO) mice developed more severe symptoms at early stage of the MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis. Similarly, administration of poly I:C only triggered increase of systemic transaminases in Ripk1(LPC-KO) mice, reflecting liver damage through induced apoptosis as illustrated by cleaved-caspase 3 labeling of liver tissue sections. Neutralization of TNF-\u03B1 or prior depletion of macrophages were able to prevent the appearance of apoptosis of hepatocytes in poly I:C-challenged Ripk1(LPC-KO) mice. Moreover, poly I:C never induced direct hepatocyte death in primary culture whatever the murine genotype, while it always stimulated an anti-viral response. Our investigations demonstrated that RIPK1 protects hepatocytes from TNF-\u03B1 secreted from macrophages during viral induced fulminant hepatitis. These data emphasize the potential worsening risks of an HBV infection in people with polymorphism or homozygous amorphic mutations already described for the RIPK1 gene.","publish_time":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farooq, Muhammad; Filliol, Aveline; Simoes Eug\u00E9nio, M\u00E9lanie; Piquet-Pellorce, Claire; Dion, Sarah; Raguenes-Nicol, C\u00E9line; Jan, Aur\u00E9lien; Dimanche-Boitrel, Marie-Th\u00E9r\u00E8se; Le Seyec, Jacques; Samson, Michel","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a7751b196054ed357f5a0f16eeac17ad2def269.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6325114.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622241/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-018-1277-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of RIPK1","RIPK1 gene","viral induced fulminant hepatitis","fulminant viral hepatitis","protein kinase RIPK1","LPC-KO","induced apoptosis","hepatocytes","murine hepatitis virus type","hepatitis B virus","viral pathogen","Mice deficient","administration of poly","MHV3","TNF-\u03B1","anti-viral response","reflecting liver damage","liver parenchymal cells","HBV infection","crucial role","labeling of liver tissue sections","appearance of apoptosis","murine genotype","Neutralization of TNF","prior depletion of macrophages","wild-type littermates","people","stranded RNA","worldwide syndrome","primary culture","polymorphism","triggered increase of systemic transaminases","synthetic analog of double","direct hepatocyte death","severe symptoms","potential worsening risks","homozygous amorphic mutations","caspase","early stage","infected patients","pathways","crossroad of stress","molecular pattern","data","cell\u2019s decision","present study","investigations"],"language":"en"},

Jugular whole blood samples were collected from Holstein (H) dairy calves (n = 8) artificially fed 5% B.W. colostrum, and from beef calves which were the progenies of Charolais-Limousin (CL; n = 7) and Limousin-Friesian beef suckler cows (LF; n = 7), for subsequent RNA isolation. In dairy calves, there was a surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression possibly due to the stress of separation from the dam. LF calves exhibited early signs of humoral immune development with observed increases in the expression genes coding for Ig receptors, which was not evident in the other breeds by 7 days of age. Immune and health related DEGs identified as upregulated in beef calves are prospective contender genes for the classification of biomarkers for immune-competence development, and will contribute towards a greater understanding of the development of an immune response in neonatal calves.","publish_time":"2018-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Surlis, C.; Earley, B.; McGee, M.; Keogh, K.; Cormican, P.; Blackshields, G.; Tiernan, K.; Dunn, A.; Morrison, S.; Arguello, A.; Waters, S.

There are no reports on molecular characterization of bovine coronavirus in Ireland, and little data exists apart from serological studies. FINDINGS: In this study, 11 neonatal (mean age 9 days) calf BCoV strains from the south of Ireland were collected over a one year period and characterized using molecular methods. The spike gene which encodes a protein involved in viral entry, infectivity and immune response shows the most variability amongst the isolates and was subsequently selected for in depth analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene revealed that the Irish strains clustered with novel BCoV strains from Europe in a unique clade, possibly indicating lineage partitioning. Direct analysis of alignments identified amino acid changes in the spike protein unique to the Irish clade. CONCLUSION: Thus, monitoring of bovine coronavirus in Ireland is important as the current isolates in circulation in the south of Ireland may be diverging from the available vaccine strain, which may have implications regarding future BCoV vaccine efficacy.","publish_time":"2015-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunn, L.; Collins, P.

In this study we characterized the inhibition of PRRS virus (PRRSV) replication by antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). Of 12 peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO), four were found to be highly effective at inhibiting PRRSV replication in cell culture in a dose-dependant and sequence-specific manner. PPMO 5UP2 and 5HP are complementary to sequence in the 5\u2032 end of the PRRSV genome, and 6P1 and 7P1 to sequence in the translation initiation regions of ORF6 and ORF7, respectively. Treatment of cells with 5UP2 or 5HP caused a 4.5log10 reduction in PRRSV yield, compared to a control PPMO. Combination of 6P1 and 7P1 led to higher level reduction than 6P1 or 7P1 alone. 5UP2, 5HP, and a combination of 6P1 and 7P1 inhibited PRRSV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages and protected the cells from PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect. Northern blot and real-time RT-PCR results demonstrated that the effective PPMO led to a reduction of PRRSV RNA level. 5UP2 and 5HP inhibited virus replication of 10 other strains of PRRSV. Results from this study suggest potential applications of PPMO for PRRS control.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Deendayal; Opriessnig, Tanja; Stein, David A.; Halbur, Patrick G.; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Iversen, Patrick L.; Zhang, Yan-Jin","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fcb5335f26d89d64cf5aa7487acbc813d02aa48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114306.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354207004068; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354207004068","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMO","PPMO","PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["7P1 inhibited PRRSV replication","PRRSV yield","PRRSV genome","strains of PRRSV","PPMO 5UP2","inhibiting PRRSV replication","control PPMO","reduction of PRRSV RNA level","effective PPMO","PRRS control","HP inhibited virus replication","Combination of 6P1","inhibition of PRRS virus","potential applications of PPMO","higher level reduction","5log10 reduction","study","sequence-specific manner","Treatment of cells","porcine alveolar macrophages","peptide-conjugated PMO","real-time RT-PCR results","cell culture","dose-dependant","antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers","translation initiation regions of ORF6","respiratory syndrome","Northern blot","decade","ORF7","current strategies","global swine industry","cytopathic effect"],"language":"en"},

CypA plays critical roles in various biological processes, including protein folding, assembly, transportation, regulation of neuron growth, and HIV replication. The discovery of CypA inhibitor is now of a great special interest in the treatment of immunological disorders. In this study, a series of novel small molecular CypA inhibitors have been discovered by using structure-based virtual screening in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay. The SPECS_1 database containing 85,000 small molecular compounds was searched by virtual screening against the crystal structure of human CypA. After SPR-based binding affinity assay, 15 compounds were found to show binding affinities to CypA at submicro-molar or micro-molar level (compounds 1\u201315). Seven compounds were selected as the starting point for the further structure modification in considering binding activity, synthesis difficulty, and structure similarity. We thus synthesized 40 new small molecular compounds (1\u20136, 15, 16a\u2013q, 17a\u2013d, and 18a\u2013l), and four of which (compounds 16b, 16h, 16k, and 18g) showed high CypA PPIase inhibition activities with IC50s of 2.5\u20136.2\u03BCM. Pharmacological assay indicated that these four compounds demonstrated somewhat inhibition activities against the proliferation of spleen cells.","publish_time":"2006-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jian; Chen, Jing; Gui, Chunshan; Zhang, Li; Qin, Yu; Xu, Qiang; Zhang, Jian; Liu, Hong; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d342b920585291466844994bc7794651308c8911.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119052.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089605010679; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089605010679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new small molecular compounds","crystal structure of human CypA","discovery of CypA inhibitor","series of novel small molecular CypA inhibitors","high CypA PPIase inhibition activities","structure modification","structure similarity","virtual screening","binding activity","binding affinities","binding affinity assay","somewhat inhibition activities","submicro-molar","chemical synthesis","synthesis difficulty","Pharmacological assay","micro-molar level","various biological processes","protein folding","homologous peptidyl prolyl cis","trans isomerases","transportation","assembly","IC50s","conjunction","regulation of neuron growth","family","critical roles","PPIases","proliferation of spleen cells","starting point","database","HIV replication","treatment of immunological disorders","bioassay","study","member of cyclophilins","SPR","SPECS","Abstract Cyclophilin","cyclosporin","CsA","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

However, using conventional diagnostic techniques, a causative agent is not always found. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) allows analysis of the complete virome, but has not yet been applied in COPD exacerbations. Objectives: To study the respiratory virome in nasopharyngeal samples during COPD exacerbations using mNGS. Study design: 88 nasopharyngeal swabs from 63 patients from the Bergen COPD Exacerbation Study (2006-2010) were analysed by mNGS and in-house qPCR for respiratory viruses. Both DNA and RNA were sequenced simultaneously using an Illumina library preparation protocol with in-house adaptations. Results: By mNGS, 23/88 samples tested positive. Sensitivity and specificity were both 96% for diagnostic targets (23/24 and 1067/1120, respectively). Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS were herpes simplex virus type 1 and coronavirus OC43. A positive correlation was found between Cq value and mNGS viral species reads (p=0.008). Patients with viral pathogens had lower percentages of bacteriophages (p\u003C0.000). No correlation was found between viral reads (species and genus level) and clinical markers. Conclusions: The mNGS protocol used was highly sensitive and specific for semi-quantitative detection of respiratory viruses. Excellent negative predictive value implicates the power of mNGS to exclude any infectious cause in one test, with consequences for clinical decision making. Reduced abundance of bacteriophages in COPD patients with viral pathogens implicates skewing of the virome, and speculatively the bacterial population, during infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Rijn, Anneloes L.; van Boheemen, Sander; Carbo, Ellen C.; Pappas, Nikos; Sidorov, Igor; Mei, Hailiang; Aanerud, Marianne; Bakke, Per; Claas, Eric C.J.; Eagan, Tomas M.; Hiemstra, Pieter S.; Kroes, Aloys C.M.; de Vries, Jutte J.C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/509919","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","RNA","Illumina"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mNGS viral species","mNGS protocol","COPD patients","power of mNGS","Viral pathogens","COPD exacerbations","viral reads","viral infections","respiratory virome","Bergen COPD Exacerbation Study","nasopharyngeal samples","complete virome","Study design","positive correlation","semi-quantitative detection of respiratory viruses","Cq value","nasopharyngeal swabs","in-house adaptations","in-house qPCR","clinical markers","bacterial population","diagnostic targets","lower percentages of bacteriophages","Reduced abundance of bacteriophages","clinical decision making","conventional diagnostic techniques","Illumina library preparation protocol","Excellent negative predictive value","mortality","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","herpes simplex virus type","morbidity","genus level","major contributors","consequences","test","important trigger","analysis","skewing","coronavirus OC43","causative agent","generation sequencing","infectious cause","occurrence","Introduction","Metagenomic","RNA","specificity","Objectives","Conclusions","Results","DNA","Sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Here, we used whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-R strains at subcodon resolution. RNASeq facilitated a comparative analysis of viral RNA synthesis and revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-R strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied open reading frame (dORF) located downstream of the nucleocapsid coding region. RiboSeq permitted quantification of the translational efficiency of virus gene expression and identified, for the first time, sites of ribosomal pausing on the genome. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33 to 40%). Triplet phasing of RiboSeq data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two ORFs (ORF4b and ORF4c on sgmRNA IR), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. Analysis of differential gene expression in infected primary chick kidney cells indicated that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with global upregulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. Cellular genes and gene networks differentially expressed during virus infection were also identified, giving insights into the host cell response to IBV infection. IMPORTANCE IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this virus, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in cells infected with both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intraspecies variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms being associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. The numerous cellular genes and gene networks found to be differentially expressed during virus infection provide insights into the host cell response to IBV infection.","publish_time":"2019-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dinan, Adam M.; Keep, Sarah; Bickerton, Erica; Britton, Paul; Firth, Andrew E.; Brierley, Ian","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0db088c90145abdb3d3709fa3beda244c80f100.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f678c06b6289cc9940ffc9f2007bb58c58773563.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6714804.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243124/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00714-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","PRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV infection","IMPORTANCE IBV","IBV isolates","virus infection","gene networks","attenuated forms of IBV","IBV M41-CK","translational efficiency of virus gene expression","Analysis of differential gene expression","understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression","host cell response","improved understanding of IBV molecular biology","translation efficiencies of host genes","RiboSeq data sets","novel transcription junction sites","Triplet phasing of RiboSeq data","avian infectious bronchitis virus","PRF","precise study of transcription","altered production of sgmRNA transcripts","Beau-R strains","novel ribosomally occupied ORFs","level of transcription","high-resolution data","insights","RNASeq","sgmRNA IR","numerous cellular genes","attenuated Beau-R strain","positive-sense RNA genome","genomic RNA ORF1a","sites of ribosomal pausing","ribosomally occupied open reading frame","comparative analysis of viral RNA synthesis","ORF1b junction","precise determination of reading frames","Quantification of reads","global spread","infected primary chick kidney cells","related mRNA transcripts","single nucleotide polymorphisms","major avian pathogen","global upregulation of immune","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","Improved vaccination strategies","signal","considerable intraspecies variation","substantial economic burden","dORF","modest changes","ORF4b","ribosome profiling","nested set of subgenomic mRNAs","sgmRNAs","poultry industry","ORF4c","subcodon resolution","coronaviruses","development of suitable vaccine candidates","transcriptome sequencing","complex replication strategy","time","nucleocapsid coding region"],"language":"en"},

Many cases are often misclassified and underdiagnosed. We conducted a retrospective study on infants to assess how often physicians suspected pertussis and the actual frequency of Bordetella pertussis infections. METHODS: We analyzed all infants with age \u226490 days hospitalized from March 2011 until September 2013 for acute respiratory symptoms tested with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction able to detect Bordetella pertussis and with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for a multipanel respiratory virus. Therefore, we compared patients with pertussis positive aspirate, patients with respiratory virus positive aspirate and patients with negative aspirate to identify symptoms or clinical findings predictive of pertussis. RESULTS: Out of 215 patients analyzed, 53 were positive for pertussis (24.7 %), 119 were positive for respiratory virus (55.3 %) and 43 had a negative aspirate (20 %). Pertussis was suspected in 22 patients at admission and 16 of them were confirmed by laboratory tests, while 37 infants with different admission diagnosis resulted positive for pertussis. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis was 30.2 % and the specificity 96.3 %. Infants with pertussis had more often paroxysmal cough, absence of fever and a higher absolute lymphocyte count than infants without pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis is a serious disease in infants and it is often unrecognized; some features should help pediatricians to suspect pertussis, but clinical suspicion has a low sensitivity. We suggest a systematic use of Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction to support the clinical suspicion of pertussis in patients with less than 3 months of age hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms.","publish_time":"2016-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vittucci, Anna Chiara; Spuri Vennarucci, Valentina; Grandin, Annalisa; Russo, Cristina; Lancella, Laura; Tozzi, Albero Eugenio; Bartuli, Andrea; Villani, Alberto","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab85c4fceac01205bc463599fa6263a6498528c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4986228.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1710-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27528377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella","Pertussis"],"organizations":["Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pertussis positive aspirate","clinical diagnosis of pertussis","clinical suspicion of pertussis","patients","infants","clinical findings predictive of pertussis","respiratory virus positive aspirate","actual frequency of Bordetella pertussis infections","sensitivity of clinical diagnosis","clinical manifestations","acute respiratory symptoms","negative aspirate","multipanel respiratory virus","Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction able","systematic use of Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","different admission diagnosis","different diseases","months of age","low sensitivity","higher absolute lymphocyte count","absence of fever","early infancy","paroxysmal cough","serious disease","pediatricians","physicians","features","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","laboratory tests","retrospective study","days","cases","specificity","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Monitoring sites included an urban subwatershed, a rural subwatershed, and the Milwaukee River at the mouth. To collect samples that characterize variability throughout changing hydrologic periods, a process control system was developed for unattended, large-volume (56\u20132800L) filtration over extended durations. This system provided flow-weighted mean concentrations during runoff and extended (24-h) low-flow periods. Human viruses and bovine viruses were detected by real-time qPCR in 49% and 41% of samples (n=63), respectively. All human viruses analyzed were detected at least once including adenovirus (40% of samples), GI norovirus (10%), enterovirus (8%), rotavirus (6%), GII norovirus (1.6%) and hepatitis A virus (1.6%). Three of seven bovine viruses analyzed were detected including bovine polyomavirus (32%), bovine rotavirus (19%), and bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (5%). Human viruses were present in 63% of runoff samples resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 20% of low-flow samples. Maximum human virus concentrations exceeded 300genomiccopies/L. Bovine viruses were present in 46% of runoff samples resulting from precipitation and snowmelt and 14% of low-flow samples. The maximum bovine virus concentration was 11genomiccopies/L. Statistical modeling indicated that stream flow, precipitation, and season explained the variability of human viruses in the watershed, and hydrologic condition (runoff event or low-flow) and season explained the variability of the sum of human and bovine viruses; however, no model was identified that could explain the variability of bovine viruses alone. Understanding the factors that affect virus fate and transport in rivers will aid watershed management for minimizing human exposure and disease transmission.","publish_time":"2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corsi, S.

This study aimed to characterize the diffusion process of influenza A (H1N1) by identifying the starting point of the epidemic as well as climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the occurrence and intensity of transmission of the disease. The study was carried out in the Brazilian state of Paran\u00E1, where H1N1 caused the largest impact. The units of spatial and temporal analysis were the municipality of residence of the cases and the epidemiological weeks of the year 2009, respectively. Under the Bayesian paradigm, parametric inference was performed through a two-part spatiotemporal model and the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) algorithm. We identified the most likely starting points through the effective distance measure based on mobility networks. The proposed estimation methodology allowed for rapid and efficient implementation of the spatiotemporal model, and provided evidence of different patterns for chance of occurrence and risk of influenza throughout the epidemiological weeks. The results indicate the capital city of Curitiba as the probable starting point, and showed that the interventions that focus on municipalities with greater migration and density of people, especially those with higher Human Development Indexes (HDIs) and the presence of municipal air and road transport, could play an important role in mitigation of effects of future influenza pandemics on public health. These results provide important information on the process of introduction and spread of influenza, and could contribute to the identification of priority areas for surveillance as well as establishment of strategic measures for disease prevention and control. The proposed model also allows identification of epidemiological weeks with high chance of influenza occurrence, which can be used as a reference criterion for creating an immunization campaign schedule.","publish_time":"2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Costa, Ana Carolina Carioca; Code\u00E7o, Cl\u00E1udia Torres; Krainski, Elias Teixeira; Gomes, Marcelo Ferreira da Costa; Nobre, Aline Ara\u00FAjo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f76bdee678e512d5bfb2d3597ad57a1b5d74bc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6122785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180215/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202832","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Development Indexes"],"locations":["Curitiba"],"keyphrases":["risk of influenza","high chance of influenza occurrence","diffusion process of influenza","future influenza pandemics","identification of epidemiological weeks","chance of occurrence","proposed model","two-part spatiotemporal model","H1N1","probable starting point","results","study","high transmissibility","public health","important role","important information","process of introduction","disease prevention","world health authorities","identification of priority areas","proposed estimation methodology","integrated nested Laplace approximation","mitigation of effects","HDIs","establishment of strategic measures","road transport","efficient implementation","effective distance measure","temporal analysis","presence of municipal air","INLA","municipality of residence","surveillance","capital city of Curitiba","major challenge","evidence of different patterns","higher Human Development Indexes","greater migration","density of people","parametric inference","municipalities","mobility networks","algorithm","capacity","control","sociodemographic factors","cases","immunization campaign schedule","Brazilian state of Paran\u00E1","reference criterion","units of spatial","intensity of transmission","Bayesian paradigm","points","interventions","large epidemics","largest impact","year"],"language":"en"},

Human health, animal health (both wildlife and domestic animals), and environmental health are forever bound together. The convergence of people, animals, and the environment defines the parameters of One Health and directs attention to the impact this overlap has on public health, disease detection, and control. One Health (sometimes referred to as One Medicine) is a concept that promotes, improves, and defends the health and well-being of all species through the integration of the sciences of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and environmental studies. As microbiologists, we need to be aware of this One Health concept and how it can positively impact our profession by allowing us to be more productive members of the health care team. There are several things we can do to get started. We can review organism pathogenicity and evaluate and question test results that may signal an unusual event or process that led to a disease. We can be alert to the epidemiologic potential of organism isolates from patients as they may apply to infection control or community epidemiology. We can become familiar with the zoonotic diseases and recognize the etiologic agents associated with wild and domestic animals and apply that knowledge to our diagnostic skills. As we further understand the \u201Cbig picture\u201D of One Health, we can ask strategic questions that can lead us to provide further technical assistance to facilitate earlier interventions that lead to positive patient outcomes and ultimately healthier populations. In human medicine, we generally work with one species of animal. Veterinarians work with all the rest. It is time to communicate with and learn from our veterinary clinical microbiology colleagues and begin to understand the critical nature of the human, animal, and environment interface.

In the present study, two paralogue isoforms of GAPDH mRNAs were characterized from a marine teleost species, rockbream (Oplegnathus fasciatus; Perciformes) and their transcriptional responses to bacterial and viral infections were examined. Rockbream GAPDH1 and GAPDH2 cDNAs encoded 333 and 335 amino acids, respectively, and the amino acid sequence identity between those two isoforms was 74%. Two isoform GAPDH mRNAs were detected ubiquitously in all of tissues examined, but their expression levels were quite variable among tissues. Based on the real-time RT-PCR analysis, the transcription of rbGAPDH1 was affected by neither bacterial (Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum or Streptococcus iniae) nor viral (rockbream iridovirus; RBIV) challenges. However on the contrary, the mRNA expression of rbGAPDH2 was significantly up-regulated in liver resulting from the bacterial infections (up to 25-fold), and in both liver (more than sixfold) and kidney (up to fivefold) from the viral infection. Results in the present study suggest that teleost GAPDH isoforms may also be potentially involved in immune modulations especially with respect to inflammatory responses, which is distinct from its classical glycolytic function.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Young Sun; Lee, Sang Yoon; Kim, Ki Hong; Nam, Yoon Kwon","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a62764b7bba0efd7727d498cac102f991ddf4475.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129407.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464808001630; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2008.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692141/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464808001630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glyceraldehyde","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["GAPDH","Rockbream","RBIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["teleost GAPDH isoforms","viral infections","paralogue isoforms of GAPDH mRNAs","bacterial infections","isoform GAPDH mRNAs","rockbream iridovirus","expression levels","Rockbream GAPDH1","classical glycolytic function","present study","glycolytic metabolism","tissues","liver","mRNA expression of rbGAPDH2","various gene expression studies","transcriptional responses","inflammatory responses","diverse non-glycolytic activities","amino acids","classical housekeeping role","marine teleost species","amino acid sequence identity","Edwardsiella tarda","Vibrio anguillarum","Streptococcus iniae","Oplegnathus fasciatus","invariant internal control","Escherichia coli","Perciformes","multifunctional protein","GAPDH2 cDNAs","real-time RT-PCR analysis","transcription of rbGAPDH1","respect","phosphate dehydrogenase","RBIV","immune modulations","Abstract Glyceraldehyde","challenges","fold","Results","kidney","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A framework for developing European health-based ventilation guidelines was created in 2010\u20132013 in the EU-funded HEALTHVENT project. As a part of the project, the potential efficiency of control policies to health effects caused by residential indoor exposures of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), outdoor bioaerosols, volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon oxide (CO) radon and dampness was estimated. The analysis was based on scenario comparison, using an outdoor-indoor mass-balance model and varying the ventilation rates. Health effects were estimated with burden of diseases (BoD) calculations taking into account asthma, cardiovascular (CV) diseases, acute toxication, respiratory infections, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). RESULTS: The quantitative comparison of three main policy approaches, (i) optimising ventilation rates only; (ii) filtration of outdoor air; and (iii) indoor source control, showed that all three approaches are able to provide substantial reductions in the health risks, varying from approximately 20 % to 44 %, corresponding to 400 000 and 900 000 saved healthy life years in EU-26. PM(2.5) caused majority of the health effects in all included countries, but the importance of the other pollutants varied by country. CONCLUSIONS: The present modelling shows, that combination of controlling the indoor air sources and selecting appropriate ventilation rate was the most effective to reduce health risks. If indoor sources cannot be removed or their emissions cannot be limited to an accepted level, ventilation needs to be increased to remove remaining pollutants. In these cases filtration of outdoor air may be needed to prevent increase of health risks.

The presence of clusters of promiscuous T-cell epitopes, immunological hotspots, has been observed in several antigens. These clusters may be exploited to facilitate the development of epitope-based vaccines by selecting a small number of hotspots that can elicit all of the required T-cell activation functions. Given the large size of pathogen proteomes, including of variant strains, computational tools are necessary for automated screening and selection of immunological hotspots. RESULTS: Hotspot Hunter is a web-based computational system for large-scale screening and selection of candidate immunological hotspots in pathogen proteomes through analysis of antigenic diversity. It allows screening and selection of hotspots specific to four common HLA supertypes, namely HLA class I A2, A3, B7 and class II DR. The system uses Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine methods as predictive engines. Soft computing principles were employed to integrate the prediction results produced by both methods for robust prediction performance. Experimental validation of the predictions showed that Hotspot Hunter can successfully identify majority of the real hotspots. Users can predict hotspots from a single protein sequence, or from a set of aligned protein sequences representing pathogen proteome. The latter feature provides a global view of the localizations of the hotspots in the proteome set, enabling analysis of antigenic diversity and shift of hotspots across protein variants. The system also allows the integration of prediction results of the four supertypes for identification of hotspots common across multiple supertypes. The target selection feature of the system shortlists candidate peptide hotspots for the formulation of an epitope-based vaccine that could be effective against multiple variants of the pathogen and applicable to a large proportion of the human population. CONCLUSION: Hotspot Hunter is publicly accessible at . It is a new generation computational tool aiding in epitope-based vaccine design.","publish_time":"2008-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Guang Lan; Khan, Asif M; Srinivasan, Kellathur N; Heiny, AT; Lee, KX; Kwoh, Chee Keong; August, J Thomas; Brusic, Vladimir","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d77dcb77a4a620fd1de81f309bff0e04e2578272.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2259420.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-s1-s19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18315850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hotspot Hunter"],"organizations":["HLA","Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selection of immunological hotspots","shift of hotspots","real hotspots","selection of hotspots specific","selection of candidate immunological hotspots","identification of hotspots common","small number of hotspots","system shortlists candidate peptide hotspots","computational system","multiple supertypes","based vaccines","Hotspot Hunter","common HLA supertypes","HLA class","large size of pathogen proteomes","development of epitope","epitope-based vaccine design","multiple variants","large proportion","protein variants","human population","target selection feature","integration of prediction results","promiscuous T-cell epitopes","computational tools","automated screening","large-scale screening","analysis of antigenic diversity","multiple alleles","proteome set","development of vaccines","required T-cell activation functions","set of aligned protein sequences","human leukocyte antigen","single protein sequence","robust prediction performance","presence of clusters","new generation computational tool aiding","Support Vector Machine methods","Artificial Neural Network","formulation","prime targets","variant strains","A2","web","predictive engines","A3","B7","immunotherapies","predictions","localizations","majority","global view","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","Experimental validation","Soft computing principles","Users","antigens"],"language":"en"},

The M protein is predicted to contain a triple-spanning transmembrane (TM) region, a single N-glycosylation site near its N-terminus that is in the exterior of the virion, and a long C-terminal region in the interior. The M protein harbors a higher substitution rate (0.6% correlated to its size) among viral open reading frames (ORFs) from published data. The four substitutions detected in the M protein, which cause non-synonymous changes, can be classified into three types. One of them results in changes of pI (isoelectric point) and charge, affecting antigenicity. The second changes hydrophobicity of the TM region, and the third one relates to hydrophilicity of the interior structure. Phylogenetic tree building based on the variations of the M protein appears to support the non-human origin of SARS-CoV. To investigate its immunogenicity, we synthesized eight oligopeptides covering 69.2% of the entire ORF and screened them by using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with sera from SARS patients.

Viral infection is associated with both direct (invasive disease) and indirect (immune modulation) effects affecting susceptibility to other infections and promoting allograft rejection. The transplantation recipient is susceptible to a broad array of viral pathogens. Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections.

Therefore we have chosen this region for designed a set of RT-LAMP primers for CVB3 detection. For this the total RNA was extracted from 24-h post infected-HeLa cells with complete cytopathic effect (CPE), and applied to a one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction (RT-LAMP) using CVB3-specific primers. The optimization of RT-LAMP reaction was carried out with three variables factors including MgSO4 concentration, temperature and time of incubation. Amplification was analyzed by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide and SYBR Green staining. Our results were shown the ladder-like pattern of the VP1 gene amplification. The LAMP reaction mix was optimized and the best result observed at 4mM MgSO4 and 60\u00B0C for 90min incubation. RT-LAMP had high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CVB3 infection. This method can be used as a rapid and easy diagnostic test for detection of CVB3 in clinical laboratories.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monazah, A.; Zeinoddini, M.; Saeeidinia, A.

Lipid rafts, enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol and associated proteins, are special plasma membrane microdomains involved in several processes in viral infections. The extraction of cholesterol leads to disorganization of lipid microdomains and to dissociation of proteins bound to lipid rafts. Because cholesterol-rich microdomains appear to be a general feature of the entry mechanism of non-eneveloped viruses and of several coronaviruses, the purpose of this study was to analyse the contribution of lipids to the infectivity of canine coronavirus (CCoV). The CCoV life cycle is closely connected to plasma membrane cholesterol, from cell entry to viral particle production. The methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD) was employed to remove cholesterol and to disrupt the lipid rafts. Cholesterol depletion from the cell membrane resulted in a dose-dependent reduction, but not abolishment, of virus infectivity, and at a concentration of 15 mM, the reduction in the infection rate was about 68 %. M\u03B2CD treatment was used to verify if cholesterol in the envelope was required for CCoV infection. This resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect, and at a concentration of 9 mM M\u03B2CD, infectivity was reduced by about 73 %. Since viral entry would constitute a target for antiviral strategies, inhibitory molecules interacting with viral and/or cell membranes, or interfering with lipid metabolism, may have strong antiviral potential. It will be interesting in the future to analyse the membrane microdomains in the CCoV envelope.","publish_time":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pratelli, Annamaria; Colao, Valeriana","journal":"Journal of General Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0577133820c40886abb823081b969453471734f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.070870-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lipid rafts","plasma membrane cholesterol","disorganization of lipid microdomains","lipid metabolism","lipid composition","lipid synthesis","cholesterol-rich microdomains","Cholesterol depletion","extraction of cholesterol","viral entry","cell entry","CCoV envelope","CCoV infection","special plasma membrane microdomains","viral infections","cell membranes","Coronaviruses","viral particle production","concentration","dose-dependent reduction","virus infectivity","CCoV life cycle","M\u03B2CD treatment","dose-dependent inhibitory effect","infectivity of canine coronavirus","entry mechanism of non-eneveloped viruses","associated proteins","dissociation of proteins","antiviral strategies","inhibitory molecules","infection rate","enveloped RNA viruses","strong antiviral potential","target","complex relationships","general feature","processes","sphingolipids","host cells","abolishment","signalling","contribution of lipids","study","methyl-\u03B2","cyclodextrin","future","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Almost 25 years later, Richard Pattle, John Clements and Chris Macklin, each working on the effects of nerve gases on the lungs, contributed to the understanding of the physiology of pulmonary surfactant. About 5 years later Mary Ellen Avery and Jere Mead published convincing evidence that preterm neonates dying of hyaline membrane disease (respiratory distress syndrome, RDS) had a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. The first trials of nebulized synthetic (protein-free) surfactant to prevent RDS were published soon after Patrick Bouvier Kennedy (son of President John F Kennedy) died of this disorder after treatment in Boston. These trials were unsuccessful; however, Goran Enhorning and Bengt Robertson in the early 1970s demonstrated that natural surfactants (containing proteins) were effective in an immature rabbit model of RDS. Soon after this Forrest Adams showed that a natural surfactant was also effective in an immature lamb model. Working with him was Tetsuro Fujiwara who 2 years later, after returning to Japan, published the seminal article reporting the responses of 10 preterm infants with RDS to a bolus of modified bovine surfactant. During the 1980s there were numerous randomized controlled trials of many different natural and synthetic surfactants, demonstrating reductions in pulmonary air leaks and neonatal mortality. Subsequently natural surfactants were shown to be superior to the protein-free synthetic products. Recently there have been a number of randomized trials comparing different natural surfactant preparations. Commercially available bovine surfactants may have similar efficacy but there is some evidence that a porcine surfactant used to treat RDS with an initial dose of 200 mg per kg is more effective than a bovine surfactant used in an initial dose of 100 mg per kg. Bovine and porcine surfactants have not been compared in trials of prophylaxis. Very recently a new synthetic surfactant with a surfactant protein mimic has been compared with other commercially available natural and synthetic surfactants in two trials. The new surfactant may be superior to one of the older protein-free synthetic surfactants but there is no evidence of its superiority over established natural products and it is currently not approved for clinical use. A number of other new synthetic surfactants have been tested in animal models or in treatment of adults with ARDS, but so far there have been no reports of treatment of neonatal RDS. Natural surfactants work best if given by a rapid bolus into the lungs but less invasive methods such as a laryngeal mask, pharyngeal deposition or rapid extubation to CPAP have showed promise. Unfortunately, delivery of surfactant by nebulization has so far been ineffective. Surfactant treatment has been tried in a number of other neonatal respiratory disorders but only infants with meconium aspiration seem to benefit although larger and more frequent doses are probably needed to demonstrate improved lung function. A surfactant protocol based upon early treatment and CPAP is suggested for very preterm infants. Earlier treatment may improve survival rates for these infants; however, there is a risk of increasing the prevalence of milder forms of chronic lung disease. Nevertheless, surfactant therapy has been a major contribution to care of the preterm newborn during the past 25 years.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halliday, H L","journal":"J Perinatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddf79f6b7bb8a5d5947e219cb10071f3034dc4dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104445.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kurt von Neergaard","Richard Pattle","John Clements","Chris Macklin","Mary Ellen Avery","Jere Mead","Patrick Bouvier Kennedy","John F Kennedy","Goran Enhorning","Bengt Robertson","Forrest Adams","Tetsuro Fujiwara"],"organizations":["RDS","CPAP"],"locations":["Boston"],"keyphrases":["Surfactant treatment","new surfactant","natural surfactants","surfactant protocol","surfactant therapy","delivery of surfactant","surfactant protein mimic","presence of pulmonary surfactant","deficiency of pulmonary surfactant","physiology of pulmonary surfactant","different natural surfactant preparations","new synthetic surfactants","bolus of modified bovine surfactant","porcine surfactants","available bovine surfactants","older protein-free synthetic surfactants","trials of nebulized synthetic","preterm infants","protein-free synthetic products","early treatment","years","number of randomized trials","established natural products","trials of prophylaxis","treatment of adults","Earlier treatment","reports of treatment","preterm neonates","preterm newborn","numerous randomized controlled trials","convincing evidence","CPAP","neonatal respiratory disorders","pulmonary air leaks","rapid bolus","neonatal mortality","lungs","working","initial dose","immature rabbit model of","immature lamb model","John Clements","rapid extubation","son of President John F Kennedy","hyaline membrane disease","respiratory distress syndrome","Patrick Bouvier Kennedy","prevalence of milder forms of chronic lung disease","improved lung function","Jere Mead","reductions","laryngeal mask","Chris Macklin","pharyngeal deposition","Mary Ellen Avery","Richard Pattle","major contribution","Goran Enhorning","Bengt Robertson","experiments","relevance","responses","similar efficacy","invasive methods","meconium aspiration","effects of nerve gases","animal models","care","survival rates","superiority","understanding","proteins","seminal article","Forrest Adams","Neergaard","Japan","promise","nebulization","newborn\u0027s","frequent doses","Kurt","breath","risk","Tetsuro Fujiwara","ARDS","Boston","clinical use"],"language":"en"},

Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1 year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40 years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing. Changes in the immune response to viral infections in genetically predisposed individuals are very likely to be the main factors involved in the association between viral infection and asthma.","publish_time":"2016-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luz Garcia-Garcia, M.; Calvo Rey, Cristina; del Rosal Rabes, Teresa","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5399231d85b304d316778dbe87a845d81db311a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105201.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory viral infections","respiratory syncytial virus","type of respiratory virus","common acute respiratory infection","chronic respiratory symptoms","small children","association","pathogenic role of respiratory viruses","particular rhinovirus","onset of wheezing","causative agent of bronchiolitis","common causes of exacerbation","episode of wheezing","RSV accounts","common cause of hospitalization","development of recurrent wheezing","year of age","age group","main factors","importance risk factors","triggers","exacerbations","immune response","predisposed individuals","genetic predisposition","adenovirus","infants","sufficient evidence","asthmatic patients","long term","existence","Changes","metapneumovirus","bocavirus","marker","cases","years"],"language":"en"},

In the preparation of live vaccines, reverse genetics s-ystems allow the direct modification of the specific regions in the genomes of negative-stranded RNA viruses concerned with attenuation; the ultimate goal is the introduction of site-specific mutations through a cDNA intermediate in order to develop strains with the requisite attenuation, antigenic and growth properties needed in a vaccine. These techniques can also be used to disarm potentially highly pathogenic viruses, such as emerging H5N1 avian influenza viruses, in order to facilitate large-scale preparation of viruses for use in inactivated vaccines under conditions of manufacturing safety.

The objective of the study was to validate whether patients with higher serum PCT concentrations have a higher incidence of ARDS. METHODS: The study was a prospective, single-center, observational cohort study. All patients who received cardiac surgery with CPB were screened for study eligibility. Patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort or the control cohort according to serum PCT concentration on the first postoperative day with a cut-off value of 7.0 ng/mL. Patients were followed up until the 7th postoperative day. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ARDS, which was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were enrolled, 64 patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort and 232 patients were assigned to the control cohort. PCT concentration was 16.23 \u00B1 5.9 ng/mL in the PCT-elevated cohort, and 2.70 \u00B1 1.43 ng/mL in the control cohort (p \u003C 0.001). The incidence of ARDS was significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (21.9% versus 5.6%, p \u003C 0.001). The incidence of moderate-to-severe ARDS was also significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (10.9% versus 0.4%, p \u003C 0.001). The hazard ratio of ARDS at 7 days in the PCT-elevated cohort, as compared with the control cohort, was 6.8 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 17.4). The hazard ratio of moderate-to-severe ARDS in the PCT-elevated cohort was 57.3 (95% confidence interval 10.4 to 316.3). The positive predictive value of PCT for ARDS and moderate-to-severe ARDS were 0.242 and 0.121, respectively; the negative predictive value of PCT for ARDS and moderate-to-severe ARDS were 0.952 and 1.0, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cardiac surgical patients with elevated PCT concentration have a higher incidence of ARDS.

Demographic and clinical data were recorded, including cancer specifics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes. Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Time to weaning was analyzed using the cumulative incidence function, with death considered a competing risk. Prognostic factors were evaluated for use in prospective evaluations of weaning protocols. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, 122 patients required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting with weaning as a goal of care. The cumulative incidence of weaning after discharge from the intensive care unit was 42% at 21 days, 49% at 30 days, 58% at 60 days, 61% at 90 days, and 61% at 120 days.

Overall, with a median follow-up of 140 days (range, 0\u2013425 days; average, 141 days), 25% of patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation (9 of 36) are alive. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients can be weaned from long-term mechanical ventilation, even after prolonged periods of support. Implementation of a resource-intensive weaning program did not improve rates of successful weaning. No clear time on mechanical ventilation could be identified beyond which weaning was unprecedented. Short-term overall survival for these patients is poor.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haviland, Kelly; Tan, Kay See; Schwenk, Nadja; Pillai, Manju V.; Stover, Diane E.; Downey, Robert J.","journal":"BMC Palliat Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3752c061cb970615bc6fa81b3a892cd77a94415d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","probability of weaning","long-term mechanical ventilation","overall survival of cancer patients","long-term survival","cumulative incidence of weaning","specialized weaning unit","ventilated cancer patients","rates of successful weaning","critical care setting","goal of care","median survival","Short-term overall survival","resource-intensive weaning program","prospective evaluations of weaning protocols","intensive care unit","years","single-institution retrospective review of patients","cancer specifics","cumulative incidence function","median follow-up","clear time","incomplete information available","use","discharge","death","therapeutic decisions","comorbidities","treatments","range","prolonged periods of support","clinical data","METHODS","Implementation","Kaplan-Meier approach","competing risk","Prognostic factors","outcomes","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","average","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It is known that egg production decreases over time, while animal maintenance costs remain stable. It would, however, be desirable to keep hens as long as possible to obtain maximal amounts of antibodies. To identify a suitable length of time that animals can be kept and to optimize the cost:yield ratio, we monitored the number of eggs laid, the total amount of chicken IgY, and the specific antibody titer from individually prepared eggs over a 2-yr period. The plant toxin ricin and the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins type A and B were used to immunize 4 chickens. The number of eggs laid in 2 yr was approximately 600 per hen (about 80% of the maximum egg number), yielding about 20 to 40 g of total IgY per hen. A stable antibody titer of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000, as measured by ELISA, was obtained following up to 11 injections of 10 to 20 \u03BCg of immobilized native toxin. Laying capacities were found to decrease, on average, from 7 eggs/wk at the point of first immunization to 2 eggs/wk after more than 2 yr. In parallel, the yield of total and specific IgY increased over time, so that the antibody recovery remained high, even after prolonged immunization times. Using purified IgY preparations, classical immunological assays such as ELISA and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, the IgY showed neutralizing capacity when used to block the functional activity of the toxins both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the total IgY content over time demonstrated a complex biological oscillation (and the antigen-specific titer), with a shorter time period of around 7 d (circaseptan rhythm). In summary, we successfully immunized chickens with ricin and botulinum neurotoxins and monitored laying capacity, IgY concentration, and specific antibody titer over an extended period of 2 yr.","publish_time":"2009-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pauly, D.; Dorner, M.; Zhang, X.; Hlinak, A.; Dorner, B.; Schade, R.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a511f79020b10592f2cc3e5596527608b1160358.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific antibody titer","number of eggs","yield of total","stable antibody titer","antigen-specific titer","shorter time period","prepared eggs","antibody recovery","yr period","g of total","suitable length of time","immunized chickens","high yield of antibodies obtainable","yield ratio","extended period","laying capacity","wk","ELISA","maximum egg number","plant toxin ricin","prolonged immunization times","Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins type","neutralizing capacity","egg production decreases","maximal amounts of antibodies","\u03BCg of immobilized native toxin","classical immunological assays","complex biological oscillation","animal maintenance costs","content","concentration","preparations","point","Western blotting","animals","key benefits","functional activity","circaseptan rhythm","hens","summary","Analysis","average","injections","capacities"],"language":"en"},

We prospectively enrolled children (\u003C16 years old) hospitalized with RTI and asymptomatic controls (2006\u20132015). Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for HMPV, RSV, and 17 other pathogens. We genotyped HMPV-positive samples and assessed shedding time in 32 HMPV-infected children. RESULTS. In children with RTI, HMPV was detected in 7.3% (267 of 3650) and RSV in 28.7% (1048 of 3650). Among controls, 2.1% (7 of 339) had low HMPV levels detected by PCR, but all were culture negative. HMPV primarily occurred from January to April and in regular epidemics. At least 2 HMPV subtypes occurred each season. The average annual hospitalization rates in children \u003C5 years old with lower RTI were 1.9/1000 (HMPV) and 10.4/1000 (RSV).

Against this backdrop, the discovery of RNA repair in modern cells is timely food for thought and brings us conceptually one step closer to understanding how RNA genomes were replaced by DNA genomes. We have examined the available literature on multisubunit RNA polymerase structure and function and conclude that a strong case can be made that the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) possessed a repair-competent RNA polymerase, which would have been capable of acting on an RNA genome.

The MinION Oxford Nanopore sequencer allows sequencing long reads, with the potential of sequencing complete genes, and even complete genomes of viruses, in individual reads. However, MinION suffers from high error rates, rendering the detection of true variants difficult. Here, we propose a new statistical approach named AssociVar, which differentiates between true mutations and sequencing errors from direct RNA/DNA sequencing using MinION. Our strategy relies on the assumption that sequencing errors will be dispersed randomly along sequencing reads, and hence will not be associated with each other, whereas real mutations will display a non-random pattern of association with other mutations. We demonstrate our approach using direct RNA sequencing data from evolved populations of the MS2 bacteriophage, whose small genome makes it ideal for MinION sequencing. AssociVar inferred several mutations in the phage genome, which were corroborated using parallel Illumina sequencing. This allowed us to reconstruct full genome viral haplotypes constituting different strains that were present in the sample. Our approach is applicable to long read sequencing data from any organism for accurate detection of bona fide mutations and inter-strain polymorphisms.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harel, Noam; Meir, Moran; Gophna, Uri; Stern, Adi","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62849403026ca46d1e2064171080770d41f94c9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzcxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MinION sequencing","sequencing reads","sequencing errors","DNA sequencing","sequencing long reads","generation sequencing data","direct RNA sequencing data","parallel Illumina sequencing","long read sequencing data","potential of sequencing complete genes","true mutations","real mutations","small genome","genome viral haplotypes","phage genome","individual reads","AssociVar","MinION Oxford Nanopore sequencer","new statistical approach","accurate detection of","inference of haplotypes","detection of true variants difficult","complete genomes of viruses","evolved populations","organism","MS2 bacteriophage","different strains","field of genetics","high error rates","non-random pattern of association","inter-strain polymorphisms","key challenges","sample","assumption","strategy"],"language":"en"},

As diagnostic tests such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction become more widely used, the relative importance of additional viruses (such as parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus) will likely increase. Influenza virus should be considered as a cause of pneumonia during the winter months, especially during periods of peak activity. Patients with high-grade fever, myalgias, and cough should arouse the highest suspicion. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia should also be suspected during the winter in patients with coryza, wheezing, low-grade fever, and patchy infiltrates, especially if negative for influenza on rapid testing.

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are responsible for considerable morbidity in the community, but little is known about the presence of respiratory pathogens in asymptomatic individuals. We hypothesized that asymptomatic persons could have a subclinical infection and thus act as a source of transmission. Methods. During the period of 2000\u20132003, all patients with ARTI who visited their sentinel general practitioner had their data reported to estimate the incidence of ARTI in Dutch general practices. A random selection of these patients (case patients) and an equal number of asymptomatic persons visiting for other complaints (control subjects) were included in a case-control study. Nose and throat swabs of participants were tested for a broad range of pathogens. Results. The overall incidence of ARTI was 545 cases per 10,000 person-years, suggesting that, in the Dutch population, an estimated 900,000 persons annually consult their general practitioner for respiratory complaints. Rhinovirus was most common in case patients (24%), followed by influenza virus type A (11%) and coronavirus (7%). Viruses were detected in 58% of the case patients, \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci group A were detected in 11%, and mixed infections were detected in 3%. Pathogens were detected in \u223C30% of control subjects, particularly in the youngest age groups. Conclusion. This study confirms that most ARTIs are viral and supports the reserved policy of prescribing antibiotics. In both case and control subjects, rhinovirus was the most common pathogen. Of bacterial infections, only group A \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci were more common in case patients than in control subjects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that asymptomatic persons might be a neglected source of transmission.","publish_time":"2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B.; Heijnen, Marie-Louise A.; Bartelds, Aad I.M.; Peters, Marcel F.; van der Plas, Simone M.; Wilbrink, Berry","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42527efa8f07be148d1efc4f7b1bdefc3a3e7520.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case patients","control subjects","case-control study","equal number of asymptomatic persons","asymptomatic individuals","respiratory complaints","presence of respiratory pathogens","ARTIs","sentinel general practitioner","\u03B2-hemolytic streptococci group","Dutch general practices","overall incidence of ARTI","Rhinovirus","Acute respiratory tract infections","common pathogen","bacterial infections","mixed infections","neglected source of transmission","broad range of pathogens","Dutch population","cases","considerable morbidity","data","reserved policy of prescribing antibiotics","throat swabs of participants","subclinical infection","random selection","Nose","community","youngest age groups","person-years","influenza virus type","Background","Methods","period","Results","coronavirus","Viruses","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Specific proteomic patterns might be present in serum in response to the infection and could be useful for early detection of the disease. Methods: Using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) ProteinChip technology, we profiled and compared serum proteins of 39 patients with early-stage SARS infection and 39 non-SARS patients who were suspected cases during the SARS outbreak period. Proteomic patterns associated with SARS were identified by bioinformatic and biostatistical analyses. Features of interest were then purified and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Twenty proteomic features were significantly different between the 2 groups. Fifteen were increased in the SARS group, and 5 were decreased. Their concentrations were correlated with 2 or more clinical and/or biochemical variables. Two were correlated with the SARS-CoV viral load. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that a majority of the SARS patients (95%) had similar serum proteomic profiles and identified 2 subgroups with poor prognosis. ROC curve analysis identified individual features as potential biomarkers for SARS diagnosis (areas under ROC curves, 0.733\u20130.995). ROC curve areas were largest for an N-terminal fragment of complement C3c \u03B1 chain (m/z 28 119) and an internal fragment of fibrinogen \u03B1-E chain (m/z 5908). Immunoglobulin \u03BA light chain (m/z 24 505) positively correlated with viral load. Conclusions: Specific proteomic fingerprints in the sera of adult SARS patients could be used to identify SARS cases early during onset with high specificity and sensitivity.","publish_time":"2006-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pang, Ronald TK; Poon, Terence CW; Chan, KC Allen; Lee, Nelson LS; Chiu, Rossa WK; Tong, Yu-Kwan; Wong, Ronald MY; Chim, Stephen SC; Ngai, Sai M; Sung, Joseph JY; Lo, YM Dennis","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29db5c5ee576aa04ff7807287ee91b2ca42a5cff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS cases","SARS diagnosis","SARS group","non-SARS patients","SARS outbreak period","sera of adult SARS patients","early-stage SARS infection","SARS-CoV viral load","proteomic features","Specific proteomic patterns","Specific proteomic fingerprints","similar serum proteomic profiles","ROC curve areas","ROC curve analysis","individual features","serum proteins","ROC curves","early detection","internal fragment of fibrinogen \u03B1-E chain","N-terminal fragment of complement C3c \u03B1 chain","suspected cases","Immunoglobulin \u03BA light chain","emerging infectious disease","Hierarchical clustering analysis","potential biomarkers","ionization","SELDI","new coronavirus strain","surface-enhanced laser desorption","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","subgroups","onset","majority","high specificity","Background","ProteinChip technology","sensitivity","Methods","response","bioinformatic","Conclusions","poor prognosis","biostatistical analyses","tandem mass spectrometry","biochemical variables","Results","concentrations"],"language":"en"},

However, the impact of HIV-1 viremia on CCL2 regulation is largely unknown. We utilized a DNA oligonucleotide microarray covering 110 inflammatory genes. Five genes were induced by at least 2-fold in PBMCs of HIV-1 viremic (\u003E100.000 RNA copies ml(\u22121)) as compared with aviremic (\u003C50 RNA copies ml(\u22121)) individuals. These genes were CCL2, CXC chemokine ligand-10, IFN-\u03B3, GTP-cyclohydrolase-1 and C-C chemokine receptor-1. In addition to microarray data verification by real-time PCR, analysis of independent patient samples revealed a similar expression pattern. CCL2 was the most strongly regulated gene at mRNA level and its serum concentration was significantly elevated in viremic compared with aviremic and HIV-1 seronegative controls, indicating a positive correlation between viremia and CCL2. Flow cytometric studies demonstrated a higher percentage of CCL2-expressing CD14\u002B monocytes in viremic compared with aviremic individuals. These results suggest a highly restricted modulation of host inflammatory gene response by HIV. Genes up-regulated in the viremic state, in particular CCL2, presumably serve as potential enhancing factors in HIV-1 replication, represented by high viral load in HIV-1 viremic patients.

During the initial period of the epidemic, public communication was effected through press releases and media coverage of the epidemic. About a month into the epidemic, a public education campaign was mounted to educate Singaporeans on SARS and adoption of appropriate behaviours to prevent the spread of the disease. A survey was conducted in late April 2003 to assess Singaporeans\u0027 knowledge about SARS and infection control measures, and their concerns and anxiety in relation to the outbreak. The survey also sought to assess their confidence in the ability of various institutions to deal with SARS and their opinion on the seemingly tough measures enforced. The study involved 853 adults selected from a telephone-sampling frame. Stratified sampling was used to ensure adequate representation from major ethnic groups and age groups. The study showed that the overall knowledge about SARS and control measures undertaken was low (mean per cent score of 24.5 \u00B1 8.9%). While 82% of respondents expressed confidence in measures undertaken by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (the hospital designated to manage SARS), only 36% had confidence in nursing homes. However, \u003E80% of the public agreed that the preventive and control measures instituted were appropriate. Despite the low knowledge score, the overall mean satisfaction score of the government\u0027s response to SARS was 4.47 (out of possible highest score of 5.00), with \u003E93% of adult Singaporeans indicating that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the government\u0027s response to SARS. Generally, Singaporeans had a high level of public trust (satisfaction with government, confidence in institutions, deeming government measures appropriate), scoring 11.4 out of possible maximum of 14. The disparity between low knowledge on the one hand and high confidence and trust in the actions of the government on the other suggests that Singaporeans do not require high knowledge sufficiency to be confident in measures undertaken by the government to control the SARS crisis.","publish_time":"2005-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deurenberg-Yap, M.; Foo, L.

BO is a relatively rare disease, but its incidence is probably higher than generally believed and is continuously rising, partly because of better recognition, but also because of increased exposure to industrial fumes, and its occurrence in lung transplantation. BO is characterized histologically by varying degrees of obliteration of the lumen of the respiratory bronchioles by organizing connective tissue often extending into the alveoli (\u2018proliferative\u2019 BO with organizing pneumoni\u002BBOOP) or by more extensive fibrosis and scarring of the more proximal, conductive bronchioles (\u2018constrictive\u2019 BO). Diverse clinical conditions have been associated with the development of BO, notably viral and mycoplasma infection, toxic fume exposure and immune reactions in the setting of a collagen vascular disease, drug reaction or organ transplantation. The clinical course and features of BO may vary considerably according to the aetiology, histological pattern and stage of the disease. The most common presentation is that of a progressive dry cough and dyspnea, associated with diffuse patchy interstitial lung infiltrates on chest X-ray. In the more advanced cases, lung function tests show either restrictive or obstructive defects, depending on the extent of alveolar involvement, and hypoxemia without CO(2) retention. The diagnosis is often possible on clinical grounds, however, in a seriously ill patient uncertainty should be resolved by tissue diagnosis, preferably by open lung biopsy. Treatment is based on symptomatic therapy. The use of corticosteroids is controversial, but common. Patients with BOOP are exceptional, in that there may be no underlying condition (\u2018idiopathic\u2019 BOOP or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia\u2014COP), a restrictive ventilatory defect is usual and the response to corticosteroids often remarkable.","publish_time":"1994-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"EZRI, T.; KUNICHEZKY, S.; ELIRAZ, A.; SOROKER, D.; HALPERIN, D.; SCHATTNER, A.","journal":"QJM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdfcb9d95b9b800dab273ab03289cf301ee89c8d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzkxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["BO"],"organizations":["BOOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of BO","features of BO","BOOP","clinical manifestations","lung transplantation","clinical grounds","clinical course","tissue diagnosis","Diverse clinical conditions","lung function tests","open lung biopsy","rare disease","treatment of patients","collagen vascular disease","cryptogenic organizing pneumonia","diffuse patchy interstitial lung infiltrates","increased exposure","respiratory bronchioles","connective tissue","conductive bronchioles","organ transplantation","use of corticosteroids","common presentation","toxic fume exposure","restrictive ventilatory defect","mycoplasma infection","dyspnea","immune reactions","drug reaction","setting","emphasis","chest X-ray","bronchiolitis obliterans","response","lumen","pathological correlations","obstructive defects","industrial fumes","progressive dry cough","hypoxemia","histological pattern","stage","varying degrees of obliteration","advanced cases","recent developments","occurrence","alveoli","extent of alveolar involvement","current concepts","aetiology","ill patient uncertainty","incidence","underlying condition","better recognition","extensive fibrosis","symptomatic therapy","retention"],"language":"en"},

To determine the prevalence of MCPyV in 305 respiratory samples from immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and evaluate their contribution to respiratory diseases, specimens were screened for MCPyV using single, multiplex, or real\u2010time PCR; co\u2010infection with other viruses was examined. Of the 305 samples tested, 10 (3.27%) were positive for MCPyV. The virus was found in two groups of patients: in 6 (2%) nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from children aged 26 days to 7 months who were immunocompetent; and in 4 (1.3%) of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples taken from patients aged 41 to 69 years who were severely immunosuppressed from leukemia or transplant therapy.

POCT development has seldom been guided by explicitly identified clinical need and requirements of the intended users. Approaches for identifying POCT priorities and developing target product profiles (TPPs) for POCTs in primary medical care are not well developed, and there is no published TPP for a CA-LRTI POCT aimed at developed countries. METHODS: We conducted workshops with expert stakeholders and a survey with primary care clinicians to produce a target product profile (TPP) to guide the development of a clinically relevant and technologically feasible POCT for CA-LRTI. RESULTS: Participants with clinical, academic, industrial, technological and basic scientific backgrounds contributed to four expert workshops, and 45 practicing primary care clinicians responded to an online survey and prioritised community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as the CA-LRTI where a new POCT was most urgently needed. Consensus was reached on a TPP document that included information on the intended niche in the clinical pathway in primary medical care; diagnostic product specification (intended use statement and test concept), and minimum and ideal user specifications. Clinicians minimum requirements of a CA-LRTI POCT included the use of minimally invasive samples, a result in less than 30 minutes, no more than a single preparation step, minimum operational requirements, and detection of common respiratory pathogens and their resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary, multistage partnership approach generated a clinically-driven TPP for guiding the development of a new POCT, and this approach as well as the TPP itself may be useful to others developing a new POCT.","publish_time":"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gal, Micaela; Francis, Nicholas A.; Hood, Kerenza; Villacian, Jorge; Goossens, Herman; Watkins, Angela; Butler, Christopher C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcc0736f4bc12d50362c4b9c2800565eeb9738ca.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8cf8d814e606bfe6f9a49383fab09c84dd60a2f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6070214.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CA-LRTI POCT","new POCT","POCT development","primary care clinicians","POCT priorities","feasible POCT","primary medical care of community","Clinicians minimum requirements","TPP document","driven TPP","published TPP","Point of care tests","minimum operational requirements","target product profiles","clinical pathway","expert workshops","clinical need","POCTs","intended niche","intended users","diagnostic product specification","online survey","prioritised community","use statement","expert stakeholders","developed countries","multistage partnership approach","lower respiratory tract infections","detection of common respiratory pathogens","basic scientific backgrounds","TPPs","single preparation step","resistance","test concept","pneumonia","CAP","Participants","information","invasive samples","ideal user specifications","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","prescribed antibiotics","minutes","METHODS","Consensus","Approaches"],"language":"en"},

Herein we investigated the role of Sirtuin and Forkhead box O (FOXO) families in this experimental model using Nortern Blot and Western Blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that mitochondrial SIRT3 and SIRT4 protein expression increased from 12 and 24 h post infection (p.i.) onwards, respectively, whereas the nuclear SIRT1 expression increased during the first 12 h p.i. followed by a decrease after 36 h p.i., reaching the same level of control at 48 h p.i. Sirtuins interact with/and regulate the activity of FOXO family proteins, and we herein observed that FOXO3A and FOXO1 expression increased significantly and stably from 12 h p.i. onwards. In addition, CCoV-II induces a remarkable increase in the expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), while we observed a slight up-regulation of FasL/Fas at 36 p.i. with a decrease of both proteins at the end of infection. Furthermore, we found that virus infection increased both bax translocation into mitochondria and decreased bcl-2 expression in cytosol in a time-dependent manner. These data suggest that FOXO transcription factors mediate pro-apoptotic effects of CCoV-II, in part due to activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while some Sirtuin family members (such as SIRT3 and SIRT4) may be involved in intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, these results propose that TRAIL is an important mediator of cell death induced by CCoV-II during in vitro infection.","publish_time":"2011-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marf\u00E8, Gabriella; Tafani, Marco; Fiorito, Filomena; Pagnini, Ugo; Iovane, Giuseppe; De Martino, Luisa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3210785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22087287/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027313","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FOXO","FasL/Fas"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h post infection","expression of TNF","FOXO1 expression","intrinsic apoptotic pathway","SIRT4 protein expression","virus infection","end of infection","nuclear SIRT1 expression","pro-apoptotic effects of CCoV","activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway","activity of FOXO family proteins","TRAIL","results","FOXO transcription factors","Sirtuin family members","Nortern Blot","canine fibrosarcoma cell line","role of Sirtuin","related apoptosis","mitochondrial SIRT3","Western Blot analysis","canine coronavirus type","important mediator of cell death","families","experimental model","bax translocation","cytosol","decreased bcl","Forkhead box O","ligand","remarkable increase","time-dependent manner","regulation of FasL","data","level of control","previous study","cells","Sirtuins","FOXO3A","addition"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe the design, methods, and social network structure of a randomized intervention for isolating respiratory infection cases in a university setting over a 10-week period. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 590 students in six residence halls enrolled in the eX-FLU study during a chain-referral recruitment process from September 2012\u2013January 2013. Of these, 262 joined as \u201Cseed\u201D participants, who nominated their social contacts to join the study, of which 328 \u201Cnominees\u201D enrolled. Participants were cluster-randomized by 117 residence halls. Participants were asked to respond to weekly surveys on health behaviors, social interactions, and influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Participants were randomized to either a 3-Day dorm room isolation intervention or a control group (no isolation) upon illness onset. ILI cases reported on their isolation behavior during illness and provided throat and nasal swab specimens at onset, day-three, and day-six of illness. A subsample of individuals (N = 103) participated in a sub-study using a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected sensor and contextually-dependent survey data on social interactions. Within the social network, participants were significantly positively assortative by intervention group, enrollment type, residence hall, iEpi participation, age, gender, race, and alcohol use (all P \u003C 0.002). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We identified a feasible study design for testing the impact of isolation from social networks in a university setting. These data provide an unparalleled opportunity to address questions about isolation and infection transmission, as well as insights into social networks and behaviors among college-aged students. Several important lessons were learned over the course of this project, including feasible isolation durations, the need for extensive organizational efforts, as well as the need for specialized programmers and server space for managing survey and smartphone data.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aiello, Allison E.; Simanek, Amanda M.; Eisenberg, Marisa C.; Walsh, Alison R.; Davis, Brian; Volz, Erik; Cheng, Caroline; Rainey, Jeanette J.; Uzicanin, Amra; Gao, Hongjiang; Osgood, Nathaniel; Knowles, Dylan; Stanley, Kevin; Tarter, Kara; Monto, Arnold S.","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f99e51643ef13f0cc0e5309df28da906764996b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4903923.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516000025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266848/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2016.01.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436516000025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Social networks","social interactions","participants","social contacts","randomized intervention","social network structure","intervention group","impact of isolation","isolation behavior","Day dorm room isolation intervention","feasible isolation durations","feasible study design","network design","illness onset","important points of intervention","intervention studies of respiratory infection transmission","residence halls","sub-study","smartphone data","respiratory infection cases","need","eX-FLU study","dependent survey data","ILI cases","university setting","iEpi participation","control group","health behaviors","important lessons","novel smartphone application","college-aged students","enrollment type","throat","server space","gender","nasal swab specimens","race","sensor","questions","weekly surveys","influenza","insights","chain-referral recruitment process","specialized programmers","extensive organizational efforts","alcohol use","course","project","unparalleled opportunity","methods","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODOLOGY","SIGNIFICANCE","cluster","subsample of individuals","nominees","symptoms","BACKGROUND","week period","CONCLUSIONS","seed"],"language":"en"},

Nanoluciferase (Nluc) insertion was used to compare the replication efficiency of all constructs after electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA from the different clones. Deletion of C, E1, E2 or the complete structural protein genome region (C-ERNS-E1-E2) prevented the production of infectious progeny virus, whereas deletion of ERNS still allowed the generation of infectious particles. However, those \u0394ERNS viral particles were defective in virus assembly and/or egress and could not be further propagated for more than three additional passages in porcine SK-6 cells. These \u0022defective in third cycle\u0022 BuPV \u0394ERNS mutants were subsequently used to express the classical swine fever virus envelope protein E2, the N-terminal domain of the Schmallenberg virus Gc-protein and the receptor binding domain of the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus spike protein. The constructs could be efficiently complemented and further passaged in SK-6 cells constitutively expressing the BuPV ERNS protein. Importantly, BuPV are able to infect a wide variety of target cell lines, allowing the expression in a very wide host spectrum. Therefore, we suggest that packaged BuPV \u0394ERNS replicon particles have the potential as broad spectrum viral vectors.IMPORTANCE The proteins Npro and ERNS are unique for the genus pestivirus, but only Npro was demonstrated to be non-essential for in vitro growth. While this was also speculated for ERNS, it was previously always shown that pestivirus replicons with deletions of the structural proteins ERNS, E1 or E2 did not produce any infectious progeny virus in susceptible host cells. Here, we could for the first time demonstrate that BuPV ERNS is dispensable for the generation of infectious virus particles, but still important for efficient passaging. The ERNS defective BuPV particles showed a clearly limited growth in cell culture, but were capable for several rounds of infection, expression of foreign genes and highly efficient trans-complementation to rescue virus replicon particles (VRP). The non-cytopathic characteristics and the absence of preexisting immunity to BuPV in human populations and livestock also provides a significant benefit for a possible use e.g. as a vector vaccine platform.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dalmann, Anja; Reimann, Ilona; Wernike, Kerstin; Beer, Martin","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00436-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ERNS","Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BuPV ERNS protein","ERNS defective BuPV particles","C-ERNS","BuPV replicons","deletion of ERNS","virus replicon particles","generation of infectious virus particles","structural proteins ERNS","BuPV \u0394ERNS mutants","virus assembly","E1-E2","packaged BuPV \u0394ERNS replicon particles","generation of infectious particles","infectious cDNA clone of BuPV","production of infectious progeny virus","Schmallenberg virus Gc-protein","\u0394ERNS viral particles","subgenomic Bungowannah virus","classical swine fever virus envelope protein E2","structural proteins C","proteins Npro","Deletion of C","complete structural protein genome region","deletions","wide host spectrum","susceptible host cells","pestivirus replicons","constructs","Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus spike protein","broad spectrum viral vectors","genome regions","cell culture","limited growth","efficient passaging","genus pestivirus","porcine SK","wide variety of target cell lines","N-terminal domain","expression of foreign genes","receptor binding domain","efficient trans-complementation","non-cytopathic characteristics","potential","IMPORTANCE","RNAs","absence of preexisting immunity","possible use","human populations","electroporation of","livestock","significant benefit","transcribed RNA","rounds of infection","basis","cycle","vector vaccine platform","replication efficiency","additional passages","insertion","different clones","time","VRP","Nanoluciferase","Nluc","egress"],"language":"en"},

Most existing global-focused programs (i.e. IB/AP) engender grave inequities in access and opportunities, particularly for urban youth, and do not often allow youth to critically interrogate the myriad injustices that plague the world. There is, however, a burgeoning body of scholarship centered on critical youth studies as a transformative process for youth development.

A cohort of 47 households (493 individuals) in coastal Kenya was recruited and followed for a 26-week period spanning a complete RSV season. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were requested weekly, during the first 4 weeks, and twice weekly thereafter from all household members, regardless of illness status. The samples were screened for a range of respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. Tests on 16 928 samples yielded 205 RSV infection episodes in 179 individuals (37.1%) from 40 different households. Eighty-six episodes (42.0%) were asymptomatic. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes were higher age, shorter duration of infection, bigger household size, lower peak viral load, absence of concurrent RSV infections within the household, infection by RSV group B, and no prior human rhinovirus infections. The propensity of RSV spread in households was dependent on symptom status and amount (duration and load) of virus shed. Conclusions.

Certainly, the protocol has room for further improvement as everyone\u0027s experience grows, but we hope that it could be a starting point, adaptable to different realities and local resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cosentino, Nicola; Assanelli, Emilio; Merlino, Luca; Mazza, Mario; Bartorelli, Antonio L.; Marenzi, Giancarlo","journal":"Can J Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2234d5044e5aeec07f4b20e205c625b03278bb8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376346/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X20303962?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X20303962","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS","University Cardiology Institute"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of ACS patients","management of ACS patients","ACS severity","risk of SARS","weeks","infection","protocol","risk of suspected SARS-CoV","cardiovascular emergencies","cardiovascular emergency referral center","initial experience","Government of Lombardy","appropriate standards of care","dedicated preventive measures","appropriate hospital ward","different realities","pathways","regional hub","limited number of centers","acute coronary syndrome","starting point","local resources","urgent need","order","University Cardiology Institute","outbreak","customized pathway","room","improvement","COVID","system","Italy","reason","use"],"language":"en"},

Both murine Fprs and human FPRs participate in many patho-physiological processes due to their expression on a variety of cell types in addition to myeloid cells. FPR contribution to numerous pathologies is in part due to its capacity to interact with a plethora of structurally diverse chemotactic ligands. One of the murine Fpr members, Fpr2, and its endogenous agonist peptide, Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), control normal mouse colon epithelial growth, repair and protection against inflammation-associated tumorigenesis.

(2011) Respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis: viral detection and clinical findings. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(3), 218\u2013223. Background Viral detection from different respiratory sample types in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is facilitated by available molecular methods, but optimum sampling strategies have not been identified. In addition, associations between viral detection and respiratory symptoms are not well described. Objectives Study goals were to compare molecular detection of viruses from concurrent upper airway and sputum samples in children with CF and to describe relative frequency of respiratory viral infections and identify potential clinical associations. Methods We conducted a 2\u2010year prospective surveillance study in 44 children with CF aged 6\u201318 years. Upper airway and sputum samples were collected quarterly and during pulmonary exacerbations and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses types 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses. Physical exams and symptom surveys were used to identify respiratory signs and symptoms. Results Upper airway samples were collected at 359 visits; concordance of PCR\u2010based viral detection was examined in a subset of paired upper airway and sputum samples from 21 participants at 92 visits. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus (23\u00B71% overall), and rhinovirus detection was the same for both sample types (21\u00B77% each). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of rhinovirus in sputum relative to upper airway sampling were 70% and 91\u00B77%, respectively. Respiratory symptoms associated with rhinovirus detection included increased cough, increased nasal congestion, increased sputum production, and wheezing. Conclusions A relatively high frequency of rhinovirus detection was observed by either upper airway or sputum samples, and clinical findings suggest a significant\u2010associated symptom burden.","publish_time":"2011-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burns, Jane L.; Emerson, Julia; Kuypers, Jane; Campbell, Angela P.; Gibson, Ronald L.; McNamara, Sharon; Worrell, Kelly; Englund, Janet A.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fe7366fd2acdb22f69d45c7373adf169a4636db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4941093.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00292.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21955319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of rhinovirus","Respiratory viruses","Upper airway samples","sputum samples","respiratory symptoms","molecular detection of viruses","Background Viral detection","upper airway sampling","respiratory signs","concurrent upper airway","high frequency of rhinovirus detection","children","sputum relative","respiratory syncytial virus","relative frequency of respiratory viral infections","different respiratory sample types","subset of paired upper airway","increased sputum production","parainfluenza viruses types","CF","clinical findings","cystic fibrosis","potential clinical associations","increased cough","visits","available molecular methods","associated symptom burden","symptom surveys","detected virus","optimum sampling strategies","Objectives Study goals","year prospective surveillance study","nasal congestion","RSV","human metapneumovirus","coronaviruses","rhinoviruses","pulmonary exacerbations","concordance of PCR","participants","Physical exams","Conclusions","wheezing","specificity","addition","adenoviruses","Sensitivity","years","paper"],"language":"en"},

However, intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity and viremia of porcine G9 RVAs has remained largely unreported. In this study, colostrum-deprived piglets were orally infected with a porcine G9P[23] or G9P[7] strain. Histopathologically, both strains induced characteristic small intestinal lesions. Degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were observed in the extra-intestinal tissues, but most predominantly in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). RVA antigen was continuously detected in the small intestinal mucosa and MLNs, but only transiently in cells of the liver, lung, and choroid plexus. Viral RNA levels were much higher in the feces and the MLNs compared to other tissues. The onset of viremia occurred at day post infection (DPI) 1 with the amount of viral RNA reaching its peak at DPI 3 or 5, before decreasing significantly at DPI 7 and remaining detectable until DPI 14. Our data suggest that porcine G9 RVAs have a strong small intestinal tropism, are highly virulent for piglets, have the ability to escape the small intestine, spread systemically via viremia, and replicate in extra-intestinal tissues. In addition, MLNs might act as a secondary site for viral amplification and the portal of systemic entry. These results add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of human G9 RVAs, and the validity of the pig model for use with both human and pig G9 RVAs in further studies.","publish_time":"2013-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ha-Hyun; Park, Jun-Gyu; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Kim, Hyun-Jeong; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Son, Kyu-Yeol; Ryu, Eun-Hye; Kim, Deok-Song; Lee, Woo Song; Kang, Mun-Il; Yang, Dong-Kun; Lee, Ju-Hwan; Park, Su-Jin; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2bdc5d35705dcbcbf7940b7398c21b228c22e1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117468.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513003064; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513003064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23827353/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.05.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","DPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extra-intestinal tissues","viremia of porcine G9 RVAs","pig G9 RVAs","small intestinal mucosa","MLNs","extra-intestinal pathogenicity","pathogenesis of human G9 RVAs","strong small intestinal tropism","characteristic small intestinal lesions","Abstract G9","small intestine","porcine G9P","onset of viremia","viral amplification","pigs","Viral RNA levels","pig model","necrosis of parenchymal cells","colostrum-deprived piglets","validity","strains","important pathogens","secondary site","liver","lung","portal of systemic entry","humans","ability","understanding","rotaviruses","day post infection","potential host reservoir","choroid plexus","study","Degeneration","mesenteric lymph nodes","feces","Histopathologically","studies","data","peak","RVA antigen","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: AHSG serum levels were determined in treatment-na\u00EFve newly-diagnosed patients, 96 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn\u0027s disease (CD), 62 with diarrhea-predominant or mixed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, D- and M- types) and 180 healthy controls (HC), by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years at the Gastroenterology Department of the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. C-reactive protein (CRP), anti-glycan antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies IgG, anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG, anti-laminariobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG and anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgA were also determined via immunonephelometry and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: The mean \u00B1 SE of serum AHSG, following adjustment for confounders, was 0.32 \u00B1 0.02 g/L in IBD, 0.32 \u00B1 0.03 g/L in CD and 0.34 \u00B1 0.03 g/L in UC patients, significantly lower than in IBS patients (0.7 \u00B1 0.018 g/L) and HC (0.71 \u00B1 0.02 g/L) (P \u003C 0.0001, in all cases). AHSG levels were comparable between the CD and UC groups. Based on AHSG levels IBD patients could be distinguished from HC with about 90% sensitivity and specificity. Further adjusted analysis verified the inverse association between AHSG and penetrating, as well as stricturing CD (partial correlation coefficient: -0.45 and -0.33, respectively) (P \u003C 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, inverse correlations between AHSG and CRP and the need for anti-TNF\u03B1 therapy or surgery, were found (partial correlation coefficients: -0.31, -0.33, -0.41, respectively, P \u003C 0.05, in all cases). Finally, IBD individuals who were seropositive, for at least one marker, had AHSG levels falling within the two lower quartiles (OR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.5-5.44, P \u003C 0.001) while those with at least two serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.03, 95%CI: 2.07-12.21, P \u003C 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex and smoking. CONCLUSION: AHSG can be used to distinguish between IBD and IBS patients or HC while at the same time \u0022predicting\u0022 complicated disease behavior, need for therapy escalation and surgery. Moreover, AHSG may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of IBD, since it is involved in key processes.","publish_time":"2017-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manolakis, Anastassios C; Christodoulidis, Gregory; Kapsoritakis, Andreas N; Georgoulias, Panagiotis; Tiaka, Elisavet K; Oikonomou, Kostas; Valotassiou, Varvara J; Potamianos, Spyros P","journal":"World J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64212980bf5953f369ec10e8a54517ec6ce10227.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5291848.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v23.i3.437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28210079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University Hospital","IBS","HC","AHSG","IBD"],"locations":["Greece"],"keyphrases":["AHSG levels IBD patients","AHSG serum levels","SE of serum AHSG","IBS patients","UC patients","anti-glycan antibodies","HC","anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG","anti-laminariobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG","pathogenesis of IBD","IBD individuals","anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgA","anti-TNF\u03B1 therapy","anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies IgG","serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations","Crohn\u0027s disease","stricturing CD","CRP","impact of inflammatory bowel disease","complicated disease behavior","surgery","UC groups","need","ELISA","cases","partial correlation coefficients","inverse association","inverse correlations","therapy escalation","lower quartiles","mixed irritable bowel syndrome","potential associations","\u03B12-Heremans","Gastroenterology Department","diarrhea-predominant","fetuin","Schmid Glycoprotein","lowest quartile","time","penetrating","University Hospital of Larissa","years","patient characteristics","predicting","C-reactive protein","enzyme","mean","adjustment","confounding factors","new insights","confounders","treatment-na\u00EFve","minimum period","adjusted analysis","types","Greece","immunosorbent assay","healthy controls","immunonephelometry","ulcerative colitis","METHODS","age","sex","smoking","RESULTS","sensitivity","key processes","specificity","AIM","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: We determined the quality of life (QoL) impact of children\u2019s influenza-like illness (ILI) on their parents. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in childcare centres and a general practice in Sydney, Australia. Using PAR-ENT-QoL, we measured QoL of parents of children aged 6 months\u20133 years before the 2010 influenza season, then again for parents of children with ILI (ILI group) using SF-12v2 Acute Form and PAR-ENT-QoL, and contemporaneously for parents of aged-matched children without ILI (non-ILI group). RESULTS: Of 381 children enrolled from 90 childcare centres, 105 developed ILI. PAR-ENT-QoL scores of the ILI group were significantly lower in the post-ILI follow-up interviews than at baseline (60.99 vs. 79.77, p \u003C 0.001), and those of non-ILI group at follow-up interviews (60.99 vs. 84.05, p \u003C 0.001). SF-12v2 scores of the ILI group were also significantly lower than those of non-ILI group: physical component summary (50.66 vs. 53.16, p = 0.011) and mental component summary (45.67 vs. 53.66, p \u003C 0.001). Two factors were significantly associated with parental QoL: total time spent caring child during ILI and whether the child had severe ILI or not. Correlations between PAR-ENT-QoL and SF-12v2 scores were satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Parents had significantly lower QoL while their child had ILI, compared with before ILI and with parents of children without ILI. The public health impact of ILI in children on the QoL in families is far from negligible. QoL measurement can complement economic evaluation of ILI disease burden and provide a more complete picture of impact.","publish_time":"2013-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, Maria Yui Kwan; Yin, Jiehui Kevin; Heron, Leon; Morrow, Angela; Dierig, Alexa; Booy, Robert; Leask, Julie","journal":"Qual Life Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0023258070e16dc764316f6797bfd03fea23ee07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088548.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-013-0606-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24370954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["developed ILI","severe ILI","non-ILI group","QoL of parents","lower QoL","QoL scores","parents of children","post-ILI follow-up interviews","public health impact of ILI","parental QoL","QoL measurement","economic evaluation of ILI disease burden","parents of aged","PAR-ENT","matched children","SF-12v2 scores","impact of children\u2019s influenza","SF-12v2 Acute Form","childcare centres","illness","caring child","influenza season","physical component summary","mental component summary","complete picture of impact","total time","general practice","excess paediatric morbidity","prospective cohort study","baseline","Sydney","years","quality of life","Australia","months","families","Correlations","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","factors","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Affected communities look for known symptoms, prevention measures, and treatment strategies. On the other hand, health organizations try to get situational updates to assess the severity of the outbreak, known affected cases, and other details. Recent emergence of social media platforms such as Twitter provide convenient ways and fast access to disseminate and consume information to/from a wider audience. Research studies have shown potential of this online information to address information needs of concerned authorities during outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. In this work, we target three types of end-users (i) vulnerable population\u2014people who are not yet affected and are looking for prevention related information (ii) affected population\u2014people who are affected and looking for treatment related information, and (iii) health organizations\u2014like WHO, who are interested in gaining situational awareness to make timely decisions.

METHODS: To better understand long-term effects and pathogenesis of this common, persistent brain infection, mice were infected at a time in human years equivalent to early to mid adulthood and studied 5\u201312 months later. Appearance, behavior, neurologic function and brain MRIs were studied. Additional analyses of pathogenesis included: correlation of brain weight and neurologic findings; histopathology focusing on brain regions; full genome microarrays; immunohistochemistry characterizing inflammatory cells; determination of presence of tachyzoites and bradyzoites; electron microscopy; and study of markers of inflammation in serum. Histopathology in genetically resistant mice and cytokine and NRAMP knockout mice, effects of inoculation of isolated parasites, and treatment with sulfadiazine or \u03B1PD1 ligand were studied. RESULTS: Twelve months after infection, a time equivalent to middle to early elderly ages, mice had behavioral and neurological deficits, and brain MRIs showed mild to moderate ventricular dilatation. Lower brain weight correlated with greater magnitude of neurologic abnormalities and inflammation. Full genome microarrays of brains reflected inflammation causing neuronal damage (Gfap), effects on host cell protein processing (ubiquitin ligase), synapse remodeling (Complement 1q), and also increased expression of PD-1L (a ligand that allows persistent LCMV brain infection) and CD 36 (a fatty acid translocase and oxidized LDL receptor that mediates innate immune response to beta amyloid which is associated with pro-inflammation in Alzheimer\u0027s disease). Immunostaining detected no inflammation around intra-neuronal cysts, practically no free tachyzoites, and only rare bradyzoites. Nonetheless, there were perivascular, leptomeningeal inflammatory cells, particularly contiguous to the aqueduct of Sylvius and hippocampus, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells, and activated microglia in perivascular areas and brain parenchyma. Genetically resistant, chronically infected mice had substantially less inflammation. CONCLUSION: In outbred mice, chronic, adult acquired T. gondii infection causes neurologic and behavioral abnormalities secondary to inflammation and loss of brain parenchyma. Perivascular inflammation is prominent particularly contiguous to the aqueduct of Sylvius and hippocampus. Even resistant mice have perivascular inflammation. This mouse model of chronic T. gondii infection raises questions of whether persistence of this parasite in brain can cause inflammation or neurodegeneration in genetically susceptible hosts.","publish_time":"2008-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hermes, Gretchen; Ajioka, James W; Kelly, Krystyna A; Mui, Ernest; Roberts, Fiona; Kasza, Kristen; Mayr, Thomas; Kirisits, Michael J; Wollmann, Robert; Ferguson, David JP; Roberts, Craig W; Hwang, Jong-Hee; Trendler, Toria; Kennan, Richard P; Suzuki, Yasuhiro; Reardon, Catherine; Hickey, William F; Chen, Lieping; McLeod, Rima","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/635bc39e204a9e098961ccaef51d67e83226b07e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2588578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-5-48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18947414/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Perivascular inflammation","brain MRIs","persistent brain infection","brain regions","pro-inflammation","resistant mice","infected mice","persistent LCMV brain infection","correlation of brain weight","Lower brain weight","loss of brain parenchyma","gondii infection","outbred mice","NRAMP knockout mice","neurologic findings","neurologic function","perivascular areas","effects of inoculation","greater magnitude of neurologic abnormalities","T cells","long-term effects","time equivalent","leptomeningeal inflammatory cells","Toxoplasma gondii","histopathology","aqueduct of Sylvius","hippocampus","months","behavioral abnormalities secondary","genome microarrays of brains","free tachyzoites","neuronal damage","rare bradyzoites","\u03B1PD1 ligand","early elderly ages","human years equivalent","intra-neuronal cysts","mouse model of chronic","Additional analyses of pathogenesis","oxidized LDL receptor","ubiquitin ligase","activated microglia","host cell protein processing","innate immune response","cytokine","fatty acid translocase","treatment","CD4","determination of presence","immunohistochemistry","Gfap","neurological deficits","beta amyloid","electron microscopy","isolated parasites","study of markers","sulfadiazine","mid adulthood","CD8","questions","persistence","moderate ventricular dilatation","synapse remodeling","neurodegeneration","unknown consequences","Appearance","susceptible hosts","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","serum","CONCLUSION","Immunostaining","expression of PD","people","METHODS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The role of S100A12 in parasite and viral infections is also difficult to study in traditional animal models due to the lack of S100A12 expression in rodents. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate fecal S100A12 concentrations in a cohort of puppies with intestinal parasites (Cystoisospora spp., Toxocara canis, Giardia sp.) and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs (coronavirus, parvovirus) as a comparative model. METHODS: Spot fecal samples were collected from 307 puppies [median age (range): 7 (4\u221213) weeks; 29 different breeds] in French breeding kennels, and fecal scores (semiquantitative system; scores 1\u221213) were assigned. Fecal samples were tested for Cystoisospora spp. (C. canis and C. ohioensis), Toxocara canis, Giardia sp., as well as canine coronavirus (CCV) and parvovirus (CPV). S100A12 concentrations were measured in all fecal samples using an in-house radioimmunoassay. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric 2-group or multiple-group comparisons, non-parametric correlation analysis, association testing between nominal variables, and construction of a multivariate mixed model. RESULTS: Fecal S100A12 concentrations ranged from \u003C 24\u221214,363 ng/g. Univariate analysis only showed increased fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs shedding Cystoisospora spp. (P = 0.0384) and in dogs infected with parvovirus (P = 0.0277), whereas dogs infected with coronavirus had decreased fecal S100A12 concentrations (P = 0.0345). However, shedding of any single enteropathogen did not affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (all P \u003E 0.05) in this study. Only fecal score and breed size had an effect on fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (P \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An infection with any single enteropathogen tested in this study is unlikely to alter fecal S100A12 concentrations, and these preliminary data are important for further studies evaluating fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs or when using fecal S100A12 concentrations as a biomarker in patients with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heilmann, Romy M.; Grellet, Aur\u00E9lien; Gr\u00FCtzner, Niels; Cranford, Shannon M.; Suchodolski, Jan S.; Chastant-Maillard, Sylvie; Steiner, J\u00F6rg M.","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/129341a52b43ccd59368d094950322d983ebe223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5905106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665827/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2841-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased fecal S100A12 concentrations","fecal scores","role of S100A12","Spot fecal samples","dogs","lack of S100A12 expression","study","multivariate analysis","Cystoisospora","parvovirus","biomarker of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation","Univariate analysis","chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation","gastrointestinal signs","Toxocara canis","effect of gastrointestinal pathogens","non-parametric correlation analysis","Giardia","canine coronavirus","multivariate mixed model","single enteropathogen","cohort of puppies","preliminary data","Previous data","viral infections","viral agents","comparative model","multiple-group comparisons","idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease","association testing","patients","studies","French breeding kennels","construction","nominal variables","clinical utility","intestinal parasites","breed size","different breeds","people","traditional animal models","semiquantitative system","CCV","ohioensis","median age","range","Statistical analyses","rodents","BACKGROUND","METHODS","in-house radioimmunoassay","RESULTS","weeks","CONCLUSIONS","CPV","aim"],"language":"en"},

The potent anti-inflammatory and ethnopharmacological properties of Lonicera japonica Thunb. (Caprifoliaceae) make it an excellent source of novel medicinal targets for the treatment of NASH. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of L. japonica ethanol extract (LJEE) on NASH in mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD) for eight weeks to promote the development of NASH. After development of the model, the mice were administered LJEE once daily via oral gavage at doses of 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg for another four weeks. Simultaneous treatments with LJEE (300 mg/kg/day) resulted in pronounced improvements in liver steatosis, ballooning degeneration, and inflammation. LJEE prevented MCDD-induced plasma level increases in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. LJEE significantly reduced hepatic malondialdehyde level and ameliorated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in MCDD-fed mice, which were associated with down-regulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 suppression of multiple proinflammatory and profibrotic genes. LJEE can prevent hepatic steatosis by reducing hepatic peroxisome acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression, as well as by inducing proliferator-activated receptor \u03B1 expression. In addition, the LJEE treatments caused significant reduction in the phosphorylated form of Jun N-terminal kinase along with an increase in the phosphorylated level of extra cellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Our study demonstrated the protective role of LJEE in ameliorating nutritional steatohepatitis.","publish_time":"2015-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tzeng, Thing-Fong; Tzeng, Yu-Cheng; Cheng, Yu-Jou; Liou, Shorong-Shii; Liu, I-Min","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0706374e8a8a5eaf3bff4d2555c0f0db11294755.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4632443.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu7105423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26506376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NASH","LJEE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LJEE treatments","hepatic inflammation","hepatic steatosis","protective role of LJEE","hepatic malondialdehyde level","hepatic tissue","development of NASH","treatment of NASH","J mice","hepatic peroxisome acyl-CoA","study","weeks","MCDD-induced plasma level increases","various degrees of inflammation","phosphorylated level of extra cellular signal-regulated kinase","aspartate aminotransferase","phosphorylated form","alanine aminotransferase","liver steatosis","progressive fibrosis","nutritional steatohepatitis","Simultaneous treatments","Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis","japonica ethanol extract","N-terminal kinase","ethnopharmacological properties of Lonicera japonica Thunb","proliferator-activated receptor \u03B1 expression","regulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 suppression of multiple proinflammatory","diacylglycerol acyltransferase","excellent source of novel medicinal targets","significant reduction","methionine-choline","profibrotic genes","potent anti-inflammatory","pronounced improvements","deficient diet","effects of","degeneration","fat accumulation","oral gavage","addition","model","doses","day","Caprifoliaceae","C57BL","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, cell culture may still have added value in identifying viruses not detected by PCR. Objectives We aimed to estimate the yield and clinical impact of routine respiratory virus culture among children with a negative PCR result. Study design A retrospective cohort study was performed from Jan. 2013 to Sept. 2015. Respiratory samples from hospitalized or immunocompromised patients \u003C18years old were routinely inoculated on traditional tube cell culture monolayers if they tested negative by a PCR assay for 12 respiratory viruses. We studied patients with a respiratory specimen negative by PCR and positive by culture. Duplicates and samples of sold services were excluded. Data on demographics, clinical history, laboratory findings, and patient management were collected from patients\u2019 charts. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were performed. Results Overall, 4638 PCR-negative samples were inoculated in cell culture. Of those, 196 (4.2%) were cell culture positive, and 144 met study inclusion criteria. Most subjects (81.9%) were hospitalized. Mean age was 2.4\u00B13.4years. The viruses most frequently isolated were cytomegalovirus (33.3%) and enteroviruses (19.4%). Cell culture results prompted a change in management in 5 patients (3.5%), all of whom had acyclovir initiated for localized HSV-1 infection. Four of these had skin or mucosal lesions that could be sampled to establish a diagnosis. Conclusion In children, routine viral culture on respiratory specimens that were negative by PCR has low yield and minimal clinical impact.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"AlGhounaim, M.; Xiao, Y.; Caya, C.; Papenburg, J.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/849eb28d4a8f89aea0ad63e33503af1c1974c3d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106410.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217302135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802185/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.07.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217302135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR-negative samples","cell culture positive","Cell culture results","Respiratory samples","respiratory viruses","negative PCR result","respiratory specimen negative","PCR assay","clinical impact of routine respiratory virus culture","routine viral culture","respiratory specimens","traditional tube cell culture monolayers","respiratory virus testing","children","clinical history","minimal clinical impact","immunocompromised patients","retrospective cohort study","study inclusion criteria","patient management","low yield","years old","laboratory findings","reference standard","Abstract Background Polymerase chain reaction","demographics","change","Conclusion","localized HSV","patients\u2019 charts","cytomegalovirus","Data","value","skin","mucosal lesions","multivariate statistics","acyclovir","infection","Mean age","Duplicates","services","enteroviruses","Objectives","subjects","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

We have previously reported that dendritic cells (DCs) might be involved in the immune escape mechanisms for SARS-CoV. In this study, we focussed on the gene expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), chemokine receptors (CCRs) and death receptor ligands in SARS-CoV infected DCs. We also compared adult and cord blood (CB) DCs to find a possible explanation for the age-dependent severity of SARS. RESULTS: Our results demonstrates that SARS-CoV did not modulate TLR-1 to TLR-10 gene expression but significantly induced the expression of CCR-1, CCR-3, and CCR-5. There was also strong induction of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), but not Fas ligand gene expression in SARS-CoV infected DCs. Interestingly, the expressions of most genes studied were higher in CB DCs than adult DCs. CONCLUSION: The upregulation of chemokines and CCRs may facilitate DC migration from the infection site to the lymph nodes, whereas the increase of TRAIL may induce lymphocyte apoptosis. These findings may explain the increased lung infiltrations and lymphoid depletion in SARS patients. Further explorations of the biological significance of these findings are warranted.","publish_time":"2009-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Law, Helen KW; Cheung, Chung Yan; Sia, Sin Fun; Chan, Yuk On; Peiris, JS Malik; Lau, Yu Lung","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a600310d78ebe675d0d7bc5d9188a77d73e0e79a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2700820.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19505311/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-10-35","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infected DCs","SARS outbreak","SARS patients","CB DCs","adult DCs","expression of CCR","gene expression of toll","age-dependent severity of SARS","Fas ligand gene expression","CCRs","findings","RESULTS","chemokine receptors","related apoptosis","increase of TRAIL","lymphocyte apoptosis","study of human responses","death receptor ligands","lymphoid depletion","increased lung infiltrations","infection site","DC migration","unique opportunity","possible explanation","TLRs","lymph nodes","strong induction of TNF","upregulation of chemokines","genes","cord blood","immune escape mechanisms","novel virus","biological significance","explorations","CONCLUSION","expressions","dendritic cells","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

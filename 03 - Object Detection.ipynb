{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Object Detection\n","\n","*Object detection* is a form of computer vision in which a machine learning model is trained to classify individual instances of objects in an image, and indicate a *bounding box* that marks its location. You can think of this as a progression from *image classification* (in which the model answers the question \"what is this an image of?\") to building solutions where we can ask the model \"what objects are in this image, and where are they?\".\n","\n","![A robot identifying fruit](./images/object-detection.jpg)\n","\n","For example, a grocery store might use an object detection model to implement an automated checkout system that scans a conveyor belt using a camera, and can identify specific items without the need to place each item on the belt and scan them individually.\n","\n","The **Custom Vision** cognitive service in Microsoft Azure provides a cloud-based solution for creating and publishing custom object detection models.\n","\n","## Create a Custom Vision resource\n","\n","To use the Custom Vision service, you need an Azure resource that you can use to train a model, and a resource with which you can publish it for applications to use. You can use the same resource for each of these tasks, or you can use different resources for each to allocate costs separately provided both resources are created in the same region. The resource for either (or both) tasks can be a general **Cognitive Services** resource, or a specific **Custom Vision** resource. Use the following instructions to create a new **Custom Vision** resource (or you can use an existing resource if you have one).\n","\n","1. In a new browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.\n","2.
